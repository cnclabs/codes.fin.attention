overview we design  develop and market mixed signal semiconductors that enable and enhance the features and capabilities of small panel displays 
our core products are color display drivers with integrated controllers  which are critical components in displays used in mobile consumer electronics devices 
we began operations in and began commercially shipping our products in the third quarter of we focus on the design  development and marketing of our products and outsource all of the fabrication  assembly and testing of our products to outside subcontractors 
we believe this concentrated focus enables us to provide our customers with critical time to market and product differentiation advantages 
we sell our semiconductor products directly to display module manufacturers  which incorporate our products into their display module subassemblies for mobile handset manufacturers and other consumer electronic devices 
we currently generate all of our revenue from customers in asia 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders that may be cancelled or the shipment dates delayed by the customer 
we operate in one operating segment  comprising the design  development and marketing of mixed signal semiconductors for small panel displays 
although some of our products are suitable for use in other consumer electronic device markets  we have primarily focused on the mobile handset market 
the mobile handset market is characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition among a concentrated group of manufacturers  and continually changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  continually evolving mobile handset specifications and significant price competition 
to be successful  we must be able to introduce new products that satisfy the evolving technology and product specifications in an efficient and timely manner 
in addition  in the past  mobile handset manufacturers have inaccurately forecast consumer demand  which has led to significant changes in orders to their component suppliers 
we have experienced both increases and decreases in orders due to changes in demand and delays in production by our customers  often with limited advance notice  and we expect such order changes to occur in the future 
total revenue was million in  a decrease of from million in unit shipments were million in  a decrease of as compared to total costs and expenses likewise decreased to million in as compared to million in our net loss was million in as compared to net income of million in from our inception through  our revenue was derived almost exclusively from sales of k color super twisted nematic  or cstn  and organic light emitting diode  or oled  devices 
beginning in late and 
table of contents continuing through  the market migrated to next generation k cstn devices and thin film transistor  or tft  devices 
in addition  demand for oled devices declined dramatically in due to the relatively higher cost of oled display modules compared to cstn display modules 
this market transition occurred at a time when we did not have sufficient competitive products available to meet the changing market 
sales of our k cstn and new tft products did not increase rapidly enough in to compensate for substantial declines in sales of our k cstn and oled products 
as a result  our fiscal operating results suffered 
we are now focusing on introducing new low cost versions of our k cstn products and increasing our sales of tft devices  which we believe will be the prominent technologies for small panel displays for the next several years 
the decrease in cost of revenue during was primarily driven by the revenue decreases 
during  we increased our headcount to support long term business growth  to expand our engineering and sales capabilities  and to provide for the additional administrative requirements of a public company 
we believe this investment was necessary to pursue business opportunities and establish infrastructure for future growth  although we cannot assure you that we will successfully generate future revenue in line with these headcount increases 
we currently expect that headcount in the near term will remain relatively flat compared to the end of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates  which are discussed further below 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions eg  stock based compensation  depreciation methodology  etc we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates revenue recognition  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory reserve  warranty obligations  income taxes and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  most of our sales were to large established companies based on purchase orders from these customers with minimal collectibility issues 
customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collectibility based 
table of contents primarily on the credit worthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria will not be met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we perform credit evaluations of each of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon any specific customer collection issues we have identified and our best estimate of allowance requirements 
while we have not experienced any significant credit losses to date  we may experience substantially higher credit loss rates in the future 
our accounts receivable are generally concentrated in a limited number of customers  and we expect them to remain concentrated in the future 
we may increase our credit risk as we expand our limited customer base due to the credit worthiness of newer customers compared with our existing customers 
any significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any current or future customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserve 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost computed on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories by comparing quantity on hand with forecasted future sales based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory reserve may be required 
we specifically reserve for lower of cost or market if pricing trends or forecasts indicate that the carrying value of our inventory exceeds its estimated selling price less the cost to dispose of inventory 
the reserve is reviewed each period to ensure that it reflects changes in our actual experience 
once inventory is written down  a new accounting basis is established and  accordingly  it is not written back up in future periods 
our inventory reserve requirements may change in future periods based on actual experience  the life cycles of our products or market conditions 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality assessment  our warranty obligation may be affected by future product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we regularly monitor product returns and maintain a reserve for warranty expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimation process is based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
from time to time  we may be subject to additional costs related to warranty claims from our customers 
if this occurs in a future period  we would make judgments and estimates to establish the related warranty liability  based on historical experience  communication with our customers  and various assumptions based on the circumstances 
this additional warranty would be recorded in the determination of net income in the period in which the additional cost was identified 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is 
table of contents assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax strategies and to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  and revise our estimates  if necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our effective tax rate  income tax provision and net income 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty in the application of complex tax laws 
we record tax reserves for additional taxes that we estimate we may be required to pay as a result of potential examinations by tax authorities 
if such payments ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the reversal of these tax reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine such reserves are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation cost is recognized based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value 
this model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the fair value 
we review these assumptions periodically and modify them as conditions change 
we analyze our stock price volatility and that of peer companies to determine the reasonableness of this variable 
we have had minimal experience with option exercises since our initial public offering in june  and therefore currently rely on management s best estimate of the expected time until exercise of new stock option grants 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
we amortize deferred stock based compensation on the graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the stock options  which is generally four years 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in accelerated vesting as compared to the straight line method 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
under sfas no 
r  we will be required to measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
we will adopt sfas no 
r beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an adverse impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations as a percentage of total revenue for the three years ended december  years ended december  total revenue cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income loss net income loss total revenue change change in thousands total revenue total revenue was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in we shipped approximately million units in  which represented a decrease of compared to the approximately million units we shipped in the decline in revenue is primarily the result of the market transitioning from older k cstn and oled devices to newer k cstn and tft products at a time when we did not have sufficient competitive products available to meet the changing market 
while we experienced growth in sales of k cstn  tft and monochrome stn devices in  these increases were not sufficient to compensate for the significant declines in sales of k cstn and oled devices 
display driver price is a function of technology as well as the maturity of the device sold 
our average selling price declined from in to in  reflecting overall price erosion in the display driver market due to competitive conditions  the technology mix in our products sold and a greater proportion of our sales from mature products in while we currently expect sales in to increase as compared to sales  any such increases are dependent on market acceptance of recently introduced products and further introduction of new products  particularly new tft products and new low cost versions of our k cstn products 
total revenue increased to million in as compared to million in unit shipments increased to approximately million units in as compared to approximately million units in  as mobile handset models using our display drivers experienced higher sales  we expanded our product offering and our products were included in more mobile handset designs 
while total revenue increased substantially in compared to  we experienced a decline in revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of this decline was primarily the result of significant reductions in shipments of our oled devices  with increases in shipments of our cstn products unable to compensate for such oled declines 
revenue by customer of revenue for the years ended december  of accounts receivable at december  samsung sdi hosiden corporation philips mobile display systems less than 
table of contents substantially all of our revenue in  and has been generated from sales to a very small number of customers 
historically  our largest customers have been samsung sdi co  including its wholly owned subsidiary samsung oled co 
ltd  and philips mobile display systems  or philips mds  which collectively accounted for  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
in  a third customer  hosiden corporation  accounted for of our revenue 
revenue from samsung sdi decreased in absolute dollars in compared to reflecting lower sales of our oled products  partially offset by new demand for our stn products 
revenue from philips mds declined significantly in as compared to  reflecting the product and technology transitions to newer generation tft and cstn devices 
although philips mds represented a smaller percentage of our revenue in  we expect this customer to remain significant to our business in the future 
while we seek to add additional customers  existing customers may reduce their demand  as has occurred in the past  which could cause period to period fluctuations between customers representing significant amounts of our revenue 
revenue by geography the following table summarizes revenue by geographic region  based on the country in which the customer is located years ended december  china korea taiwan other total revenue approximately million  million and million of our sales were invoiced in korean won for  and  respectively 
all other sales were invoiced in us dollars 
cost of revenue of total revenue of total revenue of total revenue in thousands cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of purchasing fabricated silicon wafers 
we do not have long term fixed price supply contracts with our foundry contractors  therefore our wafer costs could fluctuate with the cyclical demand for semiconductors and availability of foundry capacity 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from foundries  we also face the yield risk associated with manufacturing these wafers into finished products 
cost of revenue also includes costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of our products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  and occupancy costs 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue has varied from quarter to quarter based on the mix of products  foundry prices  average selling prices and seasonality of demand for our products 
we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future 
cost of revenue in  compared to  decreased million  or  primarily due to revenue declines 
as a percent of revenue  cost of revenue increased to in  as compared to in the increase as a percent of revenue was due to lower average selling prices as compared to the prior period  our mix of products sold and spreading our fixed costs over a smaller revenue base 
the lower average selling prices resulted from competitive pricing pressure by handset makers that drove down component costs  including display drivers 
in addition  a greater percent of our sales were of mature products  which generally had lower selling prices 
finally  with the significant decrease in revenue  our fixed costs were spread over a smaller 
table of contents revenue base  increasing these costs as a percent of sales 
we recorded a charge of million to write down inventory in due to inventory quantities on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
the impact of the lower average selling prices was partially mitigated by reductions in wafer and test costs 
wafer costs may vary substantially in the future based on capacity at wafer foundries and wafer volumes purchased 
cost of revenue increased marginally as a percent of revenue in compared to due primarily to reductions in average selling prices of our products as a result of our product mix and greater price sensitivity in the mobile handset market  which drove down component prices 
additionally  we recorded a charge of million to write down inventory in due to inventory quantities on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
these cost increases were partially offset by better manufacturing yields realized by our subcontractor suppliers due to maturity in the manufacturing processes  as well as our fixed costs being spread over a higher revenue base 
research and development change change in thousands research and development of total revenue research and development expenses consist of costs related to development  testing  evaluation  masking revisions  compensation and related costs for personnel  occupancy costs and depreciation on research and development equipment 
research and development expenses include stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses may fluctuate in future periods due to timing of wafer qualification costs as well as the timing and number of new products under development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in research and development expenses was largely due to decreases in stock based compensation expenses of million 
additionally  we reduced wafer process fees by million  costs associated with qualifying new products and processes by million and costs of test wafers and mask sets by million 
these reductions were due to more efficient wafer qualification activities 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million associated with increased headcount and related infrastructure expenses during  to support our business plan and pursue growth opportunities  and an increase of million due to higher depreciation expense on equipment and software purchased to assist in new product design 
wafer qualification costs are likely to fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of such activities 
research and development expenses increased both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue in compared to approximately million of the increase in was due to greater development activities for test wafers and mask sets related to new products and related process technologies 
approximately million of the increase was due to higher stock based compensation expenses and the remaining million of increase was due to headcount increases to support additional product development activities associated with a larger number of new products under development 
selling  general and administrative change change in thousands selling  general and administrative of total revenue selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs of personnel in general management  sales  finance and information technology  as well as outside legal and accounting costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million  or  compared with  despite our significant revenue decrease 
approximately million of the increase was due to additional headcount and related infrastructure to support our long term growth prospects 
consulting costs  primarily related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  increased approximately million 
an additional million of the increase was due to legal  accounting and insurance costs incurred as a public company 
accounting costs in particular increased due to higher audit fees in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
legal cost increases resulted from the securities class action lawsuit 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in stock based compensation of million 
the increase in expenses in was also the result of being a public company for the entire year compared to only six months in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses during the first two quarters of to remain relatively flat with the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of  excluding the impact of stock based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared with approximately million of the increase in was due to stock based compensation 
headcount to support our significant revenue growth and the expansion of our infrastructure increased million to support a larger and more complex operation 
the remaining increase was due to increases in legal  accounting and insurance costs resulting from our growth and additional costs required of a public reporting company 
excluding stock based compensation  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat as a percent of revenue in as compared to as the absolute dollar increase was in line with our revenue growth 
interest and other income expense  net change change in thousands interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net in was up million  or  compared to we earned interest income of million in and million in  with the increase primarily due to higher average cash balances from the proceeds of our initial public offering and secondarily due to higher average interest rates in we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million in and foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million in we initiated hedging contracts in the second quarter of to minimize exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in future periods and hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposure 
the increase in interest and other income expense  net in as compared to was primarily due to interest income earned on our increased average cash balances as a result of approximately million in proceeds from our initial public offering in june provision for income taxes change change in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate of total revenue we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in and a provision for income taxes of million in  resulting in effective tax rates of and for the respective periods 
although we incurred cumulative losses in  we are subject to taxes in the various countries where we operate  therefore  our effective tax rate is dependent on the mix of activities by country 
our tax rate for is not indicative of the rate we would expect on a consolidated basis if we generated consolidated net income 
our net income loss 
table of contents includes nondeductible stock based compensation expense of million in and million in these charges unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate approximately for and for the provision for income taxes increased in compared to in both absolute dollars and in the effective tax rate 
the increase in absolute dollars was due to our higher pre tax income in the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to was primarily due to the significant increase in stock based compensation expense  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the stock based compensation expense in both and our effective tax rate would have been and  respectively 
in  we released our million valuation allowance as we concluded it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be fully recovered due to the significant improvement in operating results 
this lowered our effective tax rate for liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and through cash generated from operations 
working capital increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from our initial public offering in  but decreased to million at december  due primarily to our net loss in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for we incurred a net loss of million in  compared to net income of million in for  use of cash in operating activities related to an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  as well as non cash charges to deferred stock based compensation expense of million and inventory reserve of million 
accounts receivable decreased million in  but increased million in the decrease in was due to decreased revenue and the timing of customer payments  while the increase in was due to timing of customer payments 
our days sales outstanding were at december  and at december  we expect days sales outstanding typically to range from to days 
inventory before reserves increased by million in and increased by million in the increase in reflects a broader product portfolio than in the prior year  requiring us to maintain a larger inventory balance 
additionally  some of our newer customers have less visibility into future ordering patterns  requiring us to maintain larger inventory balances to meet greater swings in order demand 
we increased inventory late in for specific tft market opportunities  with certain of these programs delayed by key customers 
lastly  inventory balances were exceptionally low at the end of due to low forecasted revenue for the first quarter of due to the significant increase in net inventory in as compared to  our annualized inventory turns decreased to in the fourth quarter of as compared to approximately in the fourth quarter of we expect inventory turns to normally trend between to in order to effectively manage inventory volumes  we must carefully monitor forecasted sales by device due to the relatively long manufacturing process for semiconductors and risk of obsolescence in a rapidly evolving industry 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our inventory balances to minimize obsolescence and meet rapidly changing customer demand  and any failure to effectively manage inventory could harm our revenues and profitability 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in and decreased million in the decrease in reflects lower inventory purchasing due to lower sales 
the decrease in was due to timing of inventory payments related to inventory purchasing activity 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  sales or maturities of available for sale securities were million in while purchases of securities were million  as a larger portion of our investments were held in securities classified as cash equivalents 
cash and short term investment balances may fluctuate significantly in future quarters as we manage our investment mix 
all investments comply with our corporate investment policy  with our primary objective being the preservation of principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we closely monitor the investment yield curve and may in the future invest more of our cash in securities considered short term investments rather than cash equivalents 
in  we used million of cash for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily for equipment and software for our design engineers and secondarily for furniture and leasehold improvements for our facility in the united states and expansion of our facility in korea 
in  we invested million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and operating cash flow in short term investments 
we also purchased million of fixed assets  primarily for test equipment in korea and buildouts of newly leased facilities in our international locations 
other investing activities in included the release of million of cash no longer restricted in connection with a letter of credit that expired in net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in  the net cash provided by financing activities was almost entirely due to proceeds from issuance of our common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
in  financing cash flows included net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in june in order to secure manufacturing capacity at our foundry  assembly and test suppliers we may be required to make substantial purchase commitments or prepayments in future periods 
if we enter into such agreements  our cash flow could be negatively impacted in the short term 
we also may enter into agreements that commit us to purchase minimum quantities of wafers or utilize minimum quantities of back end assembly and test resources in order to secure capacity or to achieve favorable prices 
we currently do not have long term agreements with any of these suppliers 
we may be required to increase our inventory balances so we can meet rapid increases in product demand from our customers 
any such arrangements could significantly increase our inventory balances and create short term decreases in cash flow due to the longer period between inventory purchase and customer payment 
we believe that our cash balance and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  including potential cash requirements for wafer  assembly or test prepayments or inventory increases discussed above 
significant financial requirements  such as the acquisition of another company or research and development efforts in a new technology  may result in the need for additional cash to fund these new requirements as well as our ongoing business activities 
if needed  we would seek to obtain equity or debt financing to fund these activities 
we cannot assure you that equity or debt financing will be available when needed or  if available  that the financing will be on terms satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we currently have no plans that would require us to seek additional cash 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of voluntary changes in accounting principle 
in the event of a voluntary change in accounting principle  sfas no 
requires the change to be accounted for retrospectively in prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting change  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect correction of an error 

table of contents in addition  in the event that an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  sfas no 
requires that the change be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to voluntary changes in accounting principle and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the statement is an amendment of apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
under sfas no 
r  companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
share based compensation arrangements include stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
public companies will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
r beginning in the first quarter of sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
we will recognize stock based compensation expense on all awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations purchase obligations are comprised of orders for materials and services to build our inventory 
we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance of required delivery dates  and we are obligated to pay for them in accordance with the payment terms 
we expect to receive and pay for substantially all inventory purchased under these purchase obligations within the next three months
