item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a designer and manufacturer of telecommunications equipment supplied to telephone and broadband network providers worldwide and of water storage products marketed primarily in australia 
in addition to company manufactured products  the company markets complementary products manufactured by third parties 
the company sells products directly to broadband operators and telephone companies throughout the united states  canada  australia  asia  europe  the middle east and africa and certain other international markets  principally within developed nations 
the company s customers of water storage products in australia are typically individual users who will keep the product for several years without a repeat purchase 
the company believes that many of its customers periodically review their supply relationships and consequently the company can experience significant changes in buying patterns from specific customers between fiscal periods 
the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog with sales and operating results in any quarter principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  causes the company s operating results to be at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
the company uses numerous raw materials in its manufacturing processes 
although management believes that the company has adequate sources of supply for such raw materials  increases in the market prices of the company s raw materials could significantly increase the company s cost of goods sold and materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s profitability may also be materially and adversely affected by decreases in its sales volume because many of the costs associated with the company s facilities  product development  engineering  tooling and other manufacturing processes are essentially fixed in nature and must be spread over its sales base in order to maintain historical levels of profitability 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates and assumptions that management believes have the most significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements are accounts receivables reserves allowances for excess and obsolete inventory valuation of goodwill and long lived assets restructuring costs accounting for income taxes foreign currency translation accounts receivable reserves and estimated sales returns 
allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
provisions for uncollectible accounts are made based upon specific percentages of the past due outstanding accounts receivable aging categories 
the specific percentages are based on historical experience and are applied to the categories of accounts that are past due by   and days 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimate of percentages required for the provisions for doubtful accounts 
provisions for estimated sales returns are made based on the company s historical sales returns experience 
allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
the estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including historical sales and usage of items in inventory  current levels of orders and backlog  forecasted demand  product life cycle and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
in the event management adjusts estimates such as forecasted sales or expected product lifecycles  the value of the company s inventory may become understated or overstated and recognition of such understatement or overstatement will affect cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect the company s operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets 
management reviews goodwill and long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  and or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated from these assets 
future cash flows may be adversely impacted by operating performance  market conditions and other factors 
an impairment charge would be based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is estimated by management based on market prices  if available  and or forecasted discounted cash flows  using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
as of december   there was no impairment in the company s valuation of goodwill 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
one time severance benefits for employees terminated are recorded at the time management commits to the plan to reduce the work force  knows the amount of the termination benefit  is unlikely to change the plan and has communicated to employees the intended work force reduction 
liabilities for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without an economic benefit  such as for facility lease payments for premises vacated  are recorded when the company ceases to use the right conveyed by the contract 
in the case of vacated leased facilities  the liability is based on the future lease payments required under the contract less the estimated future rental income the company may earn by subletting the facilities or estimates of costs incurred to terminate a lease with a landlord 
these estimates of future sublet income are based on current economic conditions  current condition of the local leasing market  past experience and judgments supplied by professionals in the local real estate market 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and may change 
additional charges could be required as a result in the changes in estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are recorded for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
management records the actual current income tax payable and assesses the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes requires recognition of future tax benefits attributable to tax net loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management has determined  based on historical profit trends  that in the company s domestic operations  there is not sufficient evidence to support the position that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the benefits will be realized 
as such  management has provided a full valuation allowance to the extent of net deferred assets on the domestic operations 
with regard to the company s foreign operations  management has determined  based on historical profit trends  that it is more likely than not that all of the benefits will be realized 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the company s ability to realize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from management estimates and management adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
foreign currency translation 
the company has foreign subsidiaries that together accounted for of the company s net revenues and of the company s assets as of and for the year ended december  in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is required to translate the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the currencies in which they keep their accounting records into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the company s statement of operations or as a separate part of the company s net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
under relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses depends upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
this determination involves consideration of relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures  would be considered the functional currency 
however  management must also consider any dependency of the subsidiary upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations 
if management deems any subsidiary s functional currency to be its local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
however  if management deems the functional currency to be united states dollars  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within the company s statement of operations 
if the company disposes of any of its subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into the company s statement of operations 
if management determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to united states dollars  then any translation gains or losses arising after the date of the change would be included within the company s statement of operations 
based on management s assessment of the factors discussed above  the company considers the functional currency of each of its international subsidiaries to be each subsidiary s local currency 
accordingly  the company had cumulative translation gains of million that were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive gain within the company s balance sheet at december  during the year ended december   the company included translation adjustments of a loss of approximately million under accumulated other comprehensive income and loss 
if the company had determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries was united states dollars  these gains or losses would have decreased or increased the company s loss for the year ended december  the magnitude of these gains or losses depends upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which the company transacted business as compared to the value of the united states dollar 
these currencies primarily include the british pound  the canadian dollar and the australian dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those the company recorded for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation  when incurred  if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the interpretation is effective for the company no later than the end of the fiscal year ending on december  the implementation of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment statement r 
this statement is a revision to statement  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
the company adopted statement r on january   using the modified prospective method  requiring compensation cost to be recognized as expense for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using the black scholes option pricing model under statement for pro forma disclosures 
the effect of adopting statement r will decrease the company s pretax net income by approximately during in november  the fasb issued sfas no
