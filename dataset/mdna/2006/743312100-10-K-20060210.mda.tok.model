we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations 
in the first six months of fiscal  as well as in fiscal years through  the weakening of the us dollar against most major currencies  primarily the euro and the british pound  positively affected our results

the fourth operating unit  datadirect  provides standards based data connectivity software 
during fiscal years  and  we completed a number of acquisitions  including excelon corporation in december  datadirect technologies limited in december  persistence software inc in november  apama  inc in april and easyask  inc 
in may these acquisitions were designed to expand the size and breadth of our business and or add complementary products and technologies to existing product sets 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have consummated the following transactions on april   we acquired the stock of apama  inc apama for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired

neon is a provider of mainframe integration products and services 
the purpose of the acquisition was to broaden the product offerings of datadirect 
upon the closing of the transaction  neon became part of our datadirect operating unit 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
when such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectibility 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible assets we had goodwill and net intangible assets of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize discounted cash flow models or valuation reports from third party firms to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in the models and valuation reports 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 

table of contents income tax accounting we had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items as a percentage of total revenue  and the percentage change in dollar amounts of such items compared with the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year 
percentage of total revenue period to period change compared compared year ended november  to to revenue software licenses maintenance and services total revenue costs of revenue cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and services amortization of acquired intangibles for purchased technology total costs of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of other acquired intangibles compensation expense from repurchase of subsidiary stock options acquisition related expenses  net total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
our total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our revenue increased principally due to increased volume of software license and maintenance sales for of all of our major product lines 
in addition  approximately two percentage points of the revenue increase is attributable to favorable changes in currency exchange rates from those in effect in fiscal to those in effect during fiscal revenue from the progress openedge product line increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue derived from the sonic product line increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue from the real time product line increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue from the datadirect product line increased from 
table of contents million in fiscal to million in fiscal we estimate that revenue from the products obtained in the acquisitions of persistence  apama and easyask contributed less than of total revenue in fiscal software license revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in software license revenue in fiscal was primarily due to growth from the datadirect  real time and sonic product lines 
these product lines accounted for of software license revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal software license revenue from indirect channels  including application partners and oems  and from sales to direct end users  both increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal software license revenue from the progress openedge product set increased year over year  primarily within the deployment and management products 
approximately two percentage points of the increase in software license revenue is attributable to favorable changes in currency exchange rates from those in effect in fiscal to those in effect during fiscal maintenance and services revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in maintenance and services revenue was primarily the result of growth in our installed customer base  renewal of maintenance agreements and an increase in professional services revenue 
approximately two percentage points of the increase in maintenance and services revenue is attributable to favorable changes in currency exchange rates from those in effect in fiscal to those in effect during fiscal total revenue generated in markets outside north america increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal revenue from the three major regions outside of north america  consisting of emea  latin america and asia pacific  each increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue generated in markets outside north america would have represented of total revenue if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of business derived from international operations in fiscal is primarily the result of the higher percentage increase generated in markets within north america 
we anticipate total revenue in fiscal to be in the range of million to million  representing an increase of to as compared to fiscal this revenue expectation assumes the continued success of our application partners and other channel partners  continued improvement in our ability to generate new business in end user accounts and continued growth and success from the newer product lines of datadirect  real time and sonic 
this revenue expectation also includes expected amounts from the recently completed neon and actional acquisitions 
however  many factors  including external factors such as geopolitical issues or a significant strengthening of the us dollar against currencies from which we derive a significant portion of our business  could negatively impact this revenue expectation 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of costs of product media  documentation  duplication  packaging  electronic software distribution  royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of software licenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of software license revenue from to 
the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower third party product sales and increased adoption by customers of electronic software delivery 
cost of software licenses as a percentage of software license revenue may vary from period to period depending upon the relative product mix 
however  we expect the cost of software licenses for fiscal to remain at the lower end of the past few years historical range of to of the related software license revenue 
cost of maintenance and services 
cost of maintenance and services consists primarily of costs of providing customer technical support  education and consulting 
cost of maintenance and services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of maintenance and services revenue from to 
the maintenance and services revenue margin improvement was due to maintenance revenue  which has a substantially higher margin than professional services revenue  representing a greater proportion of the total maintenance and services revenue in the total dollar amount in fiscal increased due to the impact of year over year changes in exchange rates and headcount related expenses 
our technical support  education and consulting headcount decreased by less than from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal 
table of contents amortization of acquired intangibles for purchased technology 
amortization of acquired intangibles for purchased technology primarily represents the amortization of the value assigned to intangible assets obtained in business combinations 
amortization of acquired intangibles for purchased technology increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of apama and easyask 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the gross profit percentage increased from of total revenue in fiscal to of total revenue in fiscal due primarily to slight improvements in the margins of both software license sales as well as maintenance and services revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to the addition of sales and marketing personnel and related expenses resulting from the acquisitions of persistence  apama and easyask  as well as a slight increase in variable compensation expense as a result of increased sales 
expenses also increased due to the impact of year over year changes in exchange rates  as a significant percentage of sales and marketing expenses are incurred outside of north america 
in fiscal sales and marketing expenses included million of stock based compensation related to restricted share issuance 
our sales support and marketing headcount increased by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal product development 
product development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
the most significant development efforts in fiscal related to an updated version progress openedge  the introduction of datadirect xquery and updated versions of the sonic and real time product lines 
the dollar increase was primarily due to expenses related to the development teams associated with the recently acquired persistence and apama products and the start up of our offshore development center in india 
there were no capitalized software development costs in fiscal due to the timing and stage of development of projects that might otherwise qualify for capitalization under our software capitalization policy 
capitalized software costs associated with progress openedge totaled million in fiscal as compared to none in fiscal our product development headcount increased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  human resources  legal  information systems and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
the dollar increase was primarily due to headcount related costs  transition and integration costs associated with acquisitions  higher professional services fees and the impact of changes in exchange rates 
our administrative headcount increased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal amortization of other acquired intangibles 
amortization of other acquired intangibles primarily represents the amortization of value assigned to intangible assets obtained in business combinations other than assets identified as purchased technology 
amortization of other acquired intangibles increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of apama and easyask and the full year impact of the acquisition of persistence 
compensation expense from repurchase of subsidiary stock options 
compensation expense from repurchase of subsidiary stock options in fiscal consisted of costs of million related to the settlement and pay out to sonic employees who held vested  in the money options to purchase sonic common stock 
acquisition related expenses 
acquisition related expenses for fiscal totaling million include expenses of million for retention bonuses to apama and easyask employees who joined us  of which million is attributable to sales and marketing  million is attributable to product development  and million is attributable to general and administrative 
these costs were partially offset by a credit of million for settlement of pre acquisition assets and liabilities related to a previous acquisition 
acquisition related expenses for fiscal include in process research and development from the acquisition of datadirect of million  which was expensed when the acquisition was consummated because the technological feasibility of several products under development at the time of the acquisition had not been achieved and no alternate future uses had been established 
the value of in process research and development was determined based on an appraisal from an independent third 
table of contents party 
there was no in process research and development associated with the apama or easyask acquisitions in fiscal income from operations 
income from operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of total revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal noncash charges for amortization of purchased intangibles and in process research and development decreased from of total revenue in fiscal to of total revenue in fiscal if we are able to meet our forecasted revenue target and expenses occur as planned in fiscal  we expect income from operations as a percentage of revenue to be between and for fiscal other income 
other income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily related to an increase in interest income 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and short term investment balances  partially offset by foreign exchange hedging and transaction expenses 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the irs completed an examination of our united states income tax returns for fiscal years through the provision for taxes in fiscal includes a tax benefit of million resulting from the reversal of accruals for estimated income tax liabilities that were no longer required 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to this benefit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
our total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal total revenue would have increased by approximately if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal total revenue from the progress openedge product line increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue derived from the sonic product line increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue from the real time product line increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue from the datadirect product line  which was acquired in the december acquisition of datadirect technologies  contributed million of revenue in fiscal software license revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software license revenue would have increased by approximately if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the increase in software license revenue was positively affected by the addition of datadirect  which accounted for of software license revenue in fiscal software license revenue from indirect channels  including application partners and oems  and from sales to direct end users  both increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal software license revenue from the progress openedge product set increased year over year  primarily within the database products 
software license revenue also increased from newer products such as the sonic and real time product lines 
maintenance and services revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal maintenance and services revenue would have increased by approximately if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the increase in maintenance and services revenue was also the result of growth in our installed customer base  renewal of maintenance agreements and the acquisition of datadirect  partially offset by a decline in professional services revenue 
the decline in professional services revenue was primarily the result of a continued decrease in consulting revenue in the emea region as a result of economic conditions and a slower overall market for professional services 
total revenue generated in markets outside north america increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal revenue from the three major regions outside of north america  consisting of emea  latin america and asia pacific  each increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue generated in markets outside 
table of contents north america would have represented of total revenue if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of business derived from international operations in fiscal is primarily the result of the addition of datadirect 
the customer base for datadirect is more concentrated within north america 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of software license revenue from to 
the dollar increase was primarily due to higher royalty expense for products and technologies licensed from third parties

other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income  resulting from lower interest rates and the reduction in cash and short term investment balances due to the acquisition of datadirect 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due to a change in expected rates for state taxes on deferred taxes and lower benefits from tax exempt interest 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and short term investments totaled million at november  the increase of million from the end of fiscal was due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from exercises of stock options and stock issuances under our stock purchase plan  partially offset by cash used for the acquisitions of apama and easyask  stock repurchases and purchases of property and equipment 
in fiscal years  and  we generated million  million and million  respectively  in cash from operations 
the increase in cash generated from operations in each year was primarily due to higher net income 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was also due to increases in deferred revenue  primarily the result of increased billings for maintenance

the amount for fiscal included the purchase of a building adjacent to our headquarters for million 
the remaining amounts in fiscal and in each of fiscal years and consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and building and leasehold improvements 
we financed these purchases primarily from cash generated from operations  except with respect to the building purchase which included the required assumption of an existing mortgage

we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our licensing agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to our product license agreements  we will indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
other agreements with our customers provide indemnification for claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by us or our subcontractors 
historically  our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been insignificant 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is immaterial 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in connection with the purchase of a building adjacent to our headquarters in fiscal  we were required to assume long term debt of million 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  debt payments  potential cash acquisitions and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months

sfas r requires a company to measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees in exchange for services and recognize that cost over the period that such services are performed 
in april  the sec announced that the sfas r effective transition date will be extended to the annual period beginning after june  we adopted sfas r on december  using the modified prospective transition method 
adoption of sfas r will materially increase our stock compensation expense and decrease our net income and basic and diluted earnings per share 
however  adoption of sfas r will have no impact on our financial position 
for fiscal  total stock based compensation expense  including amounts from the issuance of restricted shares in fiscal and amounts from stock options using the fair value provisions of sfas r  is estimated to be approximately million 
in order to develop the fiscal stock based compensation expense estimate  we utilized assumptions  including  among other items  projected option grants  expected life and volatility  which were similar to the amounts in fiscal sfas r also requires that the excess tax benefits related to stock compensation be reported as a cash inflow from financing activities rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified all or our debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
we enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge certain transactions of selected foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we base our accounting policies for these contracts on the designation of the contracts as hedging instruments 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and matching of derivative instruments to the underlying transactions 
we generally recognize market value increases and decreases on the foreign exchange option and forward contracts in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
we operate in certain countries where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
there were no outstanding foreign exchange option contracts at november  in december  we entered into foreign exchange option contracts with a notional value of million 
we also hedge net intercompany balances 
we generally do not hedge the net assets of our international subsidiaries 
the foreign exchange exposure from a movement of currency exchange rates on our financial position is not significant 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  our revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and our net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from our ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
