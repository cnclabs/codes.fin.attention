any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  based on historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions  judgments and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements recognition of cost of forwarding the billing of cost of forwarding is usually delayed 
as a result  we must estimate the cost of purchased transportation and services  and accrue an amount on a load by load basis in a manner that is consistent with revenue recognition 
such estimate is based on past trends  and on the judgment of management 
historically  upon completion of the payment cycle receipt and payment of transportation bills  the actual aggregate transportation costs are not materially different than the accrual 
however  in any case in which the actual cost varies significantly from the accrual  a revision to the accrual would be required 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statement of income in each period in which the allowance is increased 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  then we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on our current financial projections  we currently believe that we will realize of our deferred tax assets 
valuing long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets purchased  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
factors that we consider when evaluating for possible impairment include the following o significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and o significant negative economic trends 
when determining whether the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill is impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors  we determine the existence of impairment by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to expected future cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair values 
as of december   goodwill totaled approximately million  other intangible assets amounted to approximately  and our long lived assets  consisting primarily of net property  plant and equipment  totaled  as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are to be tested at least annually for impairment 
this pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization slightly increased approximately from  in to  in the increase was mainly due to additional computer hardware and software were purchased for the implementation of new logistics system and office renovation at airgate 
amortization arises from an intangible customer relationship asset recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of airgate on april  we recorded this asset at the cost of  and are amortizing it on a straight line basis over a period of five years 
during and  the amortization expense attributable to this asset was  with the acquisition of paradigm international inc on april   we recorded an intangible customer relationship asset of  same as airgate  the cost of the intangible customer relationship asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years 
in   was expensed as amortization 
non operating income and expenses interest and other income interest and other income increased from  in to  in increase in interest income was due to increase in amount received from pledged bank deposits as a result of longer term to maturity and rise in interest rate during second half of interest expense interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in short term working capital financing and the rise in interest rate during preferred stock dividend and amortization of issuance cost during april and may  the company sold to two institutional investors  stated amount of its series a preferred stock and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for  shares and per share for  shares

unlike other us logistics companies  the company bears a significant amount of inventory risk 
we pay for the guarantees we put up to the carriers  even if we do not have any customer cargo to fill the space 
we are not able to ask our clients to make these guarantees and  accordingly  we assume all of the risks 
the company has freight forwarders liability insurance that covers it against claims from clients 
we take responsibility for the cargo  and we are responsible for its safe delivery 
therefore  we can be held responsible and incur losses if anything goes wrong 
changes in governmental deregulation efforts  regulations governing the company s products  and or the international trade and tariff environment could all effect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
management believes the company s business has not been significantly or adversely effected by inflation in the past 
historically  the company has generally been successful in passing cost increases to its customers by means of price increases 
however  competitive market place conditions could impede the company s ability to pass on future cost increases to customers and could erode the company s operating margins 
the company continues to assess and improve financial controls  and has negotiated successfully with its banks to get credit facilities for future financial needs 
additional risks and uncertainties include o governmental deregulation efforts  regulations governing the company s products and or the international trade and tariff environment adversely effecting our ability to provide services to customers 
o competitive marketplace conditions impeding the ability of the company to pass future cost increases to customers 
o dependence of the company on international trade resulting from favorable worldwide economic conditions 
o dependence of the company on retention and addition of significant customers 
o the ability to recruit and retain skilled employees in a tight labor market 
o the ability of the company to develop and implement information systems to keep pace with the increasing complexity and growth of the company s business 
o the trend of the increasing price of oil has led airlines to charge additional fuel surcharges and pass on their added cost on to shippers and consignees  increasing the company s shipping costs  that  in turn  results in a reduction in our customers shipping incentive and increasing our rate of order cancellation  o the world health organization received reports of the deadly hn avian influenza virus in various countries with some cases being reported of human infection with the hn avian influenza virus 
as the deadly hn virus can be carried by migratory birds and could spread globally  the company s operations could be adversely effected by avian influenza if a human outbreak occurs 
liquidity and capital resources we used approximately   and  of cash from operating activities in  and  respectively 
this decrease in the use of cash was mainly attributable to less amounts used in accounts and other receivables 
net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we used  to acquire plant and equipment to improve our office facilities  and used  for the acquisition of subsidiaries 
we received payment of a loan receivable in the amount of  and we received  from the disposal of property and equipment 
we also received  for the deposit refund from two potential equity investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  in  and respectively 
during  we repaid a short term debt to bank of  and also made principal payment under capital lease obligations of  we received  net of financing costs  from the laurus transaction 
subsequently   was repaid on the revolving note 
with our lockbox arrangement with laurus our restricted cash increased  net proceeds from other short term borrowings was  we received  from the exercise of stock options and  was used to repurchase treasury stock of the company 
working capital was  inclusive of restricted cash of approximately million and  as of december  and december  respectively 
we believe that we will be able to rely on cash flow from operations for short term liquidity  and also believe that we have adequate liquidity to satisfy our material commitments for the twelve months following december  we also believe that we can obtain additional liquidity through further negotiation of short term loans from banks to satisfy our short term funding needs  if any 
we intend to continue our expansion plans through a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions 
future acquisitions will focus on companies that serve as freight forwarders in key markets or offer services such as customs brokerage that complement our existing services 
we intend to achieve organic growth through the establishment of new branch offices in latin america  joint ventures in the prc and through a major marketing campaign through the indian subcontinent  including india  sri lanka and bangladesh 
in order to achieve this goal  we will be required to raise a certain amount of capital 
to a certain extent  these activities will have a significant impact on both liquidity and capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitment we have entered into various contractual obligations  which may be summarized as follows payments due by period total less than years years thereafter contractual obligations year capital lease obligations    operating leases     cargo space commitments   series a preferred stock and    cumulative dividends we have capital lease obligations of  as of december   of which  is repayable within one year  and  is repayable after one year 
we also entered into various lease commitments for office premises and warehouses in the united states  hong kong and china 
the total outstanding lease commitments under non cancelable operating leases are  as of december  as of december   the current portion of these commitments of  is payable within one year 
we have entered into written agreements with various sea and airfreight carriers committing to take up a guaranteed minimum amount of cargo space each year 
as of december   the amount outstanding for such commitments to be entered in was approximately million 
as of december   our commercial commitments may be summarized as follows total amounts amount of expiration other commercial commitments committed commitment per period less than year years overdraft   invoice trust receipt   guarantees by bank   revolving notes   minimum borrowing notes    net of discounts of  payable minority   shareholder as of december   to finance our working capital  our available banking facilities were approximately  obtained from creditworthy commercial banks in hong kong 
as of that date  the total amount of bank credit facilities utilized was  this was made up of i  of overdrafts  ii  of invoice trust receipts 
moreover  we have a borrowing facility with laurus master fund ltd  subject to certain requirements 
the total available amount of the credit facility is million 
as of december   the total amount outstanding for the credit facility  net of discount is  which is comprised of  on the revolving note and  on the minimum borrowing note 
while the banks are not obligated to advance any further funds to us  we believe that absent any significant downtrend in business  these sources of credit will continue to be available to us 
outlook we believe the following factors may have a positive impact on our future results of operation and our financial conditions china s increased exports according to the research reports issued by hsbc china  seventeenth edition  second quarter and hang seng bank limited hang seng economic monthly  april edition  china s economy began to accelerate in with gdp growth of over being achieved from to the first quarter of  with the government targeted to achieve economic growth of for the reports also state that china s foreign trade reached a record us  billion in with export rising due to partially the weakening of the renminbi rmb and the trade liberalization following the wto entry 
since china s entry into the wto  overseas manufacturers have accelerated the relocation of their production facilities to china 
providing trading rights to foreign and private companies  which were phased in during the three years after wto accession  has also made it more convenient for non state enterprises to export or source product in china 
the share of exports by foreign invested companies rose by from in to in while exports by domestic private companies surpassed those of state owned enterprises in japan  the usa  the eu and the hong kong sar are china s major export markets  which together accounted for over of the country s total exports 
exports to the foregoing destinations  in terms of the dollar amount  has increased from us billion in to us billion  an increase of nearly 
as a result  the rising trading power of china has been especially important for transportation companies 
with extensive operational centers based in hong kong and south china  management believes the company is well positioned to take advantage of this rapid growth in trade closer economic partnership we have updated our research on the effects of cpea since it became operational  and certain of the following information was extracted from the trade and industry department  the government of hksar press release the cepa benefits hong kong economy on january  the closer economic partnership arrangement cepa that was signed on june   originally focused on stimulating and enhancing hong kong s economic recovery 
after that  six annexes to cepa main text  supplement to cepa cepa ii and supplement ii to cepa cepa iii were subsequently signed on september   october  and october  respectively 
in theory  cepa significantly lowers the barriers for hong kong enterprises to tap the mainland china market 
now in its third year of operation  cepa fostered closer economic co operation between the mainland and hong kong and contributed to the long term economic development in both places 
under the cepa  hong kong companies are permitted to set up wholly owned enterprises in mainland china to provide logistics services and related consultancy services for ordinary road freight  and to engage in the management and operation of logistics services through electronic means 
it permits freight forwarding agents to operate in mainland china on a wholly owned basis a full two years ahead of china s wto entrance timetable  and will permit such agents to enjoy national treatment in respect of the minimum registered capital requirement 
cepa iii  signed in october  just came into effect on january   provides tariff free access for all products of hong kong origin except prohibited articles imported into the mainland upon applications by local manufacturers and upon cepa rules of origin being met and agreed upon 
on trade in services  taking the three phases of cepa together  the mainland has agreed to provide preferential treatment to hong kong service suppliers in service areas 
twenty three liberalization measures spread across service areas  including distribution and transport  became effective on january  under cepa iii 
in reviewing its operation in the past two years  cepa has been implemented smoothly since its inception 
more than  applications for certificate of origin under cepa co cepa  with a total export value exceeding hk billion around us million have been issued 
the products concerned range from textiles and clothing and foods to pharmaceutical  plastics and plastics products 
the amount of co cepa issued and the value of cepa exports in both recorded more than a increase compared with after a wide range of products including food and beverages were granted zero tariff preference under cepa ii 
through our hong kong based agi logistics hk ltd  shenzhen careship transportation limited  as well as agi china ltd  we believe we can enjoy first mover advantage  that is  we believe that our hong kong based subsidiaries can benefit from cepa because we have experience in doing business in  and we believe that we are knowledgeable in the prc regulations and business practices 
we believe that our existing offices in hong kong and mainland china can also respond quicker than other us freight forwarders to ongoing developments in china 
outsourcing of non core activities companies are increasingly outsourcing freight forwarding  warehousing and other supply chain activities so that they may focus on their respective core competencies 
companies are increasingly turning to freight forwarders  and logistics and supply chain management providers  to manage their purchase orders and assure timely delivery of products at a lower cost and at greater efficiency than if the function was undertaken directly 
globalization of trade as barriers to international trade are gradually reduced  international trade will similarly increase 
in addition  companies are increasingly sourcing for supplies and raw materials from the most competitive suppliers throughout the world 
this form of sourcing would generally also lead to increased volumes of trade 
increased need for time definite delivery the demand for just in time and other time definite delivery has increased as a result of the globalization of manufacturing  greater implementation of demand driven supply chains  the shortening of product cycles and the increasing value of individual shipments 
companies are decreasing the number of freight forwarders and supply chain management providers with which they interact so that they might work providers who are more familiar with their requirements  processes and procedures  and who can function as long term partners 
as such  freight forwarders that are globally integrated and are able to provide a full complement of services  including pick up and delivery  shipment via air  sea and land  warehousing and distribution and customs brokerage  are well positioned to gain from this shift 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of its business 
these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates 
the potential impact of the company s exposure to these risks is presented below foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies 
the company s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency  which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred 
this brings a market risk to the company s earnings 
foreign exchange rates sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
as one of the major subsidiaries uses the hong kong dollar hkd  which has been linked to the us dollar at a rate of hk to us  as its functional currency  there has been no material change in the company s foreign exchange risk exposure 
however  if hkd was unlinked to the us dollar  an average weakening of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately  an average strengthening of the us dollar  for the same period  would have had the effect of reducing operating income by approximately  the company currently does not utilize any the derivate financial instruments or hedging transactions to manage foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk the company does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  and short term borrowings of  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would have an insignificant impact on the company s earnings 
in management s view  there has been no material change in company s market risk exposure between and
