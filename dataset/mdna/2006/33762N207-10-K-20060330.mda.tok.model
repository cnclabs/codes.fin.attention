critical accounting policies the company believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and related interpretations 
revenue from software product licenses other than ticketing and fan memberships described below is recognized upon shipment of the product when the company has a signed contract  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable

in accordance with paragraph of sop  license revenues under the per user model are recognized under the company s revenue recognition polices when revenue recognition criteria are met 
hosting services are priced as a monthly or yearly fixed amount based upon number of users  and are recognized ratably by month over the period of service 
hosting services revenues are consolidated into services revenues on the company s financial statements 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
our software product is able to function independently in a customer s environment without additional services 
our training  implementation  and customization services are optional services to our customers and are not necessary for the functioning of the software product 
our software is offered as a stand alone product 
it can be implemented with minimal services 
the essential functionality of the software  such as database support and maintenance  preparation of marketing campaigns  and standard workflow  is functional and can be utilized by the customer upon installation as intended by the customer 
at a customer s request  the software can also be implemented with additional services  such as data conversion and workflow modifications  which are not significant to the functionality of the software  but rather tailor features to most effectively function in the customer s environment 
the revenue for the customization or implementation services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
revenue is allocated to software and services based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair values 
because the software is a stand alone product that can be used for the customer s purpose upon installation  and because any services performed have insignificant effect on the functionality of the software  services revenues are accounted for separately in accordance with paragraph of sop the company has not recorded any unbilled receivables related to implementation and customization service revenues  and the company has accounted for any implementation and customization service revenues that have been billed as the services were performed  in accordance with paragraphs and of sop the company has arrangements with customers that provide for the delivery of multiple elements  including software licenses and services

vendor specific objective evidence is based on standard pricing for each of the elements in our multiple element arrangements 
revenue associated with the various elements of multiple element arrangements is based on such vendor specific objective evidence as the price charged for each element is the same as when the element would be sold separately from any other element 
standard pricing does not vary by customer or by duration  or by requirements of the arrangement 
maintenance revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the maintenance agreements 
advanced billings for services and maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet  with revenue recognized as the services are performed and on a pro rata basis over the term of the maintenance agreements

software development costs capitalized software development costs consist principally of salaries  contract services  and certain other expenses related to development and modifications of software products capitalized in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of such costs begins only upon establishment of technological feasibility as defined in sfas and ends when the resulting product is available for sale 
the company evaluates the establishment of technological feasibility based on the existence of a working model of the software product 
capitalized costs may include costs related to product enhancements resulting in new features and increased functionality as well as writing the code in a new programming language 
all costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software products are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
the company evaluates the realizability of unamortized capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date 
software development costs which are capitalized are subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
if the unamortized capitalized software cost exceeds the net realizable value of the asset  the amount would be written off accordingly 
the net realizable value of the capitalized software development costs is the estimated future gross revenues of the software product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
amortization of capitalized software costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is not more than three years 
it is possible that those estimates of anticipated product revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or both could be reduced due to changing technologies 
the amortization of software development costs is presented as a cost of software revenue in the company s financial statements

the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
goodwill was evaluated for impairment quarterly throughout and in accordance with sfas no 
the fair value was estimated using the expected net present value of future cash flows 
the analysis for the fourth quarter of and then the third quarter of  identified lower than expected operating results  and the company revised the anticipated future earnings projections at the end of each quarter 
as a result of these reviews  it was determined that there was an impairment of goodwill  and the second phase was required 
the second phase resulted in the company recording non cash impairment charges of  at december  and  at september  to write off a portion of the carrying value of goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
currently  the company maintains its cash position primarily in money market funds and other bank accounts 
the company does not currently engage in hedging activities or otherwise use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its financial assets 
although a decrease in interest rates could reduce our interest income  management does not believe a change in interest rates will materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations in changes in interest rates could make it more costly to borrow money in the future and may impede our future acquisition and growth strategies if management determines that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
we do not engage in any hedging activities 
as foreign currency exchange rates vary  the fluctuations in revenues and expenses related to our international customers may impact the financial statements 
a weaker us dollar would result in an increase to revenues and expenses and a stronger us dollar would result in a decrease to revenues and expenses
