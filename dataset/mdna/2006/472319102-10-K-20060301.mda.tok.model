we will not update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results can and will differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our management believes our critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are our valuation methodologies applied to investments  certain securities positions and otc derivatives and our use of estimates related to compensation and benefits 
fair value of financial instruments investments are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by management 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  reported net asset values  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 
furthermore  judgment is used to value certain securities eg  private securities  a securities  less liquid securities if quoted current market prices are not available 
these valuations are made with consideration for various assumptions  including time value  yield curve  volatility factors  liquidity  market prices on comparable securities and other factors 
the subjectivity involved in this process makes these valuations inherently less reliable 
table of contents than quoted market prices 
we believe that our comprehensive risk management policies and procedures serve to monitor the appropriateness of the assumptions used 
the use of different assumptions  however  could produce materially different estimates of fair value 
fair value of derivatives fair values of exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices 
otc derivatives are valued using valuation models 
the valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our otc derivatives require inputs including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs 
the selection of a model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
where possible  we compare and verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available 
for otc derivatives that trade in less liquid markets  model selection and inputs requires more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in the market 
as markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available  we continue to review and refine the models that we use 
at the inception of an otc derivative contract day one  we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
if we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions  we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and  consequently  record no day one gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
subsequent to the transaction date  we recognize trading profits deferred at inception of the derivative transaction in the period in which the valuation of such instrument becomes observable 
compensation and benefits the use of estimates is important in determining compensation and benefits expenses for interim and year end periods 
a substantial portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses  which are fixed at year end 
in addition to the level of net revenues  our overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets  revenue mix and our use of equity based compensation programs 
we believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated annual discretionary bonuses among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned 
consequently  we have generally accrued interim compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios 
our fourth quarter reflects the difference between the compensation and benefits we determine at year end and the accruals recorded through the end of the third quarter 
subsequent events debt issuance year senior debentures in january  we sold in a registered public offering million aggregate principal amount of our unsecured year senior debentures due january  massachusetts mutual life insurance company in february  massachusetts mutual life insurance company massmutual purchased in a private placement million of our series a convertible preferred stock

business segments for presentation purposes  the remainder of results of operations is presented on a detailed product and expense basis rather than a business segment basis 
our earnings are subject to wide fluctuations since many factors over which we have little or no control  particularly the overall volume of trading  the volatility and general level of market prices  and the number and size of investment banking transactions may significantly affect our operations

effects of changes in foreign currency rates we maintain a foreign securities business in our foreign offices london  paris  tokyo and zurich as well as in some of our domestic offices 
most of these activities are hedged by related foreign currency liabilities or by forward exchange contracts 
however  we are still subject to some foreign currency risk 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 
effects of inflation based on today s modest inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  securities and receivables  we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation 
the rate of inflation  however  can affect various expenses  including employee compensation  communications and technology and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us 
risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities market  credit  operational  legal and compliance and new business 
risk management is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and 
table of contents business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices and the correlation among them  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
commodity price risks result from exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities  commodity baskets and commodity indices 
we make dealer markets in equity securities  debt securities and commodities 
to facilitate customer order flow  we may be required to own equity and debt securities in our trading and inventory accounts 
we attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short position 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by us fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we follow industry practices to reduce credit risk related to various trading  investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
liabilities to other brokers and dealers related to unsettled transactions ie  securities failed to receive are recorded at the amount for which the securities were purchased  and are paid upon receipt of the securities from other brokers or dealers 
in the case of aged securities failed to receive  we may purchase the underlying security in the market and seek reimbursement for losses from the counterparty in accordance with standard industry practices 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
in addition  the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be 
table of contents required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
legal and compliance risk 
legal and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  anti money laundering and record keeping 
we also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate actions by us or by our employees or agents 
new business risk 
new business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product 
by entering a new line of business or offering a new product  we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face 
we review proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities 
other risk 
other risks encountered by us include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups 
recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued a revision to fasb no 
 fasb no 
r  share based payments 
fasb no 
r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
fasb no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
on april   the us securities and exchange commission announced new rules that require companies to implement fasb no 
r by the start of their fiscal year beginning after june  among other requirements  fasb no 
r generally requires the immediate expensing of equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees 
the adoption of fasb no 
r on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 fasb no 

fasb no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
fasb no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fasb no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  eitf 
eitf presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership  and should therefore consolidate a limited partnership  unless the limited partners have the substantive ability to remove the general partner without cause based on a simple majority vote or can otherwise dissolve the limited partnership  or unless the limited partners have substantive participating rights over decision making 
this guidance became effective upon ratification by the fasb on june  for all newly formed limited partnerships and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified 
for all other limited partnerships  the guidance is effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  management is currently evaluating the effect of adoption of eitf on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include inventory position and exposure limits  on a gross and net basis  
table of contents scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and risk limits based on a summary measure of risk exposure referred to as value at risk var 
value at risk in general  value at risk measures potential loss of trading revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon 
we calculate value at risk over a one day holding period measured at a confidence level which implies the potential loss of daily trading revenue is expected to be at least as large as the value at risk amount on one out of every twenty trading days 
value at risk is one measurement of potential loss in trading revenues that may result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
as with all measures of value at risk  our estimate has substantial limitations due to our reliance on historical performance  which is not necessarily a predictor of the future 
consequently  this value at risk estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions using a historical simulation approach 
the aggregated var presented here is less than the sum of the individual components ie  interest rate risk  equity risk  currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk due to the benefit of diversification among the risk classes 
diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregated var and the sum of vars for the four risk categories 
the following table illustrates the var for each component of market risk 
daily var in millions value at risk in trading portfolios year ending december  at december  risk categories average high low interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect firmwide var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specific confidence level 
for the var numbers reported above  a one day time horizon and confidence level were used 
equals the difference between firmwide var and the sum of the vars by risk categories 
this effect is due to the market categories not being perfectly correlated 
we continue to enhance our var methodology as the diversification of our products expands 
therefore  certain reclassifications and adjustments to prior period information have been incorporated into our var methodology and are reflected in the table set forth above 

table of contents the following table presents our daily var over the last four quarters daily var trend line graph var back testing the comparison of daily revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the efficacy of the var model 
back testing is performed at various levels of the trading portfolio  from the holding company level down to specific business lines 
a back testing exception occurs when the daily loss exceeds the daily var estimate 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated five outliers when comparing the one day var with the back testing profit and loss in an efficient model for the one day  var should not have more than twelve out of back testing exceptions on an annual basis 
back testing profit and loss is a subset of actual trading revenue and includes only the profit and loss effects relevant to the var model  excluding fees  commissions  certain provisions and any trading subsequent to the previous night s positions 
it is appropriate to compare this measure with var for back testing purposes because var assesses only the potential change in position value due to overnight movements in financial market variables such as prices  interest rates and volatilities 
the graph below illustrates the relationship between daily back testing profit and loss and daily var for us in backtesting and var estimates line graph var is a model that predicts the future risk based on historical data 
we could incur losses greater than the reported var because the historical market prices and rates changes may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions 
in addition  the var model measures the risk of a current static position over a day horizon and might not predict the future position 
when comparing our value at risk numbers to those of other firms  it is important to remember that different methodologies could produce significantly different results 

table of contents daily trading net revenue in millions trading revenue used in the histogram below titled vs distribution of daily trading revenue is the actual daily trading revenue  which includes not only back testing profit and loss but also fees  commissions  certain provisions and the profit and loss effects associated with any trading subsequent to the previous night s positions 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily trading revenue for substantially all of our trading activities 
daily trading revenue bar graph maturity data at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding  with fixed interest rates 
we entered into a fair value hedge with no ineffectiveness using interest rate swaps in order to convert million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due march  into floating rates based upon libor 
the effective interest rate on the million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes  after giving effect to the swaps  is 
the fair value of the mark to market of the swaps was positive million as of december   which was recorded as an increase in the book value of the debt and an increase in other assets
