table of contents critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company is in the business of performing drug testing and reporting the results thereof 
the company s drug testing services include training for collection of samples and storage of positive samples for its customers for an agreed upon fee per unit tested of samples 
the revenues are recognized when the predominant deliverable  drug testing  is provided and reported to the customer 
the company also provides expert testimony  when and if necessary  to support the test results  which is generally billed separately and recognized as the services are provided 
in  the company adopted emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which was effective for all transactions entered into subsequent to june  the company applied the consensus reached under eitf and concluded that the testing  training and storage elements are considered one unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes as the training and storage costs are de minimis and do not have stand alone value to the customer 
the company has concluded that the predominant deliverable in the arrangement is the testing of the units and has recognized revenue as that service is performed and reported to the customer 
deferred revenue represents payments received in advance of the performance of drug testing procedures 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the underlying test results are delivered 
with respect to a portion of these transactions  there may be instances where the customer ultimately does not require performance referred to as breakage 
realized gain is then recognized as other income when the company can reasonably  reliably and objectively determine that an estimated amount of breakage has occurred 
breakage is deemed to occur only at the point it becomes remote that performance will be required for an estimable portion of transactions 
the company has not recorded any gain related to breakage in  or the company continues to monitor this to determine whether breakage can be reasonably  reliably and objectively determined 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  including bad debts and income taxes  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of its customer accounts 
management reviews its accounts receivable aging for doubtful accounts and specifically identifies accounts that may not be collectible 
the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers 
table of contents and  as a consequence  believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
the company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area 
bad debt expense has been within management s expectations 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the company to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
a deferred tax valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company had net deferred tax assets in the amount of  at december   which the company believes are fully realizable based upon expected future taxable income  which the company s believes is reasonably attainable in light of previous operating results during the past three years 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits may involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company has provided for its estimated taxes payable in the accompanying financial statements 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
