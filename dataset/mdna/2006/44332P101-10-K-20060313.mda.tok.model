introduction the following will be discussed and analyzed overview of business results of operations cash flow  liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations shareholders equity market risk goodwill and intangible assets related party transactions off balance sheet transactions critical accounting policies and estimates effects of recent accounting pronouncements overview of business hub international is one of the leading insurance brokers in north america  providing a broad array of property and casualty  life and health  employee benefits and risk management products and services 
we focus on both commercial and personal accounts in the united states and canada  which we serve through our approximately  employees in nearly offices  using a variety of retail and wholesale distribution channels 
since our company was formed in through the merger of canadian insurance brokerages  we have acquired an additional brokerages and have established a strong presence in the northeastern  midwestern and western united states and in the canadian provinces of ontario  quebec and british columbia 
we have grown our revenue from million in to million in  with of the increase being attributable to acquisitions 
during the three years ended december   we acquired brokerages in the united states and another seven brokerages in canada 
of these acquisitions  six were hubs  all based in the united states 
united states revenue has grown to of our total revenue primarily as a result of acquisitions and organic growth 
organic growth is similar to the same store sales calculation used by retailers 
it includes revenue growth from units included in our financial statements for at least months 
because we apply the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  acquired brokerages financial results are included only from the date of acquisition 
we have a diverse mix of products  services  insurer relationships and distribution channels  and as a result  our revenue and profitability levels are not usually highly susceptible to major changes related to a single product or service 
however  general economic trends may influence overall insurance rates  commissions and availability or costs of individual types of coverage  which in turn may affect our revenue and profitability levels 
our ability to hub international limited annual report december  
table of contents achieve organic revenue growth is not solely dependent on rising or declining rates  but results from a more complex mixture of general economic growth and demand  access to coverage from insurers and our marketing and sales performance 
our business is comprised of two geographic segments  the united states and canada 
the mix of products and services we offer in the united states differs from those we offer in canada 
in the united states in  of our commission income was generated from the sale of commercial lines and from personal lines 
in canada in  of our commission income was generated from the sale of commercial lines and from personal lines 
our purchase of a major personal lines insurance broker in is expected to increase the percentage of us commission income derived from personal lines to approximately in commission income  which usually ranges from to of the premium charged by insurers  provides approximately of our revenue base 
in addition to these core commissions  the company derives revenue from volume overrides additional compensation based on the overall volume of business a brokerage places with the insurance company see contractual obligations other for information regarding our legal proceedings contingent commissions additional compensation based on the profit the insurance company makes on the book of business a brokerage places with the insurance company see contractual obligations other for information regarding our legal proceedings and other income comprised primarily of premium finance fees  fees charged to clients in lieu of commissions and interest income  including income earned while we hold client premiums on behalf of insurance companies 
we operate through an organizational structure comprised of our head office  larger regional or specialty brokerages that we call hub brokerages and smaller brokerages managed by the regional hubs 
our head office implements the acquisition of hub brokerages and oversees the acquisition of smaller  fold in brokerages by the hubs 
our head office also coordinates selling and marketing efforts  identifies cross selling opportunities among our brokerages  and handles certain general administrative functions 
at december   we had hub brokerages ten in the united states and five in canada 
each hub addresses a specific regional or specialty market  operating with its own management team and structure  business plan and operating benchmarks 
regional hubs are generally larger than million in annual revenue  while a hub that focuses on a specialty product line or market might have a smaller revenue base 
each hub brokerage is responsible for not only the development of its own business  but also the identification  acquisition and integration of smaller  fold in brokerages 
fold in acquisitions allow each hub brokerage an opportunity to strengthen its market position by acquiring new or complementary products and services and management talent 
fold in acquisitions also provide the opportunity for improved profit margins through the reduction or elimination of redundant administrative functions  facilities and systems 
our structure enables our hub brokerages to more effectively and quickly meet the changing needs of our clients in various markets  while benefiting from the operating efficiencies and leverage of a large brokerage 
we seek to operate largely on a decentralized basis  believing that the best operating decisions are made close to the customer 
at the same time  we recognize that our growth has created demand for increased coordination by our head office 
in and  we invested more in the coordination of additional functions from our head office to enhance cross selling  international collaboration  marketing efficiencies  total expense management and financial control initiatives 
as a general operating guideline  we work to centralize those activities that do not touch the customer directly  while adopting a more decentralized approach for functions that connect directly with customers 
during the two years after september  premium rates remained firm for most types of coverage  rising to per year in many cases 
during the latter part of  the canadian market remained firm  but the us market experienced some softening of premium rates for property and casualty coverage 
during insurance rates in both canada and in the us  for many types of coverage  declined 
in  in both canada and the us we saw average declines in premiums in the range of three to five percent 
as a result of the hurricane annual report december  hub international limited 
table of contents season  property rates for coastal areas in will increase 
however  we anticipate all other areas of north america to see modest decreases in rates in the range of two to three percent 
we do not have a significant client base in the coastal areas 
for us  as for other brokers  falling rates can present both positive and negative effects 
falling premiums usually yield reduced commissions  if the insurance buyer maintains its coverage levels 
however  many insurance buyers will respond to falling rates by increasing total coverage  often by lowering deductibles  increasing limits of coverage  or by adding new risks to those already insured 
during  we started to see more evidence of insurance buyers increasing coverage levels as a result of the softening of insurance rates 
for we expect a slower pace of rate reductions as the year unfolds 
we also anticipate that contingent commissions could decline this year due to loss experience for insurers in in addition  the economic environment could lead to higher or lower sales and employee headcounts at client companies  leading in turn to increased or reduced demand for employee benefits  liability and other types of coverage tied to business activity levels 
because we are a service organization  compensation and other personnel costs make up the largest component of total expenses in property and equipment are comprised primarily of furniture  computer systems and office equipment 
therefore  our capital resources  including external borrowings  internally generated cash flow and proceeds from the issuance of common shares  are devoted primarily toward acquisitions 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue as a result of acquisitions and organic growth  which includes the strengthening of the canadian dollar as compared to the us dollar in  we reported a increase in revenue to million in during  we acquired insurance brokerages  including personal lines insurance brokerage  inc pli from the chubb corporation on october   and divested of three offices in the united states and canada

table of contents organic growth figures include the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the us and canadian dollars 
in  the rise of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar contributed three percentage points of our organic growth rate in total revenue 
in addition to the variations that can result from changes in organic growth rates  acquisitions and other variables related to operations  both and results included a number of factors that can complicate direct comparisons

the contingent payment to talbot management is recorded by us as a charge to earnings over the period the payments are earned because it is a compensation based arrangement and specifically a performance award 
the management of talbot was and is to be compensated for future services based on achieving certain performance targets during each of the months ending december    and see contractual obligations acquisitions 
severance costs relate to a specific cost reduction program that was implemented during the third quarter  in an effort to reduce compensation expense to targeted levels 
these severance costs were in addition to regular recurring severance costs which we may incur in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  we benefited from the gain on forgiveness of debt of million  after tax  as part of a settlement of an early payment of a term loan 
included in was the write off of trademarks of million after tax associated with the name change of certain of our regional brokerages 
we further benefited from the gain on disposition of assets of certain brokerages of million  after tax  as compared to a gain of million in gains and losses on disposition of assets are not an unusual item  but they are included here to highlight the difference between the two reporting periods 
similarly  changes in currency exchange rates are not an unusual item 
because we derive our revenue from both the united states and canada  foreign exchange fluctuations will continue to impact our results 
we have highlighted the impact of these changes because currency translation effects can lead to reported results that are less meaningful than local currency results as an indicator of underlying operations

as part of this corporate consolidation and identity development program  we have reassigned a number of key executives to new or expanded areas of responsibility and determined that future marketing and communications will be conducted under the hub international name  rather than the traditional corporate names of acquired brokerages

this amount combined with available lines of credit leaves us with a total amount of million available for acquisitions compared to the million available at december  it is impossible to define exactly how many acquisitions or how much new revenue could be acquired through the use of this cash  additional cash flow from operations and application of credit facilities  as acquisition pricing and other factors vary during the course of the year 
however  we intend to use our common shares as partial consideration for any hub acquisition  and generally have paid a multiple of times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization frequently referred to as ebitda  which is a non gaap measure for acquired brokerages 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash  funds generated from operations and borrowings available under credit facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s financial requirements  excluding some acquisitions  during the next twelve months 
we may finance acquisitions with available cash or an existing credit facility  but may  depending on the number and size of future acquisitions  need to supplement our finance requirements with the proceeds from debt financing  the issuance of additional equity securities  or a combination of both 
in november  a universal shelf registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the public offering and sale  from time to time  of an aggregate of up to million of debt and or equity securities  was declared effective 
the net proceeds from the sale of such securities could be used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and to meet working capital needs

as of december  we were in compliance with all financial covenants governing the senior notes

the effect of the swap is to convert the fixed rate interest payments of senior notes and senior notes in amounts of million and million  respectively  to a floating rate resulting in a savings of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we account for the swap transaction using the synthetic instruments method under which the net interest expense on the swap and associated debt is reported in earnings as if it were a single  synthetic  financial instrument 
as at december   we estimated the fair value of the swap to be million  which is not recognized in our financial statements 
accordingly  million is the estimated amount that we would need to pay to terminate the swap as of december  during the first quarter an early payment settlement was negotiated in respect of our million loan from an insurance carrier 
the loan agreement provided for an incentive agreement whereby a credit could be earned to reduce interest payments based on target premiums placed with the carrier and principal amounts based on target premiums placed with the carrier as well as loss ratios on those premiums 
the early settlement negotiations resulted in the million principal amount of the term loan being reduced to million and interest payments for the first quarter being reduced to zero

we estimate the march  payment to be approximately million 
the contingent payment to talbot management is recorded by us as a charge to earnings over the period in which the payments are earned because it is a compensation based arrangement and specifically a performance award 
the management of talbot was and is to be compensated for future services based on achieving certain performance target during each of the months ending december   and we estimate that the aggregate value of compensation which will be recognized under this arrangement will be approximately million of which million and million were recognized in and  respectively 
at december   million of compensation relating to the talbot acquisition was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in connection with other various acquisitions completed through december   we may be obligated to pay contingent consideration up to a maximum sum of approximately million in cash and million in common shares based upon management s best estimate of acquired brokerages achieving certain targets 
the contingent payments are payable on various dates through july according to the terms and conditions of each purchase agreement 
any additional consideration will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill once the contingency is resolved 
in connection with contingent consideration earned as at december   the financial statements reflect a liability to pay cash of million as of december  other as previously disclosed  the insurance brokerage industry in general and certain of our subsidiaries in particular have been the subject of ongoing investigations by state attorneys general and insurance regulators regarding contingent commissions and other practices

exchange rate sensitivity we report our revenue in us dollars 
our canadian operations earn revenue and incur expenses in canadian dollars 
given our significant canadian dollar revenue  we are sensitive to the fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
foreign currency exchange risk is the potential for loss in revenue and net income as a result of a decline in the us dollar value of canadian dollar revenue due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded in the cumulative translation account cta  a balance sheet account  and does not currently impact net earnings 
the canadian dollar is subject to volatility  and has experienced significant changes in its value compared to the us dollar during through at december  and one us dollar equaled and canadian dollars  respectively 
the table below summarizes the effect that a decline or increase in the value of the canadian dollar would have had on our revenue  net earnings and cta for the twelve months ended december   and in millions of us dollars  except percentages revenue net earnings cta the increasing proportion of our revenue derived from our us operations and earned in us dollars has  in part  offset the potential risk of a decline in the canadian dollar

goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets arising from acquisitions consist of the following in thousands of us dollars customer relationships non competition covenants goodwill accumulated amortization total we completed our impairment testing on the balance of goodwill and intangible assets as of january   and based on the testing performed  no impairment losses were incurred 
the amounts allocated to customer relationships were determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows from commissions with consideration given to remaining economic lives  renewals  and associated expenses 
the amounts allocated to non competition covenants were determined using an income approach with consideration given to economic benefits associated with having the covenants in place versus damages that would ensue absent the agreements 
the balance of the excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
customer relationships are generally amortized over their estimated economic useful life  typically ten to fifteen years 
many factors outside our control determine the persistency of our customer relationships and we cannot be sure that the value we have allocated will ultimately be realized 
non competition covenants are intangible assets that have an indefinite life and accordingly  are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment 
when an employee leaves hub  the non competition covenant becomes effective and the value assigned is then amortized over the life hub international limited annual report december

under this method  we report in earnings the net interest expense on the swap and associated debt as if it were a single  synthetic  financial instrument

we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with canadian gaap 
our significant accounting polices are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require our management to make significant estimates and judgments  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts and policies  our observance of trends in the insurance industry  information provided by our clients and information provided by outside sources  as appropriate  and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our critical accounting policies include the recognition of commission income  the allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition  the measurement of goodwill and other intangibles and related impairment evaluation  the valuation of stock based compensation  the measurement of income tax liabilities and recoverability of future tax assets  and the measurement of contingent liabilities and self insured liabilities 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit committee of our board of directors 
these policies are discussed below 
recognition of commission income we recognize commission income and fees as of the effective date of our client s policy unless information is not available relating to the determination of their policy premiums  in which case we recognize commission income and fees related to that policy when that information becomes available and the revenue can be reasonably determined 
the term effective date means the date from which protection is afforded under an insurance policy 
at the effective date  we become entitled to the commission because the insurance coverage has been placed with the underwriter and the premium is owed by the client 
on the effective date our work has been substantially completed and the related costs to produce  market and place the coverage have been incurred 
we generally bill in the month of the effective date 
as such  the amount of the commission related to the services provided has been determined and the premium is receivable as of that date 
accordingly  on the policy effective date the earnings process is complete and the services which we have been contracted to perform have been provided 
this is in accordance with the criteria set forth in sab and sab as an insurance brokerage we generally have two types of commissions direct billed commissions and agency billed commissions 
with direct bill  the insured is billed by the underwriter directly 
the underwriter collects directly from the insured 
we are then paid for our brokerage services generally commission income directly by the underwriter 
accordingly  we do not bill or collect fees directly from the insured 
commission income for direct billed commissions is recognized on the policy effective date 
the other type of commission income is agency billed commission 
in these arrangements we bill the insured directly  normally on or before the effective date of the policy 
premiums collected are remitted net of commission income to the insurance carriers 
hub international limited annual report december  
table of contents we maintain an allowance for estimated policy cancellations and commission returns based upon the application of historical policy cancellation and commission return rates to the current year revenue  adjusted for any known items 
adjustments to the allowance for policy cancellations are recorded in commission revenue on our consolidated statements of earnings 
the allowance for estimated policy cancellations is based on our management s judgment  and is regularly evaluated by management by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of policies  trends in actual and forecasted policy cancellations  and current economic conditions that may affect the likelihood of client policy changes or cancellations 
if our actual policy cancellation rates are significantly different from our historical policy cancellation rates  and those changes have not been adjusted for in the allowance  our actual commission income may be significantly different from what we estimated 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that estimates uncollectible receivables based on the length of time receivables are past due and the financial health of specific customers 
adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling  occupancy and administration expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings 
if our actual doubtful accounts are significantly different than what we estimated  and those changes have not been adjusted for in the allowance  our results may be significantly different from what we estimated 
allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition the acquisition of new brokerages is a fundamental component of our strategy 
when we acquire a business  the cost of the purchase is allocated to all of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
any additional contingent consideration is recorded as an adjustment to goodwill once the contingency is resolved 
for significant acquisitions  we engage qualified third party valuators to assist us in conducting asset valuations 
the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  and liabilities may be determined using a number of valuation methods including net realizable values  market prices and discounted cash flows 
the use of assumptions and estimates is inherent in each of these valuation methods 
valuation methods and their underlying assumptions and estimates are based on management s judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates  or assumptions could produce different allocations of the purchase price and  as a result  different results of operations 
for acquisitions where part of the consideration paid has the character of compensation rather than purchase price  primarily for talbot  we account for such payment as an expense 
where such compensation is stock based  our accounting policy for stock based compensation is followed 
the fair value of such compensation is a significant estimate 
the use of different estimates could produce results that are significantly different than our results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets primarily represent goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchase of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we do  however  test these assets at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit may be determined using a number of market valuation methods 
to determine fair value we apply a market multiple to adjusted earnings for each reporting unit 
the use of assumptions and estimates is inherent in each of these valuation techniques 
the valuation method and the underlying assumptions and estimates are based on management s judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates and assumptions could produce different results in the application of the impairment tests and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
the cost of definite lived intangible assets is amortized over the estimated remaining economic useful life of the assets 
we regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangibles  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
the estimated useful life of customer relationships is generally ten to fifteen years 
the estimation of the useful economic lives and the selection of estimates and assumptions used in conducting impairment tests require annual report december  hub international limited 
table of contents the exercise of judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates and assumptions could produce different results in the application of the impairment tests of the assets and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation includes stock options  restricted shares and restricted share units rsus 
our accounting policy is to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation as an expense over the period in which entitlement to the compensation vests 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make assumptions in relation to the expected term of the stock option  volatility in the price of the underlying common shares  interest rates and dividend yield 
the fair value model is particularly sensitive to the changes in the price and price volatility of our common shares 
the assumptions used are based on our management s judgment and the use of different judgments  estimates  and assumptions could produce significantly different results of fair value of the stock options and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
we estimate the fair value of rsus granted at the fair market value on the date of grant 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with canadian gaap which requires that future tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
futures taxes are recognized using tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
future tax assets are required to be reduced by valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax asset will not be realized 
we record valuation allowances to reduce future tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are not more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowance  we consider projected future as well as historical taxable income  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in our judgments about the reliability of future tax assets in future years  we would adjust the related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding charge or credit to income 
we record an estimated income tax liability based on our best judgment of the amounts likely to be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax liabilities ultimately paid are dependent on a number of factors  including the filing of tax returns and the resolution of tax audits  and may differ from the amounts recorded 
tax liabilities are adjusted through income when it becomes probable that the actual liability differs from the amount recorded 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and judgments  our results of operations could be significantly different than reported 
our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially impacted by these estimates and judgments 
contingent liabilities and self insured liabilities in the normal course of business  we are subject to various claims and lawsuits consisting primarily of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance 
based on canadian gaap  which is consistent with fas no 
accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on the assessment of whether the risk is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and is estimatable 
management s assessment may be developed in consultation with the company s professional advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
this assessment requires management to make estimates and apply judgment to estimate the cost to settle these claims and lawsuits and to estimate the probability of loss contingencies actually occurring 
we are self insured for certain losses related to errors or omission claims  certain general insurance deductibles and a portion of our group medical insurance 
the amounts in excess of self insured levels are fully insured by third hub international limited annual report december  
table of contents parties  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
we utilize third party actuaries to assist in the valuation of certain of these liabilities 
we accrue an estimated liability for these self insured losses  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  based on known claims and past claims history  as well as an estimate for known claims 
reserves for self insurance at december  were approximately million and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and valuations to determine the adequacy of our self insured reserves 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish these reserves over the past two years 
uncertainty is associated with our self insured liabilities because management must make estimates and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and incurred but not reported claims as of our balance sheet date 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and judgments our results of operations could be significantly different than reported results
