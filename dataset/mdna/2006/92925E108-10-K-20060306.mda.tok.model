item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
set forth below is a description of the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  and our discussion begins with an overview of the significant factors that have recently affected our company  including a discussion of industry market trends and management s perspectives regarding the opportunities and challenges we face during and beyond 
next  we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years 
a summary follows of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to an understanding of our management s discussion and analysis and our consolidated financial statements  as well as a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
finally  we review our cash flows and liquidity  capital resources and contractual commitments 
the following discussion includes various forward looking statements about the markets in which we operate  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
for information about some of the risks that could cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements  please refer to the section entitled item business factors that may affect future results and accuracy of forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview of our products and services we provide drilling related products and services and completion and workover related products and services to major and independent oil and natural gas companies  drilling contractors and other oilfield service companies 
the majority of our revenues are generated from charging our customers day rates  based on the number of days our products and services are used 
we also sell certain products used in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas and receive revenues from our customers in connection with these sales 
our primary expenses are salaries for our personnel and the costs associated with expendable parts and supplies  research and development  repair and maintenance of equipment and costs of products sold as well as general operational costs 
a detailed description of the products and services that we provide  the manner in which we market these products and services and the way in which we charge our customers for these products and services is contained under item business businesses 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of other factors 
any prolonged increase or decrease in oil and natural gas prices affects the levels of exploration  development and production activity as well as the entire health of the oil and natural gas industry 
demand for our drilling related products and services is directly affected by the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our completion and workover related products and services depends more on oil and natural gas production activity  which is less immediately affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
drilling related products and services revenue from our drilling related products and services segment constituted approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
approximately of our drilling segment revenue for was generated in the united states  including the gulf of mexico 
the remaining was generated in various international locations 
in july  exploration and development activity levels in the united states peaked and subsequently began to decline primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices 
this decline continued through april  at which point the united states drilling rig count levels reached a low of  which was comprised of offshore rigs and land rigs 
as natural gas prices climbed and remained relatively strong  rig count levels 
table of contents began to recover in and continued through this increase  however  resulted entirely from an increase in land based rigs 
according to statistics published by baker hughes  the average number of rotary rigs operating in the united states was   and  for  and  respectively 
of these figures  land rigs comprised   and  respectively  and offshore rigs comprised  and  respectively  for the same periods 
the offshore rig count did improve modestly in the fourth quarter of and into early  but has since retreated to activity levels not experienced since mid whether this trend will continue beyond is unclear at this time 
we do believe that the overall outlook for domestic natural gas exploration and development activity remains positive  as natural gas production has yet to respond to the higher level of natural gas prices and higher rig counts 
this factor should keep upward pressure on natural gas prices 
despite the divergence between onshore and offshore activity levels  the recovery in exploration and development activity levels in the united states has positively impacted our revenue  cash flow and earnings generated in this market 
outside of the united states  the north sea remains our largest drilling segment market 
according to statistics published by baker hughes  the number of rotary rigs operating in the north sea declined from an average of in january to a low of in february  before recovering to an average of in december we expect no significant change in activity levels in the north sea in the near term 
as the primary area of improvement in drilling activity in the united states has been onshore  the importance of improving our market share for land based services became critical 
in october  in response to this developing trend  we made the strategic decision to enter the directional drilling business in north america 
as a result of this decision and the growth in the united states land rig count  we have successfully leveraged our new directional drilling business to effect an increase in the utilization of our measurement while drilling tools and down hole drilling motor fleet 
the increased utilization of our measurement while drilling tools and down hole drilling motor fleet has helped to offset the sluggish nature of united states offshore activity 
however  our logging while drilling revenues from this market have outperformed the rig count numbers as a result of performing more jobs with a higher content of our services  improving prices and an increase in our share of this market 
a key challenge that our drilling related products and services segment faces is the demand by our customers for more efficient and technologically advanced services and tools 
we have invested substantial time and capital into developing and commercializing technologies that are of value to our customers and that enable us to compete effectively with the major integrated oilfield service companies 
during the third quarter of  we began to market our pathmaker dimensional rotary steerable technology 
we expect commercialization of the dimensional rotary steerable technology to improve the utilization of our logging while drilling  measurement while drilling and directional drilling services  as our customers are increasingly requiring this type of technology as a prerequisite for a drilling project or contract 
we are currently developing a pathmaker dimensional rotary steerable tool and are offering this tool on a limited commercial basis during the first quarter of introduced on a commercial basis in late  our array wave resistivity technology is the first of our next generation of logging while drilling tools 
we believe that our array wave resistivity tools provide a more robust and accurate resistivity measurement 
tools and data analysis in this technology improve the precision and reliability of formation data obtained through the analysis of electromagnetic wave transmissions through the formation surrounding a well bore 
our array wave resistivity tools are also designed to withstand high pressure  psi and high temperature f well conditions 
for a discussion of other technologies we have under development  please read item business research and development technology initiatives 
completion and workover related products and services our completion and workover related products and services segment provided approximately of our total consolidated revenue for revenues provided by this segment are almost entirely derived from the 
table of contents united states and the gulf of mexico 
while revenues from this segment are affected by the level of oil and natural gas prices  activity in this segment is only modestly affected by drilling activity see the discussion under drilling related products and services above 
as a result  our completion and workover segment has provided stability during prolonged downturns in drilling activity 
we have increased our revenue capacity in this segment through capital spending in  and  which  when combined with our acquisitions and strategic land based expansion efforts  has strengthened and further diversified the operations of the company 
continued growth in this segment will be dependent upon  among other factors  industry activity levels  prices of oil and natural gas  our capital expenditure program and our ability to attract and retain qualified service personnel and field engineers required to operate the specialized equipment used in this business 
geographic expansion we are currently working to establish a larger presence in the rocky mountain region of the united states  an expansion that will require an initial capital investment of approximately million see item business strategy 
discontinued operations in march  we committed to the divestiture of our maintenance and safety related products and services segment 
accordingly  this segment has been included in our selected financial data and our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for fiscal years ended on or before december  as discontinued operations 
in april  we completed the sale of well safe  inc  one of the two companies that formerly comprised our maintenance and safety related products and services segment  for cash consideration of million 
additionally  in december  we sold charles holston  inc  the remaining entity that formerly comprised this segment  for consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and a million subordinated promissory note due december  we sold well safe and charles holston pursuant to customary stock purchase agreements in which we made customary representations and warranties  agreed to customary covenants and agreed to indemnify the buyers of these businesses for certain matters  subject to certain caps  limitations and deductibles 
these sales resulted in a loss of million for the year ended december  recent development adverse weather conditions 
our results of operations were negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita and the associated shut in of drilling and production activity in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
the adverse impact began during the third quarter of and has continued into the first quarter of results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for certain of our products and services  combined with the benefit of increased revenue capacity from our capital expenditures 
revenues from our drilling related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute the increase in revenues in this segment to a increase in the average number of rotary rigs operating in the united states  resulting in an increase in demand for our products and services  
table of contents an increase in our gulf of mexico market share  resulting from higher utilization of our existing logging while drilling tools and commercialization of certain of our new technologies discussed earlier  and revenue capacity increases from our capital expenditure program 
revenues from our completion and workover related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year december  we attribute the increase in revenues in this segment to the benefits experienced from our onshore geographic expansion  higher utilization of our tools and services as a result of the overall increase in activity levels  and revenue capacity increases from our capital expenditure program 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to improved pricing  improved utilization and a change in our revenue mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs related to expansion efforts within all of our business lines 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  warehouse fire related costs 
on april   a houston warehouse facility operated by one of our subsidiaries was destroyed by a fire 
for the year ended december   we reported million in costs associated with this fire  net of approximately million in anticipated insurance reimbursements 
this amount has been reflected in our selected financial data and our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income under the caption warehouse fire related costs and in footnote operating segments as a reduction to operating income for the drilling segment for the year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased research and development spending on our pathfinder energy services technologies  including our pathmaker dimensional rotary steerable tool  our slim density neutron stand off caliper tool and other research and development initiatives 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was largely the result of a larger depreciable asset base resulting from our capital expenditures 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to our write off  during the second quarter of  of million in deferred financing costs associated with the retirement of our previous credit facility during june of and a larger amount of debt in  partially offset by higher interest costs associated with rising interest rates and our recognition of approximately million in net losses in as increases to interest expense resulting from net payments to the swap counterparties discussed more fully under capital resources 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective rate compared to was due to several factors including  but not limited to  changes in valuation allowances in 
table of contents various jurisdictions  ongoing and settled audits in foreign jurisdictions  and fluctuations in income across taxing jurisdictions with different tax rates 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increases in capacity driven by capital expenditures  higher demand for certain of our products and services  particularly drilling completion fluids  land based measurement while drilling and directional drilling services  cased hole wireline and coiled tubing  as well as the revenue contributions of hydracoil  inc  dutch  inc 
and continental directional corp  which were acquired in the fourth quarter revenues from our drilling related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in capacity driven by capital expenditures  the growth of our north american directional drilling business  enhanced by the increase in land based drilling activity levels in the united states  increased demand for our drilling fluids and rental tool products and the impact of the acquisitions that we consummated during the fourth quarter of revenues from our completion and workover related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increases in capacity driven by capital expenditures  higher utilization of our coiled tubing and cased hole wireline fleet  demand for our completion fluids and the impact of the acquisitions that we consummated during the fourth quarter of cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was due to increased insurance costs and our revenue mix 
in particular  our revenue mix was affected by sales increases in our lower margin fluids products and land based directional drilling services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the operating expenses associated with the businesses we acquired in the fourth quarter of and during  as well as increased personnel costs related to expansion efforts within our directional drilling business and corporate compliance initiatives as mandated by law 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at for the year ended december  relative to the year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased research and development spending on our pathfinder energy services technologies  including our pathmaker dimensional rotary steerable tool  our array wave resistivity tool and other research and development initiatives 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of depreciation associated with our continued capital expenditures  as well as additional depreciation and amortization due to our acquisitions 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year december  this increase was primarily due to the million write off of non cash financing costs related to our previous credit facility  offset by a reduction in our effective interest rate during the second half of 
table of contents provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and was 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant areas involving management judgment and estimates are described below 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
in the event we were to determine that a customer may not be able to make required payments  we would increase the allowance through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
in certain cases where projected results indicate that realization is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carry forwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
insurance reserves we are subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
although we maintain policies of insurance that cover claims asserted against our company  many of our policies provide for large deductibles 
in addition  our insurance policies may not cover certain types of claims 
we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on the 
table of contents coverages we maintain and our assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible  or probable 
while we make these judgments with the advice of legal counsel and our insurers  these judgments are inherently subjective 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation 
however  accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
fair value is typically determined by an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
if any of these or other indicators occur  we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment 
several of these indicators are beyond our control  and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
in addition  determination of future cash flows requires us to make judgments and estimates based upon the most recent market and operating data for the applicable asset at the time the estimate is made  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if indicators arise 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows but are also based on other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas in march  the sec issued staff bulletin no 
regarding its interpretation of sfas r 
under sfas r and sab  we must expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
we adopted sfas r as of january  using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized based 
table of contents on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after january  and on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on january  for the year ending december   we estimate that the cost relating to this pronouncement for unvested share based payments granted prior to january  will be approximately million  or per share 
our compensation committee may award additional stock options during which would increase the amount of this expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses for cash are working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  acquisitions  business expansions and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash reserves  cash generated by operations and amounts available to be drawn under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent our cash requirements exceed our sources of liquidity  we will be required to fund our cash requirements through other means  such as through debt and equity financing activities or we will be required to curtail our expenditures 
cash flow working capital was million as of december  and million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in working capital and cash flow from operating activities was principally attributable to higher operating levels across our business segments 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of capital expenditures  offset by lost in hole proceeds which represent funds we receive from a customer when one of our tools is involuntarily damaged or lost down hole 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  changes in net cash related to financing activities were primarily the result of borrowings and repayments under our credit facility  which is described below  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of million  primarily for rental tool inventory  logging while drilling and measurement while drilling tools  wireline equipment and coil tubing units  including expenditures for the replacement of equipment lost in hole 
in addition  we incurred million in research and development expenditures for the year ended december  acquisitions during  we consummated one acquisition in the completion and workover segment for total consideration of approximately million  including cash of approximately million and  shares of our common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
capital resources we maintain a revolving credit facility with certain lenders to provide for our cash  liquidity and other borrowing needs 
our credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million and matures on may  as of december   we had an outstanding loan balance of million and approximately million in letters of credit issued under our credit facility  resulting in an available borrowing capacity on such date of approximately million 
amounts borrowed under our credit facility bear interest  at our election  at either a variable rate equal to libor  plus a margin ranging from to depending upon our leverage ratio  or an alternate base rate equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  plus a margin ranging from zero to depending upon our leverage ratio 
as of december   we had elected to pay interest on our outstanding borrowings at libor plus the then applicable margin of 
table of contents our credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our property and assets  a pledge of all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of not greater than of the capital stock of each of our top tier foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries 
our credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  and a specified net worth 
our credit facility limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make  the amount of debt we may incur outside of the credit facility  the amount of future investments we may make  our ability to pay dividends and our ability to engage in certain business combination transactions 
our credit facility contains customary events of default  including payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to certain other indebtedness agreements in excess of specified amounts  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgments in excess of specified amounts  erisa defaults  certain failures of guaranty or security documents supporting our credit facility to be in full force and effect and a change of control 
we entered into our credit facility in june we entered into a first amendment to our credit facility in may and a second amendment in february financing costs associated with our original credit facility of approximately million and financing costs associated with the first amendment of approximately million will be ratably amortized to interest expense over the five year term of the credit facility 
as a result of the approximate million repayment of our previous credit facility in june  we wrote off approximately million in non cash financing costs to interest expense during the second quarter of this amount represented financing costs that previously had been deferred 
the descriptions of our credit facility  as amended by the first amendment and second amendment  are qualified in their entirety by reference to the original credit facility which is filed as exhibit to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   the first amendment which is filed as exhibit a to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  and the second amendment which is filed herewith as exhibit b 
on may   we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million related to our credit facility 
under these agreements  we receive payments from the swap counterparties based on a floating rate equal to three month libor plus the applicable spread under our credit facility  and we make payments to such counterparties based on a fixed interest rate of per annum plus the applicable spread under our credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table aggregates information about our contractual cash obligations in thousands as of december  payments due by period more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations represent orders to purchase various equipment and inventory items that have not yet been delivered 
future capital requirements we anticipate that acquisitions of complementary companies  assets and product lines will continue to play an important role in our business strategy 
while there are currently no unannounced agreements or 
table of contents ongoing negotiations for the acquisition of any material businesses or assets  such transactions can be effected quickly and may occur at any time 
likewise  we will continue to need to make capital expenditures for tools and equipment and to make research and development expenditures to maintain and improve the quality of our products and services 
we currently estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately million in and will make research and development expenditures of approximately million in we believe that our internally generated cash flow  combined with access to our credit facility will be sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements necessary to fund our operating  capital expenditure  research and development and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
however  our ability to maintain our credit facility and the sufficiency of our internally generated cash flow can be impacted by economic conditions outside of our control 
the continuation of our acquisition strategy will require substantial capital 
we currently intend to finance future acquisitions through issuances of our equity or debt securities and through borrowings under our credit facility 
using debt to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility and using stock could dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders 
the extent to which we will be able or are willing to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to grow through acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases on real property and automobile leases discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk could arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize  derivative and other financial instruments to manage these market risks 
we have not entered into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million related to our credit facility 
under these agreements  we receive interest at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus the applicable spread under our credit facility and pay interest at a fixed rate of plus the applicable spread under our credit facility 
assuming our current level of borrowings and considering the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  a basis point increase in the interest rate we pay under our credit facility would have increased our interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange risk 
our earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we currently do not hedge against foreign currency translation risks and we believe that foreign currency exchange risk is unlikely to be significant to our operations 
stock price volatility 
our ability to raise capital at a reasonable cost of capital is  in part  affected by the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors including variations in our earnings  variations in oil and natural gas prices  the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  our customers  investor perceptions of us and other oilfield service companies and the liquidity of the market for our common stock
