item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of historical financial statements we have restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and  all the quarters therein and the first three quarters of fiscal year the restatements are primarily the result of a the incorrect determination of operating and reportable segments and reporting units related to the application of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
 which also had the effect of changing the charges recorded for the assets sold as part of our plan initiated in december to sell a number of businesses  and the net book value of assets held for sale on our balance sheet 
b errors identified in revenue recognition of preneed cemetery merchandise and services contracts and recognition of realized trust earnings on preneed cemetery and funeral merchandise and services contracts 
c other miscellaneous adjustments  including adjustments for lease related accounting practices 
the restatement for these errors is discussed in more detail below 
segments and reporting units we re evaluated our application of fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 and determined that we had incorrectly identified our operating and reportable segments for all prior periods 
we concluded that we had eleven operating and reportable segments  which consisted of a corporate trust management segment and a funeral and cemetery segment for each of five geographic areas central  western  eastern  southern florida and all other 
our historical presentation of segment data had consisted of two operating and reportable segments  funeral and cemetery 
as part of our strategic planning process discussed in business strategy in item  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reorganized and revised our operating divisions from four to two and revised our operating and reportable segments 
for further discussion of the revision of our operating and reportable segments in the fourth quarter of  see 
table of contents note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the correction of our operating segments had the related effect of requiring changes in our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment reviews under sfas no 
 retroactive to the november  adoption date of sfas no 
our evaluation of goodwill should have been performed to include reporting units as opposed to the two reporting units historically identified 
as a result of the reorganization and revision of our divisions effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we revised our evaluation of goodwill based upon reporting units 
for further discussion of the change in our reporting units in the fourth quarter of  see note g 
the restatement of our operating segments and reporting units resulted in the need to correct our goodwill impairment reviews as of november  the date we adopted sfas no 
and as of october   and consequently  we recorded a million million after tax  or per diluted share charge on november  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the adoption of sfas no 
our previously reported financial statements did not include a goodwill impairment charge upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
on november  or during our annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we also restated our previously reported fiscal year goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax  or 
per share because based on our revised reporting units  no goodwill impairment charge for the year ended october  was necessary 
further  the restatement of goodwill on our balance sheet had the effect of changing the net book value of the assets we sold as part of our plan to sell a number of our businesses and the net book value of assets held for sale on our balance sheet 
due to these changes and changes in the classification of certain businesses between continuing operations and discontinued operations  the gain or loss on those sales has been re evaluated and restated 
in  this resulted in an additional net gain of million  representing a gain of million related to continuing operations as originally reported and a gain of million related to discontinued operations 
in  this resulted in an additional net gain of million  representing a loss of million related to continuing operations as originally reported and a gain of million related to discontinued operations 
deferred revenue project in connection with our internal control assessment under section of sarbanes oxley  we undertook a project the deferred revenue project in to verify the balances in deferred preneed cemetery revenue and deferred preneed funeral revenue by reviewing substantially all of the preneed cemetery and funeral service and merchandise contracts included in our backlog 
this process involved the review of nearly  preneed contracts 
the deferred revenue project resulted in our assessment that deferred revenue was misstated and therefore we needed to restate our prior period financial statements for fiscal years through  including the quarters therein  and the first three quarters of the adjustment impacted the cumulative effect of adopting sab no 
on november   and reported revenues and earnings for fiscal years through and the first three quarters of we identified errors in the amount of recorded revenue  deferred revenue and related deferred trust earnings associated with cemetery merchandise and funeral service and merchandise contracts 
the errors also resulted in restatements to the amount of preneed selling costs recorded upon the adoption of sab no 
 and in subsequent years and also the charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to preneed selling costs adopted effective november  see note f and a to the consolidated financial statements included in item the overall impact of the deferred revenue project on net earnings and earnings per share for the first three quarters of and fiscal years   and was a decrease in net earnings of million including million  or 
per share  related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for preneed selling costs  million  million  million and million  respectively  and a decrease in earnings per share of    
and  respectively 
the amount reflects the adjustment to the previously reported unaudited results through july  the deferred revenue project also resulted in changes to our consolidated balance sheet as described in footnote to the selected financial data table included in item and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item other adjustments 
table of contents as previously disclosed in our form q for the second quarter of fiscal year  we reviewed our lease related accounting practices and determined that certain adjustments related to rent escalations and leasehold improvement amortization were necessary 
the cumulative effect of these adjustments for all prior periods amounted to a charge of million million after tax  or 
per share 
we evaluated the materiality of these operating lease adjustments on our financial statements and concluded that the impact of these adjustments was not material 
as a result  we recorded the cumulative effect of these prior period adjustments of million as non cash charges to funeral and cemetery costs in the second quarter of fiscal year because we are amending our form k for the year ended october  for the restatements discussed above under the heading restatement of financial statements  we are now required to record the lease adjustments in the periods they were actually incurred 
in this filing  we removed the cumulative effect of this prior period adjustment of million million after tax and will remove it from subsequent amended form q filings for january   april  and july  we also recorded other immaterial miscellaneous adjustments 
the information included in results of operations below reflects the restated amounts 
a summary of the effects of these restatements on our financial statements can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item overview of fiscal year we are the third largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust fund earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings and finance charges 
results of operations for fiscal year  we had a net loss of million compared to net earnings of million for fiscal year contributing to the net loss was a charge of million for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the change in our method of accounting for preneed selling costs  implemented effective november  fiscal year earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased by million to million  compared to million for fiscal year contributing to the decline were charges for the loss on early extinguishment of debt of million related to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and our percent senior subordinated notes 
also contributing to the decline was a million increase in funeral costs  of which million was due to the change in accounting for preneed selling costs and the remainder was due primarily to increased health insurance costs 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million due primarily to increased professional fees associated with our defense of the class action litigation  the section internal controls review process  the deferred revenue project and additional audit related services 
we also recorded a million charge for net hurricane related costs 
further discussion of the hurricanes affecting us during fiscal year can be found below in the section entitled hurricanes 
in addition  cemetery revenues declined million primarily due to a decrease in revenue associated with the construction of cemetery projects  a decrease in earned finance charges  a decrease in revenue due to hurricane katrina and an increase in bad debt resulting from the impact of hurricane katrina 
partially offsetting these declines  interest expense decreased by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  reflecting the results of the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and percent senior subordinated notes at lower rates and a million decrease in average debt outstanding 
as of october  we had achieved our lowest net debt level in nine years 
in addition  funeral revenue increased million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year primarily due to increased same store funeral call growth of percent and an increase in average revenue per call of percent 
same store results include the three funeral homes impacted by hurricane katrina 
excluding these funeral homes  same store funeral call growth increased percent 
we believe that the increase in funeral calls reflects the implementation of our strategic plan beginning in july  and can also be attributed to our funeral home incentive compensation plan implemented during the first quarter of fiscal year management 
table of contents believes this increase is a significant accomplishment given that this is the first year since that we have experienced positive year over year call growth 
for fiscal year  we achieved a percent increase in preneed funeral sales  which was in line with our goal of percent to percent for for fiscal year  we achieved a percent increase in preneed funeral sales  which was in line with our goal of percent to percent for for fiscal year  we achieved a percent increase in cemetery property sales  which was in line with our goal of percent to percent for for fiscal year  we achieved a percent increase in cemetery property sales  which was below our stated goal of percent to percent  due in part to the effects of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
debt refinancing on november   we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt of million million after tax  or 
per share to write off fees associated with the previous credit facility 
on february   we completed the private offering of million principal amount of our percent senior notes due we also borrowed million in additional term loan debt under our senior secured credit facility 
we used the net proceeds from these transactions  together with a portion of our available cash  to repurchase million in aggregate principal amount of our percent senior subordinated notes due and to pay related tender premiums  fees  expenses and accrued interest of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt of million million after tax  or 
per share representing the bond tender premium  related fees and expenses and the write off of unamortized fees 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the remaining percent senior subordinated notes were redeemed 
we recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt of million representing the call premium and write off of remaining unamortized fees on the percent senior subordinated notes 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item dividends and stock repurchase plan in march  our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of two and one half cents per share of common stock 
a total of million in dividends was paid on april   july  and october  although we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future  the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance see forward looking statements included herein and item a 
risk factors 
on march   we announced a new stock repurchase program  authorizing the investment of up to million in the repurchase of our common stock 
on march   we completed our initial stock repurchase program  having repurchased  shares since its inception 
since the inception of the new stock repurchase program through october   we have repurchased  shares of our class a common stock at an average price of per share 
at current stock prices  the use of our cash to pay dividends  repurchase stock  reduce debt and construct funeral homes on our cemeteries or those of unaffiliated third parties continues to be more attractive than acquisitions 
however  if acquisition pricing improves  we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions may again be a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy important synergies and economies of scale from our infrastructure 
strategic plan in july  we began to implement a new strategic plan 
for a description of the plan  see business strategy in item business 
as a result of the strategic planning process  in july  we named a new chief operating officer and announced that we were reorganizing our operating divisions from four to two eastern and western  effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year these changes are a result of our recent strategic planning process 
for the year ended october   we incurred million in charges related to this reorganization  and expect to benefit from annual pre tax cost savings of between million and million see forward looking statements included here and item a 
risk factors 
hurricanes on monday  august   hurricane katrina struck the new orleans metropolitan area and the mississippi and alabama gulf coasts 
our executive offices and shared services center are located in a building 
table of contents we own in the new orleans metropolitan area  and no significant damage occurred to that building 
for the month of september  we temporarily housed most of the shared services center functions  such as cash receipts and disbursements  customer service  contract processing and information technology in orlando  florida  in newly leased and existing company office space  and temporarily housed other functions such as the executive offices  treasury  accounting  trust administration  human resources  training  communications  marketing  tax and compliance in the dallas  texas area in newly leased office space 
of our funeral homes and cemeteries  three funeral homes and five cemeteries  which represent approximately four percent of our annual revenues and approximately five percent of our annual gross profit  are located in the new orleans metropolitan area  have suffered substantial damage and are conducting business in temporary facilities until repairs are completed 
our mausoleum construction and sales business  acme mausoleum  which primarily operates in southwest louisiana and texas  was also negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
including acme mausoleum  the new orleans area funeral home and cemetery operations represent approximately six percent of our annual revenue and gross profit 
the book value of net property and equipment  receivables  inventory and cemetery property at the affected properties amounted to approximately million prior to the storms 
as of october   and  total revenues of these facilities amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma also interrupted business in florida  alabama  mississippi and texas primarily due to evacuations and power outages 
we have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incurred due to damage caused by hurricane katrina 
as of october   we had incurred approximately million in expenses related to hurricane katrina including the write off of damaged buildings  equipment and inventory  demolition costs  debris removal  record restoration  general cleanup  temporary living facilities for employees  relocation expenses and other costs 
we expect to receive insurance proceeds of at least million currently based on the status of our insurance review  million of which had been received as of october  we believe that a significant portion of the remainder of the loss we experienced may be covered by insurance 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item forecasts for a discussion of our forecasts for continuing operations in fiscal year and the principal assumptions underlying the forecasts  see the discussion under the heading forward looking statements below 
preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes i  j  k  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery services and merchandise backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this represents the face value of the backlog plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the estimated build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue  was approximately billion 
trust portfolio 
table of contents we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
because a portion of the funds we receive from preneed sales are deposited into the trusts and invested in a variety of debt and equity securities and other investments  the performance of the trusts investments can affect our current and future revenue streams 
from through  we achieved an overall annual realized return of percent to percent in our domestic trusts 
however  the average realized return on our domestic trusts was percent  percent  percent  percent  percent and percent for fiscal years     and  respectively 
these returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
for fiscal year  including realized and unrealized gains and losses  we achieved a percent return on our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust and a percent return on our perpetual care trust 
for the last three years  including realized and unrealized gains and losses  our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts achieved a total return of percent  and our perpetual care trust achieved a total return of percent 
we recognize earnings and losses realized by preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts based on delivery of underlying products and services 
we recognize all earnings and losses realized by our cemetery perpetual care trusts currently  including capital gains and losses in those jurisdictions where capital gains can be withdrawn and used for cemetery maintenance 
as a result  depressed stock prices and low returns on fixed income investments put pressure on perpetual care trust earnings recognized in fiscal year and may do so again in fiscal year because approximately percent of our total trust portfolio is currently invested in a diversified group of equity securities  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to improve if the performance of the overall stock market improves  but we would also expect its performance to deteriorate over time if the overall stock market declines 
we mark our trust portfolio to market value each quarter 
changes in the market value of the trusts are recorded by increasing or decreasing trust assets included in the preneed funeral and cemetery receivables and trust investments line items on the balance sheet  with a corresponding increase or decrease in the deferred preneed revenue and non controlling interest line items on the balance sheet 
therefore  there is no effect on net income 
we determine whether or not the investment portfolio has an other than temporary impairment on a security by security basis 
a loss is considered other than temporary if the security has a reduction in market value compared with its cost basis of percent or more for a period of six months or longer 
in addition  we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any of the temporarily impaired assets should be designated as other than temporarily impaired due to changes in market conditions or concerns specific to the issuer of the securities 
if a loss is other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is adjusted downward to its market value  which is allocated to the non controlling interests in the trusts 
this affects our footnote disclosure but does not have an effect on our financial statements  since the trust portfolio is already marked to market value each quarter 
the footnotes disclose the adjusted cost basis and how much of the losses are considered other than temporary 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses reflected in the tables in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included in item are temporary as the cost basis in these tables have already been adjusted to reflect the other than temporary unrealized losses 
our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and escrow accounts had other than temporary declines of million and million  respectively  as of october   from their original cost basis 
they had net unrealized appreciation depreciation of million and 
million  respectively  as of october  resulting from temporary unrealized gains and losses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item our cemetery perpetual care trust accounts had other than temporary declines of million as of october   from their original cost basis 
they had net unrealized appreciation of million as of october  resulting from temporary unrealized gains and losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item unrealized gains and losses in the cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts do not affect current earnings but unrealized losses could limit the capital gains available to us and could eventually result in lower returns and lower revenues than we have historically achieved from these trusts 
aggregate unrealized losses for twelve months or longer for temporarily impaired investments totaled million at october  of that amount  approximately percent  or million  were generated by common stock investments in companies that are included in the s p index 
these securities represent approximately percent of the securities in our portfolio 
we believe the decline in the value of these stocks is primarily due to the general decline in the s p index over the to timeframe 
since early  the s p index has risen significantly 
although we cannot predict future stock prices  our management expects that the s p index will continue to recover and that these stocks may recover along with the overall index 
we also have the ability and intent to hold these investments for the forecasted recovery period 

table of contents whether or not we classify an investment as temporarily impaired or other than temporarily impaired has no effect on our basic consolidated financial statements ie  balance sheet  statement of earnings  statement of cash flows and statement of shareholders equity because the investments are marked to market value each quarter and are included in the financial statements at current market value in accordance with our accounting under fasb interpretation no 
fin r 
the classification only affects the footnote presentation 
the cost basis of investments classified as other than temporarily impaired is reduced to market value in the adjusted cost basis column in notes  and  whereas other investments are included in that column at their actual cost basis 
we perform a separate analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position  which would necessitate a charge to earnings 
for this analysis  we determine which trusts are in a net loss position by comparing the aggregate market value of the trust s investments with the aggregate actual cost basis of the investments 
if the aggregate cost basis exceeds the aggregate market value of the investments  the trust is considered to be in a net loss position 
for trusts in a net loss position  we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and net realized earnings  then subtract net unrealized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for contracts associated with the trusts in question as of that particular balance sheet date 
we look at unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments  but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis 
we compare the amount of proceeds to the estimated costs to deliver the contracts  which consist primarily of merchandise costs 
if a deficiency were to exist  we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our backlog 
due to the margins of our preneed contracts and the relatively high trust portfolio returns we enjoyed prior to fiscal year  there is currently substantial capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would result 
cash impact of preneed sales the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
cash expended for preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales is expensed as incurred 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of the change in accounting for preneed selling costs in fiscal year overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings and increasing insurance benefits  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 revenue from constructed 
table of contents cemetery property is not recognized until a minimum percentage percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by preneed funeral trust and preneed cemetery merchandise trust accounts until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered 
in february  we completed our reconciliation of deferred revenue to the underlying preneed contracts  which resulted in the identification of a significant number of reconciling items 
our reconciliation of these items led to the restatements described above under restatement of historical financial statements and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in connection with the deferred revenue project  we also identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of october   as described in item a 
variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r 
we implemented fin r as of april   which resulted in the consolidation of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
this implementation was as of april  and only affected our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our second quarter results of operations or cash flows 
in subsequent periods  the implementation of fin r  as it relates to the consolidation of trusts  affects classifications within the balance sheet  statement of earnings and statement of cash flows  but has no effect on shareholders equity  net cash flow or the recognition and reporting of revenues or net earnings 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies after the implementation of fin r  see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for doubtful accounts management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of historical collection and write off experience 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years and from to years  respectively  primarily using the straight line method 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified a number of small businesses to close or sell in fiscal year although at the time of identification  the assets did not meet the criteria as assets held for sale per sfas no 
 
table of contents we reviewed the carrying amount of these businesses compared to their fair value and recorded a noncash charge of million related to the impairment of these long lived assets 
of this amount  million was included in continuing operations and million was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings upon these businesses meeting the discontinued operations criteria of sfas no 
in fiscal year fair value was established based on our best estimate and is subject to revision in future periods as properties are actually sold or closed 
for fiscal year  we evaluated our long lived assets  recorded impairment charges of million and sold several assets that we held for sale at a net gain of million 
the net effect was that we reported gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of million in continuing operations and recorded gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of million in discontinued operations 
in fiscal year  we recorded gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item valuation of goodwill our historical evaluation of goodwill was performed at the funeral and cemetery segment levels  which we previously reported as our reporting units 
however  this evaluation was incorrect and our operating segments  as defined by sfas no 
 and reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 were required to be restated as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item this restatement of reporting units resulted in the need to correct our goodwill impairment reviews as of november  the date we adopted sfas no 
and as of october   and for further discussion of the resulting charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we first compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying amounts including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value  we then measure the amount of impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination 
that is  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
step two of our impairment test involves determining estimates of the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
we may obtain assistance from third parties in assessing the fair value of certain of our assets  primarily real estate  in performing our step two analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill amounted to million as of october  and accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax 
table of contents assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
preneed selling costs on may   we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs incurred related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales 
we have applied this change in accounting principle effective november  therefore  our results of operations for the year ended october  are reported on the basis of our changed method 
prior to this change  commissions and other costs that varied with and were primarily related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service sales and prearranged funeral and cemetery merchandise sales were deferred and amortized in proportion to the preneed revenue recognized in the period in a manner consistent with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for insurance companies 
we have decided to change our accounting for preneed selling costs to expense such costs as incurred 
we concluded that expensing these costs as they are incurred would be preferable to the old method because it will make our reported results more comparable with other public death care companies  better align the costs of obtaining preneed contracts with the cash outflows associated with obtaining such contracts and eliminate the burden of maintaining deferred selling cost records 
as of november   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million million after tax  or per diluted share  which represents the cumulative balance of deferred preneed selling costs in the deferred charges line in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at the time of the change 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies 
historical insurance industry experience indicates some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with the types of claims covered by the program 
this is especially true due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate the receivables due from our insurance carriers as well as loss estimates associated with claims and losses related to these insurance coverages with information obtained from our primary insurer 
with respect to health insurance that covers substantially all of our employees  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
expected claims are based on actuarial estimates  actual claims may differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained from our insurer 
assumptions used in preparing these estimates are based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness 
together these factors will generally affect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these evaluations are used to assess the reasonableness of our insurance loss liability 
the estimated liability on the uninsured legal and employment related claims are established by management based upon the recommendations of professionals who perform a review of both reported claims and estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims 
these liabilities include the estimated settlement costs 
although management believes estimated liabilities related to uninsured claims are adequately recorded  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded liabilities 
we also have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incurred due to damage caused by hurricane katrina 
a significant portion of the expenses incurred is expected to be recovered when we negotiate a final settlement with our insurance carriers

comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year as described above in critical accounting policies  on may   we changed our method of accounting for selling costs incurred related to preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales 
we have applied this change in accounting principle effective november  prior to this time  we deferred preneed selling costs and amortized them into expense in proportion to the preneed revenue recognized in the period 
we now expense these costs in the period incurred 
in the discussion below  the amounts presented in the tables for the year ended october  reflect historical amounts and therefore are not adjusted for this accounting change 
in order to present results for the year ended october  comparable to those of which include the accounting change  we have also included a discussion of the net preneed selling costs for and their effect on gross profit 
the effect of net preneed selling costs is calculated by removing the amortization of deferred selling costs and including in expense the preneed selling costs incurred during the result of that calculation is the net preneed selling costs that would have reduced gross profit if the accounting change had been implemented in fiscal year year ended october  compared to year ended october  continuing operations funeral operations year ended october  increase decrease restated in millions funeral revenue eastern division western division corporate trust management total funeral revenue funeral costs eastern division western division corporate trust management total funeral costs funeral gross profit eastern division western division corporate trust management total funeral gross profit same store analysis same store change in average change in same store cremation rate revenue per call funeral services eastern division western division total corporate trust management consists of the trust management fees and funeral merchandise and service trust earnings recognized with respect to preneed contracts delivered during the period

funeral costs from continuing operations for the year ended october  do not include net preneed selling costs of million  which would have been expensed if the accounting change described above had been implemented in fiscal year had we included these costs in  funeral gross profit from continuing operations for the year ended october  would have decreased million from million for the year ended october  on august   hurricane katrina struck the new orleans metropolitan area and severely damaged three of our funeral homes located in that area  which is part of our western division 
this same store analysis includes these three funeral homes which had revenue of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and performed  and  funeral services in and  respectively

we experienced a percent increase in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses  or events out of the  total same store events performed  which includes the impact of hurricane katrina on our new orleans funeral homes 
excluding these three funeral homes  same store funeral services increased percent 
we believe the increase in funeral services can be attributed to the funeral home incentive compensation plan implemented in the first quarter of and to the execution of our strategic plan 
we believe a number of factors contributed to the increases in our average revenue per traditional and cremation service 
we believe the primary factors were normal inflationary price increases  more effective merchandising and packaging  our focus on training  customized funeral planning and personalization and a new program for arranger incentives 
funeral gross profit margin from continuing operations decreased from percent in the year ended october  to percent in the year ended october   primarily due to the million increase in funeral costs
