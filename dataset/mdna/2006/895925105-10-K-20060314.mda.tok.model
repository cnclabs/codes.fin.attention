item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition  changes in financial position  and results of operations for the three years ended december   of triad guaranty inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  collectively the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
certain of the statements contained herein  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements 
these statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include estimates and assumptions related to economic  competitive  and legislative developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty  which are  in many instances  beyond our control and have been made based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us 
actual developments and their results could differ materially from those expected by us  depending on the outcome of certain factors  including the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are different than anticipated  legislative developments  changes in interest rates or the stock markets  stronger than anticipated competitive activity  as well as the factors described in the safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to forward looking statements contained herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
in developing these estimates  we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  we believe the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
also  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we calculate our best estimate of reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default and loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us as of the date of our financial statements 
our reserving process incorporates various components in a model that gives effect to current economic conditions and profiles delinquencies by such factors as policy year  geography  chronic late payment characteristics  the number of months the policy has been in default  as well as whether the defaults were underwritten as flow business or as part of a structured bulk transaction 
we monitor the claims paid performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our reserve quarterly 
the process is based upon the assumption that long term historical experience  taking into consideration factors such as those described above and adjusted for current economic events that we believe will significantly impact the long term loss development  provides a reasonable basis for estimating projected claim rates frequency and claim amounts severity 
we consider severity and frequency to be the most significant assumptions in the establishment of our loss reserves 
the estimation of loss reserves is an inexact process and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these assumptions 
economic conditions that have affected the development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future in either a similar manner or degree 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  there can be no assurance that reserves will be adequate to cover ultimate loss developments on loans in default  currently or in the future 
the company s profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected to the extent that the company s estimated reserves are insufficient to cover losses on loans in default 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the loss reserve process 
the loss reserve estimation process and the analyses support the reasonableness of the best estimate of loss reserves recorded in our financial statements 
see losses and expenses under consolidated results of operations for a more detailed discussion of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

table of contents investments valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid  publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning a the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  b credit quality and c expected maturity 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion  properly valued  and any other than temporary impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
our methodology to identify potential impairments is further described in the investment portfolio section below 
the timely identification and valuation of potentially impaired securities involves many judgments 
the most significant judgments that we make relate to the estimated future cash flows on potentially impaired securities and our intent and ability to hold a security to anticipated recovery of value 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
see further discussion of the valuation of our investment portfolio under the investment portfolio section below 
deferred policy acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business  principally commissions and certain policy underwriting and issue costs which are primarily related to the production of new business  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
amortization of such policy acquisition costs is charged to expense in proportion to premium recognized over the estimated policy life 
we make judgments in the determination of estimated policy life utilized in the amortization assumptions 
the most significant judgment that we make is the estimated life of the dac 
see further discussion of dac under the financial position section below 
overview through our subsidiaries  we provide primary and modified pool mortgage guaranty insurance coverage to residential mortgage lenders and investors as a credit enhancement vehicle  typically when individual borrowers have less than equity in the property 
business originated by lenders and submitted to us on a loan by loan basis is referred to as our flow channel business 
mortgage guaranty insurance facilitates the sale of individual low down payment loans in the secondary market and provides protection to lenders who choose to keep the loans in their own portfolios 
additionally  we provide mortgage insurance to lenders and investors who seek additional default protection  capital relief  and credit enhancement on groups of loans that are sold in the secondary market 
these transactions are referred to as our structured bulk channel business 
our revenues principally consist of a initial and renewal earned premiums from flow business net of reinsurance premiums ceded as part of our risk management strategies  b initial and renewal earned premiums from structured bulk transactions  and c investment income on invested assets 
we also realize investment gains  net of investment losses  periodically as a source of revenue when the opportunity presents itself within the context of our overall investment strategy 
our expenses essentially consist of a amounts ultimately paid on claims submitted  b increases in reserves for estimated future claim payments  c general and administrative costs of acquiring new business and servicing existing policies  d other general business expenses  and e income taxes 
our profitability depends largely on a the adequacy of our product pricing and underwriting discipline relative to the risks insured  b persistency levels  c operating efficiencies  and d the level of investment yield  including realized gains and losses  on our investment portfolio 
we define persistency as the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations of policies originated during the past twelve months are not considered in our calculation of persistency 
this method of calculating persistency may vary from that of other mortgage insurers 
we believe that our calculation presents an accurate measure of the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations result primarily from the borrower refinancing or selling mortgaged residential properties and  to a lesser degree  from the borrower achieving prescribed equity levels at which the lender no longer requires mortgage guaranty insurance 

table of contents consolidated results of operations following is selected financial information for the last three years and the percentage change from year to year change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages and per share information earned premiums net losses and loss adjustment expenses net income diluted earnings per share net income for declined from  as losses and loss adjustment expenses grew faster than earned premium during the growth in net losses and loss adjustment expenses in is principally a result of the ongoing seasoning of our insurance portfolio 
in  we experienced an increase in the number of paid claims  the number of reported defaults  and the severity of paid claims causing us to significantly increase our reserve for losses to reflect these trends 
we experienced growth in earned premiums in  driven by moderate growth of our risk in force combined with an increase in premium basis points related to specific lender programs and a change in the mix of business 
comparing to  losses and loss adjustment expenses grew at a rate exceeding the growth in earned premium  but at a much more moderate rate than occurred in this increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected the seasoning of our insurance portfolio as over of the insurance in force was less than two years old at december  a substantial increase in persistency in contributed to both the increase in earned premiums and a reduction in expenses through lower dac amortization when compared to the changes in diluted earnings per share in and were consistent with the changes in net income for those years 
diluted realized investment gains  net of taxes  had no impact on diluted earnings per share in compared to an increase of in and in diluted realized gains and losses per share is a non gaap measure 
we believe this is relevant and useful information to investors because  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  it shows the effect that our discretionary sales of investments had on earnings 
we describe our results in greater detail in the discussions that follow 
the information is presented in three categories production and in force  revenues  and losses and expenses 
production and in force a summary of new production broken out between primary and modified pool and the year to year percentage changes follows change change vs 
vs 
in millions  except percentages primary insurance written modified pool insurance written total insurance written the overall mortgage loan origination market was relatively flat in compared to additionally  the percentage of loan originations for which mortgage insurance was provided declined in the decline was due primarily to the continued expansion of alternative credit enhancements such as structures 
in spite of the relatively flat overall loan origination market in  we were able to show an increase in production reflected in a net gain in market share 
refinances were a large part of the overall mortgage loan origination market in when borrowers took advantage of historically low rates during that period  resulting in a record amount of originations in 
table of contents refinances comprised of our primary insurance written in compared to in and in these factors caused our primary insurance written to decline in and from levels achieved in we anticipate that the overall mortgage loan origination market will be smaller in than in  which could further moderate our primary new insurance written 
assuming mortgage interest rates remain constant or continue to slowly increase  we expect to see production of primary new insurance written in to be at levels slightly lower than that achieved in further  we believe that the loan penetration will soften in if short term interest rates continue to rise  this type of financing should become less attractive to borrowers  which could partially mitigate the overall reduction of primary insurance written 
our modified pool insurance written grew significantly in and due to strong production in that market 
we write modified pool insurance only through our structured bulk channel 
we believe there will continue to be additional opportunities in the structured bulk market in  and we will pursue those transactions that meet our loan quality and pricing objectives 
modified pool insurance written is likely to vary significantly from period to period due to a the limited number of transactions but with larger size occurring in this market  b the level of competition from other mortgage insurers  c the relative attractiveness in the marketplace of mortgage insurance versus other forms of credit enhancement  and d the changing loan composition and underwriting criteria of the market 
although terms vary  the structured bulk market can be broadly categorized into three different segments  or tiers  depending on the risk characteristics of the loans comprising a transaction 
the loan characteristics of the three segments are a predominantly high credit quality  low loan to value ltv  fully underwritten loans that may have niche characteristics such as non conforming loan balances and risk concentrations related to geography  transaction purpose  or occupancy type  b loans that generally have high credit quality and low to moderate ltvs that have been underwritten with reduced  streamlined  or no documentation  and c generally fully underwritten loans with credit impaired borrowers fico credit score less than 
in general  we believe that structured bulk business originated in segments b and c will report a higher default rate than our primary business 
however  we also believe that the lower ltvs associated with the structured bulk business originated in segments a and b will ultimately generate lower claim rates as a proportion of the reported defaults and lower levels of severity than primary business 
we have entered into structured bulk transactions primarily in the first two segments mentioned above 
at december  and  only approximately of our insurance in force attributable to structured bulk transactions was categorized in segment c above 
the following table provides estimates of our national market share of net new insurance written  using industry definitions  through our flow and structured bulk channels based on information available from the industry association and other public sources for the years ended december   and flow channel structured bulk channel total our market share of flow business increased in due to increased writings with our targeted lenders  specifically with special lender paid programs that applied primarily to non prime loans 
these special lender paid programs are competitively priced among mortgage insurers and the production can vary from period to period  depending upon our willingness to accept the specific risk characteristics of these products 
as mentioned earlier  our structured bulk market share will vary from period to period since this market can have significantly larger transactions and our share of this market is dependent on the availability of transactions that meet our credit quality and pricing benchmarks and on our ability to bid successfully for these transactions 
the risk characteristics applicable to our primary production have changed somewhat over the past three years 
the most significant trend over the last three years has been our increased participation in the alt a marketplace 
we have defined alt a as individual loans having fico scores greater than and that have been underwritten 
table of contents with reduced or no documentation 
the following table summarizes the credit quality characteristics of our primary new insurance written over the past three years and reflects the growth in our alt a production prime alt a a minus sub prime total other risk characteristics that we consider in our underwriting discipline include the percentage of adjustable rate mortgages arms and the percentage of loans with ltv greater than 
the following table summarizes the percentage of our primary production in arms and higher ltv loans over the past three years arms ltv greater than the majority of our modified pool production has been in the alt a marketplace over the last three years 
as mentioned earlier  the ltvs on policies originated in the structured bulk channels are generally lower than those on policies we receive via the flow channel 
those policies may also have other primary coverage in front of our risk 
the percentages of arms included in our modified pool production approximate those included in our primary production during the last three years 
periodically we enter into structured bulk transactions involving loans that have insurance effective dates within the current reporting period but for which detailed loan information regarding the insured loans is not provided by the issuer of the transaction until later 
when this situation occurs  we accrue premiums that are due but not yet paid based upon the estimated commitment amount of the transaction in the reporting period with respect to each loan s insurance effective date 
however  these policies are not reflected in our insurance in force  new insurance written  or related industry data totals until we verify the loan level detail 
at december   we had approximately million of structured transactions with effective dates within the fourth quarter for which loan level detail had not been received and  therefore  are not included in our own data or industry totals 
these amounts will be reported as new production and insurance in force totals in  when the issuer of the transactions provides accurate loan level detail to us 
we have included in premium written and premium earned the respective estimated amounts due and earned during related to this insurance 
at december  we had million of structured transactions with effective dates within for which loan level detail had not been received 
the following table provides detail on our direct insurance in force at december   and in millions  except percentages change change vs 
vs 
primary insurance modified pool insurance total insurance our primary insurance in force grew in and in as a result of continued production and improvements in persistency 
primary insurance persistency improved to at december  compared to at december  and at december  the average mortgage coupon rates in our existing portfolio have declined over the past three years as a result of relatively heavy refinancings and lower rates on mortgages for home purchases than our existing average rate 
additionally  mortgage rates in the market have recently remained flat or increased slightly which will deter those borrowers seeking lower coupon rates 
these conditions have caused a reduction in cancellations from refinancing and  therefore  an increase in persistency 
we anticipate that persistency rates will continue near current levels or increase moderately for however  persistency may be adversely affected if market interest rates decline significantly from the levels experienced during 
table of contents our modified pool insurance in force grew significantly in and in due to our strong production in that market 
approximately  and of our insurance written attributable to our structured bulk channel during   and  respectively  was structured with deductibles that put us in the second loss position 
the decline in modified pool insurance written with deductibles in was the result of increased business with entities that do not utilize deductibles in their structures  although the use of deductibles remains an effective part of our modified pool risk management strategy 
alt a continues to grow as a percentage of our primary insurance in force  and the majority of our modified pool insurance is classified as alt a 
the following table shows the percentage of our insurance in force broken out by product and in total that we have classified as alt a at december   and primary insurance in force modified pool insurance in force total insurance in force we offer mortgage insurance structures designed to allow lenders to share in the risks of mortgage insurance 
one such structure is our captive reinsurance program under which a reinsurance company  generally an affiliate of the lender  assumes a portion of the risk associated with the lender s insured book of business in exchange for a percentage of the premium 
the following table shows the percentage of our direct insurance in force that was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements at december   and primary direct insurance in force total direct insurance in force the growth of the percentage of primary direct insurance in force that was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements in and in was the result of increased production from lenders that participate in captive reinsurance arrangements 
the declines in the percentage of total direct insurance in force subject to captive reinsurance in and in reflect the fact that a greater portion of our insurance in force consists of modified pool insurance in force 
none of our modified pool insurance in force is subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
we believe captive reinsurance arrangements are an effective risk management tool as selected lenders share in the risk under these arrangements 
additionally  captive reinsurance arrangements are structured so that triad receives credit against the capital required in certain risk based capital models utilized by rating agencies 
we remain committed to structuring captive reinsurance arrangements  including deep ceded arrangements where the net premium cede rate is greater than  on a lender by lender basis as we deem it to be prudent 
we will continue to be an active participant with our lender partners in captive reinsurance arrangements

in thousands  except percentages direct premium written ceded premium written net premium written change in unearned premiums earned premiums net investment income net realized investment gains other income total revenues we experienced strong growth in earned premiums in both and  primarily due to an increase in net premium written 
direct premium written is comprised of premium written for both primary and modified pool business 
our growth in total direct premiums written in over was the result of the growth of our insurance in force  offset somewhat by a decline in average basis points as modified pool business comprised a greater percentage of our insurance in force 
the premium rate for modified pool business  when calculated on insurance in force  is generally lower than that of primary business due to the structures of the bulk transactions which may include a stop loss limit and or a deductible that serve to reduce the overall risk assumed in the transaction 
renewal premiums increased million or in over as a result of growth in overall production and improved persistency 
initial  or new  premiums declined million or due to net lower premium basis points on modified pool transactions  especially those that are subject to deductibles  and a higher percentage of our production from modified pool business 
our growth in total direct premiums written in over was primarily due to a million growth in renewal premiums partially offset by an million decline in direct initial premiums 
the growth of risk in force in  resulting from improved persistency  drove the increase in renewal premiums over the declines in refinancing activity combined with increased popularity of alternative credit enhancements were the primary drivers of the decline in initial premiums in from during  the average premium rate on primary risk in force increased as the result of a greater percentage of our risk in force in the alt a and arm products that require higher premium rates

table of contents ceded premium written is comprised of premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance treaties with captive as well as non captive reinsurance companies

none of our modified pool insurance written in  and was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
the difference between net written premiums and earned premiums is the change in the unearned premium reserve 
our unearned premium liability declined million from december  to december  compared to an increase of million from december  to december  an unearned premium reserve is established primarily on premiums received on annual products  which prior to was largely attributed to modified pool transactions 
during  many of the new transactions required the remittance of premium on a quarterly or monthly basis as opposed to annually  which will further decrease the unearned premium liability going forward 
direct written premiums from the annual premium product represented of direct premium written in compared to of direct premium written in both and  respectively 
assuming no significant decline in interest rates  we anticipate our persistency will remain at current levels with a bias toward improvement in this should continue to have a positive effect on renewal earned premiums and total earned premiums in overall  based upon the above production and persistency assumptions  we expect that earned premiums will continue to increase in  but at a lower level of growth than was achieved in net investment income grew in and in primarily due to the growth in average invested assets in both years  partially offset by declines in portfolio yields 
average invested assets at cost or amortized cost grew by in and in as a result of the investment of cash flows from operations throughout those years 
our investment portfolio tax equivalent yield was   and at december   and  respectively 
we expect to see a growth in invested assets in  however  we anticipate a continuing decline in the overall portfolio tax equivalent yield as current interest rates are still below our average portfolio rate 
see further discussion of the investment portfolio later in this document 
net realized investment gains  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  are the result of our discretionary dispositions of investment securities in the context of our overall portfolio management strategies and are likely to vary significantly from period to period 
we wrote down other than temporarily impaired

net losses and lae increased significantly in over due to increases in both paid claims and reserves as a result of the continued seasoning of our portfolio 
we will focus separately on both paid claims and the increase in defaults 
the following table provides detail on paid claims and the average severity for our primary and modified pool insurance for the years ended december   and change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages paid claims primary insurance modified pool insurance total average severity primary insurance modified pool insurance total paid claims increased in and in due to the overall growth of the insurance portfolio and the seasoning of our portfolio as a larger percentage of our insurance in force reaches its anticipated highest claim frequency period of years two to five from loan origination 
to assist in the understanding of the seasoning process and the impact on paid claims  we have provided the following table that presents the percentage of primary risk in 
table of contents force at december   and by policy year which is defined as the year the insurance became effective policy year and prior total at december   of the insurance in force was originated in the prior two years and would not have generated a significant amount of paid claims in the percentage of insurance in force less than two years old decreased to at december  and at december  and thus  more of our insurance in force is currently in its peak claim paying period 
the increase in average severity also contributed to the growth in paid losses 
the increase is reflective of the larger loan sizes and  as mentioned earlier  also reflects the growth of alt a loans that generally have a larger average loan balance than the rest of our portfolio 
we expect the average severity will continue to trend upward as the newer policy years develop and the average loan amounts rise with the increase in housing prices 
however  our average severity on paid losses can fluctuate from year to year as a result of the relatively small number of claims paid in a given period 
the anticipated increase in severity and the further seasoning of the insurance portfolio indicate that paid losses will trend upward in net losses and loss adjustment expenses also include the change in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the following table provides further information about our loss reserves at december   and broken out by primary and modified pool insurance in thousands change change vs

primary insurance reserves for reported defaults reserves for defaults incurred but not reported total primary insurance modified pool insurance reserves for reported defaults reserves for defaults incurred but not reported total modified pool insurance reserve for loss adjustment expenses total reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses increased in over  primarily due to an increase in defaults  changes in the frequency of defaults resulting in claims and an increase in severity utilized in our reserving methodology 
the number of loans in default includes all reported delinquencies that are in excess of two payments in arrears at the reporting date and all reported delinquencies that were previously in excess of two payments in arrears and have not been brought current 

table of contents a significant portion of the increase in defaults occurred in fema designated areas as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
primary and modified pool insurance defaults from these fema designated areas totaled at december  at december   the number of defaults without deductibles in these fema designated areas was  which represented approximately of our total number of defaults without deductibles 
the terms of our coverage exclude any cost or expense related to the repair or remedy of any physical damage to the property collateralizing an insured mortgage loan 
we have not obtained detailed property assessments that could limit our exposure where there was significant unrepaired physical damage 
additionally  we believe that many borrowers living in certain fema designated areas did not make scheduled mortgage payments due to forbearance granted by fannie mae  freddie mac and lenders  even though the individual borrower was not significantly harmed 
given the unique circumstances surrounding that situation and absent any evidence that these would develop differently  we reserved for these defaults at our normal level 
as a result  we increased reserves approximately million for the hurricane related defaults during the fourth quarter of we will continue to monitor this situation throughout as the longer term impacts develop 
the following table shows default statistics as of december   and total business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default default rate percentage of loans in default excluding deductibles primary insurance number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default modified pool insurance number of insured loans in force number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default percentage of loans in default excluding deductibles primary alt a business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default the increase in the default rate for primary insurance is attributable to the continued seasoning of our business as a greater percentage of the insurance in force moves into the peak claim paying period 
additionally  as the alt a business becomes a larger percentage of the insurance in force  we expect default rates to increase 
as shown in the above table  the number of modified pool defaults subject to deductibles continued to increase while the number of modified pool defaults without deductibles declined in and was relatively flat in at december   no individual structured bulk transaction with deductibles as part of the structure had incurred total losses that approach these individual deductible amounts 
we do not provide reserves on modified pool defaults with deductibles until the incurred losses for that specific structured bulk transaction reach a pre established threshold 

table of contents our expectations for future claim amounts severity increased during this was primarily the result of the higher loan amounts included in the recent production 
in addition to the increase in reserves due to the impact of the hurricanes  we increased our reserves in to reflect the increase in average severity that we believe will impact the long term loss development of our insurance in force 
we anticipate that our number of loans in default for both primary and modified pool insurance will continue to increase as a larger percentage of our insurance in force reaches its peak claim paying period and as a result of overall growth of our insurance in force 
we expect reserves will increase as our business continues to grow and season 
we are cautious about housing market conditions in certain regions that have recently experienced rapid house price appreciation 
changes in the economic environment could accelerate paid and incurred loss development 
our reserving model incorporates management s judgments and assumptions regarding these factors  however  due to the uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions  and other factors that affect earnings  it is difficult to predict the impact of such higher claim frequencies on future earnings 
amortization of dac increased moderately in  primarily due to growth in the asset balance 
the significant decline in dac amortization in from was due to improved persistency in a full discussion of the impact of persistency on dac amortization is included in the deferred policy acquisition costs section below 
other operating expenses increased in due to growth in our insurance in force and due to expenses incurred in connection with the organizational changes following the hiring of a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer in because the growth in net premiums written was greater than the growth in expenses  the expense ratio ratio of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums written for was compared to for and for the improvement in the expense ratio for was due primarily to the decrease in dac amortization expense mentioned above 
we anticipate dac amortization to be up slightly in  primarily due to an increase in the dac asset if persistency levels remain at current levels or improve slightly 
we expect the growth in other operating expenses to moderate in when compared to however  given our expectations for premium growth  we anticipate continued improvements in our expense ratio 
our effective tax rate was for compared to for and for the declines in the effective tax rates for both and were due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest resulting from a higher percentage of assets invested in tax preferred municipal securities 
we expect our effective tax rate to remain near current levels or increase slightly as we expect earned premium to grow faster than tax preferred income 
significant customers our objective is controlled  profitable growth in both primary and modified pool business while adhering to our risk management strategies 
our strategy is to continue our focus on national lenders while maintaining the productive relationships that we have built with regional lenders 
competition within the mortgage insurance industry continues to increase as many large mortgage lenders have limited the number of mortgage insurers with whom they do business 
at the same time  consolidation among national lenders has increased the share of the mortgage origination market controlled by the largest lenders and that has led to further concentrations of business with a relatively small number of lenders 
many of the national lenders allocate primary business to several different mortgage insurers 
these allocations can go up or down over time 
our ten largest customers were responsible for   and of primary insurance written during   and  respectively 
our two largest customers were responsible for   and of primary insurance written during   and  respectively 
through actively seeking business with other lenders that meet our criteria  we are attempting to broaden our customer base and limit our concentration with these two largest lenders 
the loss of or considerable reduction in business from one or more of these significant customers without a corresponding increase from other lenders would have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents financial position total assets increased to million at december   a growth over the same date in  primarily the result of growth in invested assets 
total liabilities increased to million at december   from million in  primarily driven by an increase in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses coupled with an increase in deferred tax liabilities 
this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important in the overall understanding of our financial position 
these items include deferred policy acquisition costs  prepaid federal income tax and related deferred income taxes 
the majority of our assets are contained in our investment portfolio 
a separate investment portfolio section follows the financial position section and reviews our investment portfolio  key portfolio management strategies  and methodologies by which we manage credit risk 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs expended to acquire new business are capitalized as dac and recognized as expense over the anticipated premium paying life of the policy in a manner that approximates the estimated gross profits 
we employ a dynamic model that calculates amortization of dac separately for each year of policy origination 
the model relies on assumptions that we make based upon historical industry experience and our own unique experience regarding the annual persistency development of each year of policy origination 
persistency is the most important assumption utilized in determining the timing of reported amortization expense reflected in the income statement and the carrying value of dac on the balance sheet 
a change in the assumed persistency can impact the current and future amortization expense as well as the carrying value on the balance sheet 
our model accelerates dac amortization through a dynamic adjustment when actual persistency for a particular year of policy origination is lower than the estimated persistency originally utilized in the model 
this dynamic adjustment is capped at the levels assumed in the models  and we do not decrease dac amortization below the levels assumed in the model when persistency increases above those levels 
when actual persistency is lower than that assumed in our models  the dynamic adjustment effectively adjusts the estimated policy life utilized in the model to a policy life based upon the current actual persistency 
our dac models separate the costs capitalized and the amortization streams between transactions arising from structured bulk and flow delivery channels 
generally  structured bulk transactions have significantly lower acquisition costs associated with the production of the business and they also have a shorter original estimated policy life 
we apply the dynamic adjustment to the structured bulk dac models utilizing the same methodology 
at december  and  net unamortized dac relating to structured bulk transactions amounted to and of the total dac on the balance sheet 
the following table shows the dac asset for the previous three years and the effect of persistency on amortization dollar amounts in thousands dac asset balance beginning of year costs capitalized amortization normal amortization dynamic adjustment total amortization balance end of year annual persistency low persistency levels during caused accelerated dac amortization as can be seen by the large dynamic adjustment in that year 
as persistency improved during and  dac amortization resulting from the dynamic adjustment leveled off 
differences in persistency in the flow and structured bulk delivery channels will not have the same impact on their respective dac amortization because of the lower balance and the shorter estimated policy life of loans included in the typical structured bulk transactions 

table of contents assuming no significant declines in interest rates  we expect persistency to remain at current levels or to moderately improve in based on this assumption  we anticipate dac amortization to increase at a rate similar to growth in the dac asset 
see further information on the accounting for dac in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prepaid federal income taxes and deferred income taxes we purchase ten year non interest bearing united states mortgage guaranty tax and loss bonds tax and loss bonds in lieu of paying current federal income taxes to take advantage of a special contingency reserve deduction specific to mortgage guaranty companies 
we record these bonds on our balance sheet as prepaid federal income taxes 
purchases of tax and loss bonds are essentially a prepayment of federal income taxes that will become due in ten years when the contingency reserve is released  and the tax and loss bonds mature 
prepaid income taxes were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the change from year to year approximates the change in the deferred income tax liability for the year 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences in reporting taxable income in the financial statements and on the tax return 
these cumulative differences are enumerated in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the largest cumulative difference is the special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage insurers mentioned above 
the remainder of the deferred tax liability has primarily arisen from book and tax reporting differences related to dac and unrealized investment gains 
investment portfolio portfolio description our strategy for managing our investment portfolio is to optimize investment returns while preserving capital and liquidity and adhering to regulatory and rating agency requirements 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities  and the majority of these are tax preferred state and municipal bonds 
we have established a formal investment policy that describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
our investment policies and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory  economic  and market conditions as well as our existing financial condition and operating requirements  including our tax position 
while we invest for the long term and most of our investments are held until they mature  we classify our entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
this classification allows us the flexibility to dispose of securities in order to meet our investment strategies and operating requirements 
all investments are carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
the following table shows the growth and diversification of our investment portfolio dollars in thousands 
december  december  amount percent amount percent fixed maturity securities us government obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds mortgage backed bonds total fixed maturities equity securities total available for sale securities short term investments we seek to provide liquidity in our investment portfolio through cash equivalent investments and through diversification and investment in publicly traded securities 
we attempt to maintain a level of liquidity and duration 
table of contents in our investment portfolio consistent with our business outlook and the expected timing  direction  and degree of changes in interest rates 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements that describes the scheduled maturity of our fixed maturity investments 
the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  as we invested on a shorter time horizon during a period of unsettled long term interest rates of we also manage risk and liquidity by limiting our exposure on individual securities

we anticipate this trend to continue into unrealized gains and losses the following table summarizes by category our unrealized gains and losses in our securities portfolio at december  in thousands cost or gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value fixed maturity securities us government obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds mortgage backed bonds subtotal  fixed maturities equity securities total securities 
table of contents these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that we will realize 
changing conditions related to specific securities  overall market interest rates  or credit spreads  as well as our decisions concerning the timing of a sale  may impact values we ultimately realize 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
of the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities shown above  approximately  related to bonds with a maturity date in excess of ten years 
the largest individual unrealized loss on any one security at december  was approximately  on a corporate bond with an amortized cost of million 
gross unrealized gains and losses at december  were million and million  respectively 
credit risk credit risk is inherent in an investment portfolio 
we manage this risk through a structured approach to internal investment quality guidelines and diversification while assessing the effects of the changing economic landscape 
one way we attempt to limit the inherent credit risk in the portfolio is to maintain investments with high ratings 
the following table shows our investment portfolio by credit ratings dollars in thousands 
december  december  amount percent amount percent fixed maturities us treasury and agency bonds aaa aa a bbb bb b ccc and lower not rated total fixed maturities equities preferred stocks aa a bbb not rated common stocks total equities further  we regularly review our investment portfolio to identify securities that may have suffered impairments in value that will not be recovered  termed potentially distressed securities 
in identifying potentially distressed securities  we screen all securities held with a particular emphasis on those that have a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than 
additionally  as part of this identification process  we utilize the following information length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer 
table of contents in analyzing our potentially distressed securities list for other than temporary impairments  we pay special attention to securities that have been on the list continually for a period greater than six months 
our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value is also considered 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than nine months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment advisors or outside consultants  improving financial performance of the issuer  or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we conclude that a decline is other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
of the approximate million of gross unrealized losses at december   no securities had a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will those securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  our intent to hold certain of these securities may change in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if our intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss changes  and we do not expect the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of disposition  we will write down the security to its fair value in the period that our intent to hold the security changes 
realized losses and impairments realized losses include both write downs of securities with other than temporary impairments and losses from the sales of securities 
during  we wrote down three securities by a total of approximately  further details on the two most significant write downs in are as follows approximately  was a write down on preferred stock of a us car manufacturer for which the fair value had fluctuated below of amortized cost and was in an unrealized loss position for a continuous six month period 
the issuer had posted weak operating results throughout  lowered earnings projections  and had been downgraded by rating agencies 
we sold this security following the write down in and realized a small loss on the sale 
we also owned bonds of a financing company related to this same us car manufacturer at the time of our assessment of this impairment 
although the bonds had a fair value above of amortized cost  we determined the impairment was other than temporary due to the circumstances surrounding the related car manufacturer and wrote down the bonds by approximately  we still hold this security at december   and its fair value approximated its amortized cost at that time 
no other securities were impacted by the circumstances surrounding these impairments 
during we wrote down six securities by a total of approximately  further details on the two most significant write downs in are as follows approximately  was a write down on preferred stock in an international airline for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost for over a year 
the write down resulted from our assessment that the security was other than temporarily impaired because of a reduction in credit quality by rating agencies 
we sold this security in following the write down and realized a small gain 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down in the third quarter on common stock of a pharmaceutical company for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost after the company was required to 
table of contents cease sales of one of its major products due to alleged health risks 
rating agencies then reduced the credit ratings for this company 
we sold this security in the next quarter following the write down at an amount that approximated its carrying value after the write down 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
during  we wrote down five securities by a total of approximately  further details on the four most significant write downs in are as follows approximately  was a write down on common stock of an automobile manufacturer for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost for more than six months 
our assessment deemed that the security would not significantly recover in value over our anticipated holding period 
this security was later sold at an amount that approximated its carrying value after the write down 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on common stock of an energy provider for which the value had fluctuated below of amortized cost for more than six months 
our assessment deemed that the security would not significantly recover in value over our anticipated holding period 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on a bond issue collateralized by high yield securities that continued to experience excessive defaults on its underlying securities 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
approximately  was a write down on common stock of a pharmaceutical company for which patents on various products were expiring 
the market value of the equity had fluctuated below of its cost 
we subsequently sold these securities at an amount that approximated its carrying value after the write down 
the circumstances surrounding this impairment did not impact other securities in our portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of operating funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
operating cash flow is applied primarily to the payment of claims  interest  expenses  and prepaid federal income taxes in the form of tax and loss bonds 
we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million in compared to million for and million for the slight increase in cash flow from operating activities in reflects the growth in premiums and investment income received  largely offset by an increase in paid losses 
our business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures other than for enhancements to our computer systems and technological capabilities 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
we have no existing lines of credit due to the sufficiency of the operating funds from the sources described above 
in january of  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
we view this authorization as another capital management option available when we believe it is prudent to be purchasing our stock 
while we believe that the best opportunities available to triad for the deployment of capital are for future growth and expansion  this authorization will enable the company to purchase shares opportunistically depending on market conditions 
currently  our plans would be to liquidate some of the short term and other investments at the holding company level to fund future stock purchases  if any 
our current intention would be to immediately retire any shares repurchased 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends that an insurance subsidiary can pay the parent company 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
there have been no dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
further  there are no restrictions or requirements for capital support arrangements between the parent company and triad or its subsidiaries 

table of contents we cede business to captive reinsurance affiliates of certain mortgage lenders captives  primarily under excess of loss reinsurance agreements 
generally  reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves and unearned premiums ceded to these captives are backed by trust funds or letters of credit 
total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from net income of million and additional paid in capital of million resulting from activity related to equity awards to employees and the associated tax benefit 
statutory capital  for the purpose of computing the net risk in force to statutory capital ratio  includes both policyholders surplus and the contingency reserve 
the following table provides information regarding our statutory capital position at december  and statutory policyholders surplus statutory contingency reserve total the decline in statutory policyholders surplus reflects an increase in the statutory contingency reserve and a change in the deferred tax liability greater than statutory net income in the primary difference between statutory policyholders surplus and equity computed under generally accepted accounting principles is the statutory contingency reserve 
mortgage insurance companies are required to add to the contingency reserve an amount equal to of calendar year earned premiums and retain the reserve for years  even if the insurance is no longer in force 
therefore  a growing company such as triad normally has an increase its contingency reserve rather than in statutory surplus 
triad s ability to write insurance depends on the maintenance of its financial strength ratings and the adequacy of its capital in relation to risk in force 
a significant reduction of capital or a significant increase in risk may impair triad s ability to write additional insurance 
a number of states also generally limit triad s risk to capital ratio to to as of december   triad s risk to capital ratio was to as compared to to at december  the risk to capital ratio is calculated using net risk in force as the numerator and statutory capital as the denominator 
net risk in force accounts for risk ceded under reinsurance arrangements  including captive risk sharing arrangements as well as any applicable stop loss limits and deductible amounts 
triad is rated aa by both standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings and aa by moody s investors service 
s p has not changed its negative rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry that was issued in july of in december  fitch maintained its negative rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry 
currently  fitch  s p  and moody s all report a stable ratings outlook for triad 
a reduction in triad s rating or outlook could adversely affect our operations 
fannie mae has revised its approval requirements for mortgage insurers 
the new rules require prior approval by fannie mae for many of triad s activities and new products  allow for other approved types of mortgage insurers rated less than aa  and give fannie mae increased rights to revise the eligibility standards of mortgage insurers 
we do not see any material impact on our current or future operations as a result of the new rules  although a material impact could still occur if fannie mae were to begin to utilize mortgage insurers rated below aa or revise eligibility standards of mortgage insurers in a way that would be adverse to triad 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo issued its risk based capital rules for fannie mae and freddie mac in the first quarter of the regulation provides capital guidelines for fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with their use of various types of credit protection counterparties including a more preferential capital credit for insurance from a aaa rated private mortgage insurer than for insurance from a aa rated private mortgage insurer 
the phase in period for ofheo s risk based capital rules is ten years 
we do not believe the new risk based capital rules had an adverse impact on our financial condition through or that these rules will have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition in the future 
however  if the risk based capital rules result in future changes to the preferences of fannie mae and freddie mac regarding their use of the 
table of contents various types of credit enhancements or their choice of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  our financial condition could be significantly harmed 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have no material off balance arrangements at december  we lease office facilities  automobiles  and office equipment under operating leases with minimum lease commitments that range from one to ten years 
we have no capitalized leases or material purchase commitments 
our long term debt has a single maturity date of the following table represents our aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap category above is comprised of our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management 
the future loss payment periods are estimated based upon historical experience 
market risk exposure fixed maturity securities represented approximately of our invested assets at december  while the fair value of these fixed rate securities generally bears an inverse relationship to changes in prevailing market interest rates  a change in market interest rates would not immediately impact earnings because we generally hold these securities until maturity 
however  a decrease in market interest rates generally will have the effect of initiating an early call provision of those securities possessing such provisions 
the proceeds relating to the early called securities in a decreasing interest rate environment generally are invested in lower yielding investments that would ultimately decrease earnings 
our long term debt matures in with no early call or put provisions and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates  however  a change in rates would not impact earnings 
we believe that a increase or decrease in market interest rates is reasonable for the upcoming year 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would not have a material impact on earnings during the next fiscal year

table of contents the amount of insurance written could be adversely affected by changes in federal housing legislation  including changes in the federal housing administration loan limits and coverage requirements of freddie mac and fannie mae government sponsored enterprises  our financial condition and competitive position could be affected by legislation or regulation impacting the mortgage guaranty industry or the government sponsored entities  specifically  and the financial services industry in general  rating agencies may revise methodologies for determining our financial strength ratings and may revise or withdraw the assigned ratings at any time  decreases in persistency  which are affected by loan refinancings in periods of low interest rates  may have an adverse effect on earnings  the amount of insurance written and the growth in insurance in force or risk in force as well as our performance may be adversely impacted by the competitive environment in the private mortgage insurance industry  including the type  structure  and pricing of our products and services and our competitors  if we fail to properly underwrite mortgage loans under contract underwriting service agreements  we may be required to assume the costs of repurchasing those loans  with consolidation occurring among mortgage lenders and our concentration of insurance in force generated through relationships with significant lender customers  our margins may be compressed and the loss of a significant customer or a change in their business practices affecting mortgage insurance may have an adverse effect on our earnings  our performance may be impacted by changes in the performance of the financial markets and general economic conditions  economic downturns in regions where our risk is more concentrated could have a particularly adverse effect on our financial condition and loss development  revisions in risk based capital rules by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac could severely limit our ability to compete against various types of credit protection counterparties  including aaa rated private mortgage insurers  changes in the eligibility guidelines of fannie mae or freddie mac could have an adverse effect on the company  proposed regulation by the department of housing and urban development to exclude packages of real estate settlement services  which may include any required mortgage insurance premium paid at closing  from the anti referral provisions of the real estate settlement procedures act could adversely affect our earnings  our financial and competitive position could be affected by regulatory activity requiring changes to mortgage industry business practices  such as captive reinsurance
