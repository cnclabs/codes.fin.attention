table of contents asset quality issues in to truly appreciate the company s accomplishments of and  one must understand what we endured in preceeding years 
a summary of the events in and our subsequent progression follows 
in  we initiated several strategic changes we had changes in senior management  we began the process of consolidating our six separate bank charters into one  we engaged a new audit firm  and we switched our primary federal bank regulator from the fdic to the federal reserve 
problems with our credit quality and weaknesses in our credit administration began to surface as we implemented these changes 
in addition  as these changes were being made  the economy was in the midst of a recession and terrorists had attacked our country  further stressing the environment that we operated within 
our nonperforming loans rose from million at the beginning of to million at the end of that year 
during the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve began an examination of the bank that led to the identification of many of these problems 
as a result  we provided million to the allowance for loan losses during the fourth quarter of that basically negated our earnings for the entire year 
after the conclusion of their examination  on may   the federal reserve required our board of directors to adopt the resolution to improve the financial condition of the bank and correct the weaknesses identified in their examination 
in addition  the resolution restricted us from redeeming our capital stock  paying dividends  modifying existing debt agreements  or incurring additional debt without prior regulatory approval 
over the next months  little was accomplished that did not relate to addressing the provisions of the resolution 
on august   the federal reserve terminated the resolution with the company 
from the third quarter of  when our credit problems began to surface  to the third quarter of  when our resolution with the federal reserve was terminated  our balance sheet was in a period of contraction 
while part of the decline was due to the work out or charge off of certain loans  we also lost some business to former lenders and our competitors while our attention was diverted from business development 
in addition  we saw a decline in overall demand for loans with the down turn in the economy 
without the loan demand  we had to reduce our level of rate sensitive deposits in order to stabilize our earnings 
from the third quarter of to the third quarter of  our quarterly average balance of time deposits declined million  or 
during the same period of time  our quarterly average balance of demand and savings deposit accounts increased million  or  as we focused on retaining and attracting core  in market customer relationships 
we realize that some portion of that increase is possibly the result of our customers temporarily parking their excess liquidity due to lower interest rates and an overall lack of investment and capital spending in the economy during this period of time 
the table below shows our total loans and deposits at the end of each quarter since the end of the third quarter of as well as our net interest income and net interest margin for each of those quarters

table of contents statistical disclosures distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rates and interest differential from june to december  the federal open market committee of the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate thirteen consecutive times  in basis point increments  from to 
being in an asset sensitive interest rate position on our balance sheet our earning assets reprice more frequently than our rate sensitive liabilities  we have benefited during this period of rising interest rates 
conversely  all other factors remaining unchanged  we would expect our earnings to decrease from current levels in a declining interest rate environment 
we discuss our interest rate risk in further detail in item a 
below  we have summarized the impact that changes in interest rates and changes in our balance sheet have had on our earnings over the past three years 
the next two tables illustrate the effects of the continued repricing in interest rates and the changes in the volume of loans and deposits on our net interest income 
rate volume analysis the following table shows a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years 
thus  changes that are not solely due to volume have been consistently attributed to rate

table of contents because we have a significant concentration in construction and development loans and commercial real estate loans we must monitor and estimate trends in our real estate markets 
we will adjust our strategies or underwriting requirements in an effort to manage the risks associated with these types of lending

in  loans in our north georgia market increased and loans in our florida market increased 
while these are relatively new markets for us and some level of growth is expected  the growth that we have experienced from these markets is attributed to the addition of experienced lenders with contacts in these markets  and strong local economic activity 
our ability to continue to grow in these markets is dependent upon a continuation of these favorable attributes

this preference has contributed to our asset sensitive interest rate risk position

excluding this one impaired loan relationship  our nonperforming loans would have totaled  or of total loans as of december  at december   we had million in total delinquent loans loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  or of total loans  representing an improvement from one year ago 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when  in our judgment  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due  unless the loan is well secured 
all interest accrued for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received or until the loan is returned to accrual status 
for the year ended december   the gross interest income that would have been recorded if our nonperforming loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately  the amount of interest income on the above nonperforming loans that was included in net income for the year ended december  was approximately  the allowance for loan losses related to our nonperforming loans amounted to approximately million and  at december  and  respectively  due to an increase in specific reserves on loans individually evaluated for impairment 

table of contents allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance as a percentage of total loans was  compared to at december  we consider the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio 
as an integral part of our credit risk management process  we regularly review loans in our portfolio for credit quality and documentation of collateral 
the lenders are primarily responsible for assigning a risk grade to each loan in their portfolio 
their assessments are supplemented with independent reviews conducted by our internal audit department and external loan review consultants 
all loans in excess of  that have been identified for potential credit weakness are reviewed quarterly by a management committee  which further enhances the process for timely recognition of losses and for determining appropriate reserves 
we have a comprehensive methodology for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
we perform an allowance analysis at least quarterly that is broken down into the following three components specific allowances for individual loans  allowances for pools of loans identified by credit risk grades or delinquency status  and general allowances for all other loans pooled by loan type 
a management committee has the responsibility for assessing the risk elements  determining the specific allowance valuations  and affirming the methodology used 
the board of directors reviews management s assessment and affirms the amount recorded 
the first component of the allowance for loan loss methodology covers the measurement of specific allowances for individual impaired loans as required by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
each loan relationship with amounts due in excess of  that has been identified for potential credit weakness is evaluated for impairment 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
by definition  we consider all loans on nonaccrual status and all loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring as impaired 
if impairment is determined  a specific valuation is assessed on that loan based on realizable collateral values if collateral dependent  discounted cash flows  or observable market values 
at december   we had million in specific reserves on million in individually evaluated impaired and other significant potential problem loans 
this is an increase from the million in specific reserves on million in individually evaluated loans at december  the second component of the allowance for loan loss methodology addresses all loans not individually evaluated for impairment but are either internally rated  criticized by our banking examiners  or past due day or more 
the allowance factors are based on industry standards and supported by our own historical loss analysis 
at december   we had million in general reserves allocated to million rated and delinquent loans 
this is a slight decrease from the million reserved on a lower balance of million rated and delinquent loans at december  we had an improvement in the more severe internal loan rating categories over the past months 
the third component of the allowance addresses general allowances on all loans not individually reserved due to impairment  rating or delinquency status 
these loans are divided into smaller homogenous groups based on loan type 
the allowances are determined by applying loss factors to each pool of loans with similar characteristics 
the factors used are based on the three year historical loss percentages for each pool adjusted by current known and documented internal and external environmental factors 
the environmental factors considered in developing our loss measurements include levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the quantitative risk factors used in determining these general reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
at december   we had million in general reserves compared to million one year ago 
this increase in the general reserve over last year is primarily due to loan growth and additional caution taken into consideration for our increased concentration in construction and development lending 

table of contents this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
while we use the best information available to make the evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or other environmental factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses  and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses we have allocated the allowance for credit losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary at each year end to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category 
the components of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five years are presented below

the average rate paid on time deposits increased basis points from in to in while we have historically enjoyed a relatively low cost of funds from our core deposits  with the current rising rate environment and our plan to grow the balance sheet  we expect our cost of funds to continue to increase thus adding pressure to our ability to maintain our net interest margin at or near the level posted in the maturities of time deposits as of december  are summarized below 
retail time deposits retail time deposits brokered time deposits total time deposits dollars in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in our financial condition and affects our ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment securities  are funded by customer deposits  borrowed funds  and retained earnings 
maturities in the investment and loan portfolios also provide a steady flow of funds for reinvestment 
in addition  our liquidity continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable core deposit base and the availability of additional funding sources 
at december   our liquidity ratio was and our net noncore funding dependency ratio was 
our liquidity and funding policy provides that we maintain a liquidity position of greater than or equal to and a net noncore funding dependency ratio of less than or equal to 

table of contents investment portfolio the bank s investment portfolio is another primary source of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds that are available for cash needs 
in addition  mortgage backed securities and securities with call provisions create cash flows earlier than the contractual maturities 
estimates of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and call provisions on federal agency and state and municipals increase the forecasted cash flows from the investment portfolio 
the following table summarizes the differences between the contractual maturities and the expected available cash flows from our non equity investments 
as of december  contractual maturities expected cash flows difference dollars in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total our liquidity from investments is somewhat limited since we pledge certain investments to secure public deposits and certain borrowing arrangements 
at december   approximately of our million investment portfolio was pledged as collateral to others 
borrowings as with most community banks  loan volume is the driver for the remainder of our balance sheet 
with the strong loan demand  we commenced a campaign to increase deposits during the latter part of the third quarter of as a result of this successful campaign  we have been able to reduce our reliance on brokered deposits and other borrowings to fund our loan growth 
our brokered deposits decreased from million at december  to million at december  we have also reduced our advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb by from million at december  to million at december  during  we incurred a million prepayment penalty to repay million in fhlb advances that had a remaining average life to maturity of over five years 
the average rate on these advances was  or basis points higher than the federal funds rate at that time that we paid for funds purchased to retire the advances 
on november   pab bankshares capital trust i pab trust issued million of floating rate capital securities  also referred to as trust preferred securities 
we formed pab trust  a statutory business trust created under the laws of the state of delaware  for the sole purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by us 
the interest rates on both the trust preferred securities and the debentures are reset semi annually at libor plus currently with a rate cap of through december  we entered into agreements which  taken collectively  fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee  on a subordinated basis  all of pab trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
pab trust s sole asset is the debentures issued by us 
the debentures will mature on december   but are callable at par at our option in whole or in part anytime after december  the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
in the fourth quarter of  we intend to exercise our option to call these debentures using excess liquidity  proceeds from a new issue of trust preferred securities  or proceeds from other borrowings 
during the first quarter of  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
r revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business entities of variable interest entities and when such entities are subject to consolidation under the provisions of this interpretation 
the company has determined that the revised provisions required deconsolidation of pab bankshares capital trust i 
the interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at december   we had million in an available secured credit line with the fhlb and an additional million in unsecured fed funds lines of credit available with correspondent banks

these off balance sheet financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these financial instruments are included in the financial statements when funds are distributed or the instruments become payable 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to extend credit through open lines of credit of approximately million and outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately million 
commitments of capital in december  we entered into an agreement to purchase acres of land in oconee county  georgia  directly across the line from athens clarke county  for million 
we plan to allocate  to build and furnish a full service branch at this location in at year end  we were also in the process of adding two additional atm s in the valdosta market for a remaining cost of approximately  stockholders equity we are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by our regulatory agencies

although our net interest margin improved during  our ability to continue to improve our net interest margin in will be a challenge considering the current flattening of the interest rate curve and our rising incremental cost of funds 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through the provision  we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on growth in the loan portfolio  changes in economic conditions and other internal and external environmental factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december   we recorded million as a provision for loan losses  compared to  for the same period in the increase is due to a growing loan portfolio  balanced by continued improvement in the level of total nonperforming loans  and an improvement in several environmental factors previously discussed

we increased production staff as well as service staff during we added two new members to our executive management team a new regional president for our south georgia and florida markets and a new regional president for our north georgia markets 
we also added employees to staff the two new loan production offices that we opened in  including several senior commercial lenders 
deferred loan cost  which is a credit against salaries and wages  increased from and resulted in a decrease in expense reported during  compared to the increase in the deferral of loan costs is due to the growth in loan volume 
employee benefits increased due to an increase in health insurance premiums and an increase in our profit sharing contribution from to in occupancy expense increased in due to the addition of new facilities and the typical increases in property taxes  insurance  and utilities 
furniture and equipment expense remained fairly constant in  compared to the increase in legal and accounting fees during is attributable to several items 
we had  more legal costs attributed to litigation in than we also had  additional legal fees for various sec and other regulatory matters 
our accounting and audit fees increased  in  due to additional external audit contracts 
consulting fees increased in this increase is due primarily to increased pre employment and recruiting costs as we hired additional senior officers and lenders in our markets 
we also engaged an outside consulting firm to review our board and executive compensation plans  which increased our consulting fees in director fees increased from to due to an increase in the fee structure  including quarterly retainers paid to our directors 
we also added two new directors to our board in the first quarter of 
table of contents during  we made significant charitable contributions including over  to the hurricane relief efforts to assist those that suffered through the severe hurricane season 
we also contributed  to valdosta state university for the endowment fund that will name the vsu college of education after our founder  james l 
dewar  sr 
most other major expense categories have increased due to our increased growth 
however  our overhead efficiency ratio  a measure of noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus other noninterest income  improved from in to in income taxes the provision for income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was   and for  and  respectively 
due to an increase in taxable income  we shifted into the highest corporate income tax bracket in the difference between the effective rate and the statutory federal rate of is due primarily to income earned on our investments in and loans to tax exempt municipalities and earnings on the cash value of our bank owned life insurance 
during the fourth quarter of  we liquidated and dissolved our reits and our reit holding companies  which had previously allowed us to realize state income tax benefits 
we also invested in affordable housing during to receive state of georgia low income housing tax credits that will help reduce our state income tax expense in and the next nine years 
fourth quarter results for the fourth quarter of  our net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per share  in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we provided  to the allowance for loan losses  compared to  in the fourth quarter of our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was compared to in the average yield on earning assets grew basis points to in the fourth quarter of from in correspondingly  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities also increased  from in to in  or basis points 
impact of inflation inflation impacts the growth in total assets in the banking industry and causes a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates to meet capital adequacy requirements 
we cope with the effects of inflation through managing our interest rate sensitivity gap position  by periodically reviewing and adjusting our pricing of services to consider current costs  and through managing our dividend payout policy relative to our level of income 
there has been minimal inflation experienced in the last three years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and the related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that our determination of the allowance for loan losses and the fair value of assets  including the impairment of goodwill  affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are described in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements provided in item of this report 
the following is a brief description of the company s critical accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgment 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors including  but not limited to  reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on segments of the loan portfolio  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 

table of contents loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on either the fair value of the underlying collateral  the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  or the estimated market value of the loan 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg  discount rate and methodologies eg  comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
management s assessment is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
changes in various internal and external environmental factors including  but not limited to  the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  or the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
should these environmental factors change  a different amount may be reported for the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimates of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  goodwill  other real estate owned  and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates  or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 
recent accounting pronouncements in management s opinion  there are no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material impact on pab s earnings or financial position as of or for the year ended december  for more detailed disclosure on recent accounting developments  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  we manage our exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not engage in trading activity nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we have not engaged in any off balance sheet hedging activities or entered into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than collateralized mortgage obligations and structured government agency notes  which are commonly held investment securities 
finally  we have no material direct exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is our policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon between and 
at december   our one year management adjusted gap ratio of was outside of our policy guidelines 
however  it is more neutral than our one year gap position of at december  in  after suffering through a period of rapidly declining interest rates that compressed our net interest margins by basis points from in to in  we positioned the company s balance sheet to an even more asset sensitive position anticipating the eventual rise in interest rates from those historic lows 
in doing so  we have contributed to improving our net interest margin in each successive year 
as we look forward  anticipating an eventual downturn in interest rates  we have begun to reduce the level of asset sensitivity on the company s balance sheet 
we are also considering the possibility of utilizing off balance sheet swaps and floors to hedge our interest rate risk in a falling rate environment 

table of contents the table below has two measures of gap  regulatory and management adjusted 
the regulatory gap considers only contractual maturities or repricings 
the management adjusted gap includes assumptions regarding prepayment speeds on certain rate sensitive assets  the repricing frequency of interest bearing demand and savings accounts  and the stability of core deposit levels  all of which are adjusted periodically as market conditions change 
the management adjusted gap indicates we are highly asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates in the short term 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
cumulative repricing gap analysis month month year dollars in thousands regulatory defined rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl rsa minus rsl gap gap ratio rsa rsl management adjusted rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl rsa minus rsl gap gap ratio rsa rsl we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining  and flat interest rate scenarios allows us to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to increases or decreases in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
using our financial data and assumptions as of december   our simulation model projected net interest income would increase over the next twelve month period if market rates immediately rose by basis points 
on the other hand  the model projected net interest income to decrease over the next twelve month period if market rates immediately fell by basis points 
this high degree of volatility in our earnings is due primarily to our asset sensitive balance sheet mix and our behavioral assumptions for repricing and prepayment speeds 
our policy states that net interest income cannot be reduced by more than using this analysis 
however  as noted above  we positioned our balance sheet in order to benefit from the rising rate environment 
we intend to reduce our earnings volatility to be in compliance with our policy limits over the next six to twelve months by reducing our asset sensitivity and possibly through off balance sheet hedging instruments 
the following table shows the results of these projections for net interest income expressed as a percentage change over net interest income in a flat rate scenario for both a gradual change in market interest rates over a twelve month period and an immediate change  or shock  in market interest rates
