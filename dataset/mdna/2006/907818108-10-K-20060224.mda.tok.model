item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable operating segment 
although revenue is analyzed by commodity  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network 
the consolidated financial statements in also include discontinued trucking operations  consisting of otc and motor cargo  which were subsidiaries of overnite  inc  formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of upc 
in  we reclassified our trucking operations as discontinued operations 
executive summary results safety we experienced mixed safety results during while the overall employee injury incident rate per  man hours decreased  the lost workday case rate increased by 
the number of derailments declined  and associated costs declined 
these improvements reflect our use of technology such as train simulators and improved training and testing programs 
in the area of public safety  we closed grade crossings to reduce exposure and installed video cameras in locomotives to better analyze grade crossing incidents 
the number of grade crossing incidents  however  increased during the year  driven in part by the combination of increasing highway and rail traffic 
commodity revenue growth our commodity revenues grew year over year to billion  the highest level in our history  as continued economic growth led to unprecedented demand for our services 
we achieved record revenue levels in all of our six commodity groups  primarily driven by fuel surcharges and better pricing 
by year end  we repriced approximately of our business in the current market of significant transportation demand 
although volume increased to record levels in  weather related disruptions limited volume growth 
network improvement we continued to address the resource shortages that led to operational challenges throughout by aggressive hiring and training of train crews  along with the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars through both long and short term leasing programs 
in  network operations improved in spite of significant weather related challenges 
we handled record volumes and maintained velocity by strengthening our operational recoverability 
we began implementing the unified plan in  streamlining the automotive  manifest  and intermodal transportation plans by eliminating switching and work events 
through the year we reduced our rate of train stops by and achieved a reduction of our car switching rate 
productivity improved  as demonstrated by a lower average terminal dwell time  a improvement in car utilization  and a decrease in the fuel consumption rate 
additionally  we piloted an operational productivity initiative called cims customer inventory management system 
cims complements the unified plan by reducing the number of cars in our terminals 
we also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity  ease capacity constraints  and improve asset utilization 

table of contents significant weather events in  we faced a year filled with significant weather related challenges in early january  a massive storm hit california and nevada 
our rail system suffered significant damage  temporarily closing five of our six routes in and out of los angeles 
we embargoed traffic to and from southern california and the las vegas area until service could be restored  and we rerouted a number of trains 
logo logo in may  unprecedented rainfall and snow  combined with accumulated coal dust in the roadbed  created track instability on the sprb joint line 
the extensive and ongoing maintenance and restoration program disrupted and reduced shipments beginning mid may and continuing throughout most of the year 
in august and september  hurricanes katrina and rita hit the new orleans and houston areas 
hurricane katrina caused minimal damage to our rail system 
however  hurricane rita impacted operating subdivisions  five classification yards  and the houston terminal complex 
more than of our customers temporarily ceased operations resulting in lost revenue and higher operating expenses 
logo logo on october  a severe storm hit northeastern kansas 
the storm dropped to inches of rain in one day  causing track and bridge washouts as well as erosion damage to four main lines in this region 
these major corridors serve as the primary connection to the east and south from the western part of our system 
average train speed and average terminal dwell time for october deteriorated mph and  respectively  from september levels 
fuel prices fuel prices increased dramatically in  raising our average system fuel price by and adding million of operating expenses compared to fuel prices soared in the latter part of the year  as crude oil prices topped out over per barrel in september  compounded by high diesel conversion spreads and large  regional spreads resulting from refinery shutdowns following hurricanes katrina and rita 
prices decreased slightly in november and december  but to levels considerably higher than although we had no fuel hedges in place in  our fuel surcharge programs helped mitigate the impact of these higher fuel prices 
our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover from customers a portion of the increase in fuel expense in the form of higher revenue 
in addition  our fuel conservation efforts allowed us to handle a increase in gross ton miles while burning less fuel 
free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled a record billion  yielding free cash flow of million in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 

table of contents free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure under sec regulation g 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid free cash flow proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 
net free cash flow outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  and the public 
our employee safety program addresses the key drivers of performance 
the large number of new employees and managers will be trained  tested  and participate in quality assurance activities 
we continue to apply technology to enhance safety 
from a public safety standpoint  we will continue our efforts to upgrade and close crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public on crossing safety  along with other activities 
we will continue our derailment prevention efforts  emphasizing the use of key factor analysis 
commodity revenue growth we expect record revenue levels to continue in based on current economic indicators  forecasted demand  and the opportunity to reprice of our business 
we have established a target for year over year commodity revenue growth over percent 
we are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups and we intend to manage total volume growth to in an effort to improve returns 
volume growth is expected to occur in the energy  intermodal  and industrial products commodity groups 
transportation plan in  we continued to implement the unified plan  which streamlined segments of our transportation plan 
in  we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency 
we plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives  improve productivity using industrial engineering techniques  and improve our operating margins 
fuel prices we expect that fuel prices will remain high  with crude oil prices hovering in the range of to per barrel throughout the year 
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we will continue to increase the amount of traffic subject to fuel surcharge programs 
capital plan in  we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately billion and the net present value of additional long term operating leases to be approximately million 
these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors  remove bottlenecks  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs  build and improve facilities and terminals  and develop and implement new technologies 
major capital projects in include expanding double track on the sunset corridor  continuing enhancements on the sprb joint line  improving the freight car terminal infrastructure in san antonio  dallas fort worth  and houston  and continuing installation of centralized track control across iowa 
we expect to fund our cash capital expenditures through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and 
table of contents non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  this focused capital plan will help us improve network velocity and facilitate revenue growth 
financial expectations we anticipate revenue growth and continued network improvement in  and financial results should exceed levels 
our expectations include generating diluted earnings per share in the range of to and improving our operating ratio by to percentage points compared to free cash flow for the year should exceed million 
our free cash flow target reflects approximately to million of higher cash tax payments resulting from the impact of higher cash tax rates and higher expected earnings 
results of operations operating revenue millions of dollars change v change v commodity revenue other revenue total operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries  revenue from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenue  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by the railroad 
we recognize commodity revenue on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
we allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred 
we recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during  with double digit growth in the agricultural  industrial products  and intermodal commodity groups 
fuel surcharges  price increases  and index based contract escalators  which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indexes  all contributed to higher average revenue per car arc 
in  our fuel surcharge programs generated billion in commodity revenue  which represents approximately of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs currently  per gallon 
although volume grew for the year  the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the sprb joint line constrained volume growth 
the commodity revenue increase in was driven by growth in the industrial products  intermodal and chemical groups 
fuel surcharges  price increases  and index based contract escalators contributed to the increase in arc 
in  our fuel surcharge programs generated million in commodity revenue  which represented of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price of per gallon 
arc improved to  while revenue carloads increased 
subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in  mainly driven by higher volumes 
in addition  we generated higher subsidiary revenue due to the acquisition of our joint venture partner s interest in bay pacific financial llc bay pacific  an intermodal equipment leasing entity 
passenger and subsidiary revenue increased other revenue in  although accessorial revenue declined 

table of contents the following tables summarize the year over year changes in commodity revenue  revenue carloads  and average revenue per car by commodity type 
commodity revenue in millions of dollars change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total revenue carloads in thousands change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total average revenue per car change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total 
table of contents agricultural price increases and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in total carloads did not increase from carloads of grain products increased during as we shipped more dry feed ingredients to mexico and more corn to ethanol producers 
higher demand for ethanol reflects the impact of energy demand  rising crude oil prices  and limited capacity of domestic refineries 
reduced carloadings of sugar beets partially offset the gains 
declining carloads of feed grain and reduced shipments of wheat both contributed to lower whole grain shipments 
arc improvement in resulted from price increases  fuel surcharges  and the positive impact of a larger percentage of carloads with longer average lengths of haul 
increased demand for dry feed ingredients and domestic feed grains drove the improvement in export corn and soybean shipments also posted revenue gains from rising demand for shipments to the pnw 
revenue also increased through additional shipments of export wheat to mexico and gulf ports 
arc grew due to a higher percentage of shipments with longer average lengths of haul  as well as price increases and fuel surcharges 
logo logo automotive revenue increased in primarily due to fuel surcharges and price increases  which also drove arc improvement 
carloads decreased due to lower shipments of domestically manufactured finished vehicles and automobile parts and materials  reflecting continued weakness in this sector 
increased volume of both finished vehicles  primarily from international shippers  and automotive materials shipments drove revenue growth in this growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments for domestic manufacturers due to lower production levels and weaker sales 
arc improved slightly in due to fuel surcharges and the favorable impact of more shipments with longer average lengths of haul 

table of contents chemicals price increases  fuel surcharges  and higher shipments of potash from canada to portland via the eastport  idaho  gateway for overseas export drove revenue growth in declines in liquid and dry chemicals  plastics  and petroleum shipments  in part due to the business interruptions caused by hurricane rita  reduced volume 
in addition  liquid and dry chemical shipments and plastic shipments were lower due to a weak export market  plant closures for maintenance  and the impact of an agreement with the bnsf for access to certain facilities in the bayport  texas area 
arc improved for the year due to price increases and fuel surcharges 
in  liquid and dry chemical shipments  led by intermediate chemicals and caustic soda  rose due to overall economic activity 
shipments of soda ash  or sodium carbonate  which is an important raw material for manufacturing  increased due to strong demand in domestic and export markets 
an improved economy and a stronger export market led to volume and revenue growth for plastics 
overall  arc improved due to longer average lengths of haul  increased shipments of high arc soda ash  and the positive effects of price increases and fuel surcharges 
logo logo energy revenue growth in reflects higher prices  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators 
although volume grew in the first quarter  carloads for the year were flat as a result of the maintenance and restoration work on the sprb joint line during the second  third  and fourth quarters  the impact of hurricane rita  the kansas washouts  and temporary outages at mines in colorado and utah during the fourth quarter 
arc was higher due to price increases  higher fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators 
in  overall volume dropped slightly compared to record levels set in  however  coal originating in colorado increased due to strong demand for this high btu coal 
price increases and fuel surcharges drove arc improvements  which were offset by the impact of additional shorter lengths of haul shipments 

table of contents industrial products price increases and fuel surcharges generated revenue growth in in particular  lumber shipments contributed to this growth due to solid pricing gains and fuel surcharges 
revenue from stone shipments increased revenue from construction products due to strong construction demand  larger train sizes  and improved car cycle times 
car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system measured from the origin of the loaded or empty move until arrival at final destination 
overall carloads were flat compared to partially offsetting substantial volume growth of stone shipments were reduced paper moves  primarily newsprint and fiber  and fewer shipments of government materials  steel  and cement  resulting from softening markets  cement shortages in certain markets  and higher inventories 
price increases and fuel surcharges drove arc increases 
growth in lumber  steel  and non metallic minerals led to higher revenue in demand for lumber was driven by higher housing starts and low interest rates 
steel shipments increased as strong global demand limited imports and spurred demand for domestic steel 
arc improved due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and more high arc lumber moves 
logo logo intermodal revenue in improved due to strong imports  primarily from china and the rest of asia 
however  business interruptions during the first quarter of due to the west coast storm limited full year revenue growth 
arc improved due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators 
overall economic conditions and an increase in imports from the far east improved revenue in fuel surcharges and price increases contributed to arc growth 
mexico business each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico  which increased to billion in compared to revenue growth resulted primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges 
carloads were flat versus  as fewer auto parts  energy  and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments 
in  revenue grew to million  resulting from increased volume in the industrial products  intermodal  chemical  and automotive business groups  particularly cement  newsprint and wood fiber  liquid and dry chemicals  soda ash  and automotive materials 
revenue generated from agricultural shipments also improved due to higher wheat exports and beer imports 
lower export shipments of corn and feed grains  as well as reduced energy carloads  partially offset the increases 

table of contents operating expenses millions of dollars change v change v salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel and utilities equipment and other rents depreciation materials and supplies casualty costs purchased services and other costs total operating expenses increased million in versus excluding the asbestos charge of million pre tax in  operating expenses increased billion  or 
significantly higher locomotive fuel prices accounted for million of this increase our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue 
inflation in wages  benefits  materials  and services  as well as a larger workforce  resulted in most of the additional increase 
also driving higher operating expenses were increased contract services and clean up and restoration costs associated with the west coast storm in january 
higher fuel prices  the asbestos charge of million pre tax  higher crew and asset utilization costs resulting from slower network velocity  and volume related costs all contributed to higher operating expenses in expenses were also negatively impacted by wage and benefit inflation  training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen  increased depreciation expense  and higher casualty costs 
a jury verdict upheld against the railroad in for a crossing accident and a derailment in san antonio  texas  increased casualty costs 
slower network velocity and service difficulties  and increased hiring and training efforts added approximately million in operating expenses during logo salaries  wages  and employee benefits several factors drove higher employment expenses in general wage and benefit inflation continued to increase expenses  reflecting higher salaries and wages and the year over year impact of higher healthcare and other benefits costs 
we also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in  as executive bonuses were not awarded for and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced 
a increase in our workforce and higher demand during the year also contributed to the increases 
additionally  labor expenses  in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and clean up activities  increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the west coast storm in the first quarter 
reduced severance and relocation costs  increased network efficiency  and reduced training expenses 
table of contents partially offset these increases 
transferring various support personnel to omaha  nebraska  resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in the increase in also resulted from a number of factors  including higher wages and training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen  increased crew costs due to slower network velocity  inflation  volume related expenses  and severance and relocation costs 
because we did not award executive bonuses for  lower performance based compensation expense for management partially offset these increases 
lower protection costs also offset these increased expenses 
protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee s protected rate of pay 
the stb mandates protected rates for employees adversely affected by a merger  and collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions also establish these rates 
finally  a smaller non transportation workforce yielded cost savings during the year 
fuel and utilities millions of dollars change v change v locomotive fuel expense fuel surcharge revenue fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel  utilities other than telephone  and gasoline and other fuels 
higher diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by million 
a increase in gross ton miles resulted in million of additional expenses 
we offset million of these increases with a improvement in our consumption rate in versus the railroad had no fuel hedges in place during  and has none in place for gasoline  utilities  and propane expenses increased million in versus due to higher prices 
the increase in compared to was driven by higher diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon and per gallon in and  respectively including taxes and transportation costs  and higher gallons consumed 
higher fuel prices contributed million to the increase  however  we recovered approximately of these costs through our fuel surcharge programs  which were included in operating revenues 
the increase in gross ton miles in drove consumption higher  resulting in an additional million in fuel expense for the year 
the railroad hedged approximately of its fuel usage in  which decreased fuel costs by million 
gasoline  utilities  and propane expenses increased million in due to higher prices 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  other specialty equipment leases  and office and other rentals 
in  the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased  resulting in additional lease expenses 
higher carloads also increased expenses 
improved car cycle times partially offset these increases reflecting increased network efficiency  which lowered our short term freight car rental expense 
expenses increased in due to carload volume growth and longer car cycle times  resulting in higher expenses for locomotive and car rentals 
higher locomotive expense included additional costs associated with leasing short term  or surge  locomotive power  which is more costly than long term locomotive leases  and the increased leasing of new locomotives 
depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  increased our depreciation expense in and 
table of contents materials and supplies materials used to maintain the railroad s lines  structures  and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense 
this expense item also includes small tools  office supplies  other materials  and the costs of freight services to ship railroad supplies and materials 
during  materials and supplies expense increased  primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance 
we used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives  including a growing number of units not covered by warranties 
additionally  we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets  traction motors  and lube oil 
conversely  we incurred lower freight charges for shipping railroad materials and stationary and office supplies 
we incurred higher expenses in due to increased use of locomotive repair materials required to maintain a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties 
we also performed more freight car repairs  incurred higher materials costs  and experienced increased freight charges for shipment of railroad material 
casualty costs personal injury expense  freight and property damage  insurance  and environmental costs are the primary components of casualty costs 
casualty costs in were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in for an asbestos charge  a costly derailment near san antonio  and a large jury verdict affirmed in for a crossing accident 
lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced casualty costs 
conversely  we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for third party personal injuries related to long term environmental exposures 
in  costs rose due to the asbestos charge of million pre tax  a costly derailment near san antonio  and a large jury verdict affirmed in for a crossing accident 
partially offsetting these increases were lower insurance expenses and reduced personal injury expense  which resulted from lower than anticipated settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in than previously assumed 
purchased services and other costs purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  state and local taxes  net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads  transportation and lodging for train crew employees  trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers  leased automobile maintenance expenses  telephone and cellular phone expense  employee travel expense  and computer and other general expenses 
expenses decreased in versus because we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to omaha  nebraska during in  we experienced higher volume related costs for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging 
although our intermodal carloadings increased over in  costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies 
higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in  which resulted in higher state and local taxes 
other contract services increased in the january west coast storm and hurricanes katrina and rita also contributed to higher expenses in net of insurance reimbursements received 
in  higher locomotive contract maintenance services  state and local taxes  and relocation costs drove expenses higher 
in addition  we incurred increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume 
non operating items millions of dollars change v change v other income interest expense income taxes 
table of contents other income other income increased in largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program 
in addition  other income in included income recognized from the sale of a technology subsidiary s assets 
other income improved in due to higher costs in associated with premium payments for early retirement of billion of convertible preferred securities cps and income recognized in from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary 
these were partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales in compared to interest expense lower interest expense in and was primarily due to declining weighted average debt levels of billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
our effective interest rate was in both and  compared to in income taxes income taxes were greater in due to higher pre tax income  which was partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense 
in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   we reported that the corporation had undertaken an analysis of the impact that final settlements of tax liabilities for pre tax years with the internal revenue service irs had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the completed analysis of the final settlements for pre tax years  along with irs examination reports for tax years through were considered  among other things  in a review and re evaluation of the corporation s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of september   resulting in an income tax expense reduction of million in income tax expense decreased in  driven by lower pre tax income  a reduction in the deferred state income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to omaha  nebraska  state income tax credits earned in connection with the new headquarters building in omaha  and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the passage of the american jobs creation act of discontinued operations on november   we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest 
in  revenue and income from discontinued operations were billion and million  respectively 
income from discontinued operations in included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of million  including an income tax benefit of million 
operating and financial statistics railroad performance measures we report key railroad performance measures weekly to the american association of railroads  including carloads  average daily inventory of rail cars on our system  average train speed  and average terminal dwell time 
this operating data is available on our website at www

com investors reports index 
shtml 
operating statistics change v change v average train speed miles per hour average terminal dwell time hours gross ton miles billions revenue ton miles billions average full time equivalent employees 
table of contents average train speed average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals 
in  the west coast storm  disruptions on the sprb joint line  business interruptions caused by hurricane rita  and the kansas washouts in october hampered efforts to improve our average train speed 
in  unprecedented demand for our services and crew and locomotive shortages negatively impacted operational efficiency and average train speed 
average terminal dwell time average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals 
lower average terminal dwell time is favorable 
the improvement in dwell time in resulted from strategic network management initiatives and efforts to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers 
record demand levels and operational challenges experienced in affected network performance including average terminal dwell time 
gross and revenue ton miles gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled 
revenue ton miles are based on tariff miles and do not include the weight of freight cars 
in  gross and revenue ton miles grew and  in relation to a increase of carloadings 
gross and revenue ton miles increased and respectively in  with growth of carloadings during the same period 
the increase in gross and revenue ton miles was also positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals  combined with a minimal increase in automotive carloads  which is a lower density commodity 
average full time equivalent employees the increase includes the addition of employees needed to complete increased track repair and replacement programs  more train crew personnel both to handle the increased demand and to improve service  and the hiring of operations management personnel  including an expanded management training program 
the average number of full time equivalent employees increased as we added train crew personnel  who were hired to handle increased customer demand and improve service 
these additions were partially offset by increased productivity in the non transportation functions  employee attrition  and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries 
other financial statistics change debt to capital pt lease adjusted debt to capital pt debt to capital lease adjusted debt to capital debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity 
lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total debt plus equity plus the net present value of operating leases 
we believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital 
in  our debt to capital ratio improved due to a million reduction in our debt level and an increase in equity resulting from earnings 
our lease adjusted debt to capital improved to a lesser extent due to an increase in the present value of operating leases  which were approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively  using a discount rate of 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  the sale of receivables  and our revolving credit facilities  as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of credit facilities available  of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements  including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating 
if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 
table of contents program was million as of december  access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
at december  and  we had a working capital deficit of  million and million  respectively 
a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
financial condition cash flows millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities higher income  lower management incentive payments in executive bonuses  which would have been paid to individuals in  were not awarded based on company performance in and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced  and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in a voluntary pension contribution of million in also augmented the positive year over year variance 
this improvement was partially offset by cash received in for income tax refunds 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in driven by lower income from continuing operations  the pension contribution  and cash from discontinued operations recognized in  which were partially offset by working capital performance 
cash used in investing activities increased capital spending  partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales  increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in the comparative increase in primarily resulted from the beneficial impact of the million received in for the sale of our trucking interest  which reduced cash used in investing activities in the permanent financing of locomotives and freight cars under long term operating leases as referenced in the operating lease activities section in this item had no impact on investing cash flows during the period as all financings were completed in cash used in financing activities the increase in cash used in financing activities results from no cash inflows from the issuance of debt in compared to million in and higher debt repayments million in compared to million in  partially offset by higher net proceeds from equity compensation plans million in compared to million in 
the decrease in resulted from lower debt repayments of million in compared to billion in including billion of cps  partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from equity compensation plans million in compared to million in and higher dividend payments million in compared to million in due to the increase of our dividend rate from per share in to per share in 
table of contents the table below details cash capital expenditures for the years ended december    and  including non cash capital lease financings of million in there were no non cash capital lease financings in or capital expenditures millions of dollars track locomotives freight cars facilities and other total in  we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately billion 
additionally  we expect to enter into long term operating leases for equipment with a net present value of approximately million 
these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors  remove bottlenecks  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs  build and improve facilities and terminals  and develop and implement new technologies 
we expect to fund our cash capital expenditures through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for for the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
financing activities credit facilities on december   we had billion in revolving credit facilities available  including billion under a five year facility expiring in march and billion under a five year facility expiring in march collectively  the facilities 
the facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper 
neither of the facilities were drawn as of december  the five year facility expiring in march replaced a billion day revolving credit facility that expired in march  while the five year facility expiring in march was put in place in to replace a five year revolving credit facility that was due to expire in march commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers 
these facilities allow for borrowings at floating london interbank offered rates libor based rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral 
in addition to our revolving credit facilities  we also had million in uncommitted lines of credit that were unused at december  we established two million uncommitted lines of credit in may and july  which will expire in may and july  respectively 
at december   approximately million of short term borrowings that we intended to refinance were reclassified as long term debt 
this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance these short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis 
at december   we did not reclassify any short term debt to a long term basis 
dividend restrictions we are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities 
retained earnings available for 
table of contents dividends increased to billion at december   from billion at december  we do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
shelf registration statement under a current shelf registration statement  we may issue any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
at december   we had million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement 
we have no immediate plans to issue any securities  however  we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration  and  therefore  we may issue debt securities at any time 
operating lease activities as of december   our contractual obligations for operating leases totaled approximately billion 
discounted at  the present value of this obligation was approximately billion 
the railroad entered into lease arrangements during to finance its new equipment acquisition program 
in  the railroad  as lessee  entered into long term operating lease arrangements covering locomotives and approximately  freight cars 
the lessors under these lease arrangements purchased the locomotives and freight cars from the corporation through various financing transactions that totaled approximately million  with a present value of million 
these new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately billion  which are reflected in the contractual obligations table as of december  the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars  in part  by the issuance of equipment notes that are non recourse to the railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the equipment 
neither the railroad nor upc guarantees payment of the equipment notes 
the railroad s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars 
if the railroad elects not to exercise any such options  the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 
on july   the railroad completed the acquisition of its partner s interest in bay pacific financial llc  a joint venture established to assist in the acquisition of containers and chassis for use by the railroad in intermodal service  for a purchase price of million 
as a result of the acquisition  the railroad owns of the joint venture 
total minimum rental payments for operating leases acquired in the acquisition were million at the time of acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments as described in the notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
however  based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
in addition  the commercial obligations  financings  and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations  particularly within the transportation industry

d 
none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december  sale of receivables the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  as part of a sale of receivables facility 
upri sells  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was million at december  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by  million and  million of accounts receivable held by upri at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was million and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and 
table of contents dilution 
if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point  the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by million 
should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad services the sold receivables  however  the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the costs include interest  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad have no recourse to the assets of upri 
on august   the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional day period without any significant changes in terms 
guarantees at december   we were contingently liable for million in guarantees 
we recorded a liability of million for the fair value of these obligations as of december  we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business  and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building  equipment financings  and affiliated operations 
the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows 
the use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements 
the purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 
in addition  we enter into secured financings in which the debtor pledges collateral 
the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor determine the collateral 
these arrangements generally prohibit us from selling or repledging the collateral unless the debtor defaults 

table of contents determination of fair value we determined the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december  and based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate  libor  or swap spread 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt representing approximately and  respectively  of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
we accounted for the swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore  we did not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of million 
market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to approximately million at december  market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   amounted to approximately million at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects earnings 
in  we entered into treasury lock transactions  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these treasury lock transactions resulted in a payment of million that is being amortized on a straight line basis over years  ending september  the unamortized portion of the payment is recorded as a million after tax reduction to common shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
fuel cash flow hedges fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
in and  our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs 
however  we may use swaps  collars  futures and or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 
we hedged million gallons of fuel during using collars with average cap  floor  and ceiling prices of   and per gallon  respectively 
at december   there were no fuel hedges outstanding  and we did not have any fuel hedges in place during 
table of contents accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
the statement requires that we recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share based payments starting january  we adopted the statement on a modified prospective basis  using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options 
we expect that the incremental  full year compensation expense in related to the adoption of the statement will be approximately million for new awards granted after january  and an additional million for the unvested portion of awards granted in prior years 
the expense for awards granted after implementation of the statement will be based upon their grant date fair value 
the expense for those awards will be based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
that estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of awards to vest will differ from the estimate 
the estimate does not materially impact our calculation of compensation expense 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligations  as used in fasb statement no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement  or both  are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we assessed the impact of the interpretation on our financial statements  determined that we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos containing materials  and recorded a million liability at december   for the fair value of this obligation 
in may  the fasb issued fas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
it carries forward without change the previous guidance for reporting the correction of an error and a change in accounting estimate 
fas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as drafted  the interpretation would require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit 
however  in november the fasb voted to replace the probable threshold with a more likely than not criterion when determining if the impact of a tax position should be recorded 
the fasb expects to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of when it is available  we will review the final interpretation to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an exposure draft  earnings per share  an amendment of fasb statement no 
the draft clarifies guidance for the treasury stock method  contracts that may be settled in cash or shares  and contingently issuable shares 
the fasb expects to issue a final statement in the first quarter of we are currently reviewing this proposed exposure draft to determine the impact it may have on our calculation of earnings per share 
in december  the fasb deliberated issues relating to the limited scope  first phase of its project to reconsider the accounting for postretirement benefits  including pensions 
the fasb decided that the objectives and scope of this phase include  among other items  recognizing the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or a liability in the statement of financial position 
the fasb expects to issue an exposure draft for the initial phase in the first quarter of in the second multi year phase of the project  the fasb expects to comprehensively consider a variety of issues related to the accounting for postretirement benefits  including expense recognition  obligation measurement  and whether postretirement benefit trusts should be consolidated by the plan sponsor 
we will review the proposed standards when they are available to determine the impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents commitments and contingencies various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos 
additionally  we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated 
a liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos related claims through has been estimated and recorded 
during  we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the number of claims received in will be consistent with average claims received between and the number of claims to be filed against us will decline each year after the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to those experienced between and the percentage of claims dismissed between and will continue through at december  and  million and million  respectively  was classified as liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position  of which million and million  respectively  was classified as current accrued casualty costs 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims 
these claims are expected to be paid out over the next years 
we have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos related claims  and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries 
our asbestos related claims activity was as follows claims activity open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december 
table of contents we believe that our liability for asbestos related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment  federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants  and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 
additionally  we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos containing materials 
the estimated fair value of this obligation is million at december   which is recorded as a liability on the consolidated statements of financial position pursuant to fin environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in the conduct of our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
environmental expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we had a liability of million and million  respectively  accrued for future environmental costs  of which million and million  respectively  were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use third party actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
annual expenses for personal injury related events were million in  million in  and million in as of december  and  we had accrued liabilities of million and million for future personal injury costs  respectively  of which million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years 
estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 

table of contents our personal injury claims activity was as follows claims activity open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december depreciation the railroad industry is capital intensive 
properties are carried at cost 
provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group  based on the results of a depreciation study 
we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property to the stb for review and approval 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation  and no gain or loss is recognized 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations 
the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
an obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis 
capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets 
cash capital spending totaled billion for the year ended december  in  we implemented depreciation studies  approved by the stb  resulting in lower depreciation expense of million for the year ended december   due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets effective january   partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets effective july  
for the year ended december   depreciation expense was billion 
various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets  variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes as required under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
for example  a increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part on management s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events 
based on that analysis  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million against certain deferred tax assets as of december  and  respectively 
insurance subsidiaries we have two consolidated  wholly owned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks  including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance 
at december   current accounts receivable and current accrued casualty costs included million for reinsurance receivables and reinsured liability  respectively  held by one of our insurance subsidiaries 
table of contents related to losses sustained during the west coast storm in january this amount may change in the future as facts and circumstances surrounding the claim and the reinsurance are finalized and settled 
we collected a partial recovery of our claim from reinsurance of million during the fourth quarter of pension and other postretirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for other postretirement benefits  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for and the estimated impact on pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb discount rate expected return on plan assets n a healthcare cost trend rate current n a level in n a sensitivities increase in expense millions of dollars pension opeb decrease in discount rate decrease in expected return on plan assets n a increase in healthcare cost trend rate n a cautionary information certain statements in this report  and statements in other material filed or to be filed with the securities and exchange commission as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  are  or will be  forward looking statements as defined by the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements regarding expectations as to operational or service improvements  statements concerning expectations of the effectiveness of steps taken or to be taken to improve operations  service  or to stabilize the rail system  infrastructure improvements  transportation plan modifications  and management of customer traffic on the system to meet demand  expectations as to cost savings  revenue growth  and earnings  the time by which certain objectives will be achieved  statements or information concerning projections  predictions  expectations
