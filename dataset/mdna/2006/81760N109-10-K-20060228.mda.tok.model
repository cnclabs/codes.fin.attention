item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations consolidated review of and outlook for was an encouraging year for servicemaster the company as it reported revenue and earnings per share in line with management s expectations 
it was also a year where every one of the company s business segments achieved growth in revenue and two of the company s core businesses  terminix and trugreen chemlawn  each surpassed billion in revenue for the first time 
in  the company overcame significant challenges including record high fuel prices  steadily rising interest rates  unusual weather aberrations  including the hurricanes  and continued expansion in telemarketing restrictions 
the company overcame these obstacles by focusing on what it could control  like safety  customer satisfaction  and sales force and geographic expansion 
in  the company will be implementing three significant changes to its business portfolio 
the company intends to sell american residential services ars and american mechanical services ams 
these are businesses  in large markets  with strong management teams 
these companies are making good progress on key initiatives that will make them even better in the future 
but there were two fundamental issues that led the company to the difficult decision to sell these operations 
first  is the company s need to have fewer priorities  so that it can pursue them with greater intensity 
second  the company concluded that ars and ams businesses are not compatible with the company s overall business model 
ars and ams are not built around the kind of repeat business experienced in the company s other operations  and hence the ars and ams operations are more cyclical and weather dependent 
these two businesses also operate at much lower margins  and they would require meaningful time and capital to establish widely recognized national brands such as those the company enjoys in each of its other businesses 
in february  the company announced an agreement to acquire instar services group  inc instar is a leading direct provider of commercial disaster response and reconstruction services in the united states with revenues of approximately million 
instar provides a continuum of services  from planning prior to an event  to emergency response following the event and ultimately including cleaning  recovery and reconstruction 
instar has been growing rapidly and is expected to grow at a much faster rate than the businesses held pending sale 
instar has solid profit margins and operates in an extremely large market with a tremendous opportunity to gain a larger share 
the company believes there is a great strategic fit in combining the capabilities of instar with the company s existing disaster restoration business within servicemaster clean 
servicemaster clean s disaster restoration business already totals over million in customer level revenue through its franchisee network and has been growing at double digit rates for more than five years 
the company expects the instar acquisition  after interest and amortization costs  to be accretive in the 
per share range for the period in following the acquisition 
the company has launched project accelerate  an internal  multi phase reengineering project designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of all functional support areas 
upon completion  project accelerate will result in an organization that is better aligned to respond faster to the marketplace  its customers  and provide better day to day support for front line associates who are in the homes and businesses of customers every day 
this project is consistent with the company s goal of becoming systematically stronger and is expected to have a positive financial impact on the enterprise 
the reduction in direct support costs  combined with more effective purchasing of outside services and other cost reductions  is targeted to produce annualized gross savings in the range of to million  and net savings of million to million after reinvestments into the business and the impact of factor cost increases 
those savings should begin to be realized in  and reach end state on an annualized run rate basis in excluding the effects of one time severance and implementation costs  the amounts of which the company will be determining over the course of the first quarter  the company estimates the savings from project accelerate in the per share range  helping the company to offset rising factor costs and contribute to continued strong bottom line growth 
going forward  the company will be comprised of leading service brands that collectively have strong cash flow  solid revenue growth potential  greater operating margins and stronger returns on invested capital 
the company believes that its improved portfolio  combined with solid execution of its business strategies  will enable it to deliver mid to high single digit revenue growth and low double digit earnings growth in from a base of earnings from continuing operations of  the company s earnings per share target for is 
based on the actions the company is taking in  the company s target is to achieve high single digit revenue growth and earnings per share growth in the mid teen level during and beyond  with cash from operations growing and continuing to substantially exceed net income 
compared with revenue from continuing operations for was billion  a six percent increase over most of the revenue growth was organic  with every business segment achieving increases over levels 
the company reported income from continuing operations in of million and income from businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations of million 
total net income was million in compared with million in the total included a million nonrecurring reduction in the tax provision and corresponding increase in net income resulting from the agreement with the irs 
diluted earnings per share were 
in compared with in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 
in compared with in as more fully discussed below  the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for include a 
per share million non cash reduction in the tax provision resulting from the company s agreement with the irs 
operating income for increased five percent to million  compared with million in the increase in operating income primarily reflects solid profit growth at terminix supported by improved labor and material cost efficiencies  improved profitability in the trugreen landcare operations  and reduced safety related costs throughout the enterprise 
these factors were offset in part by higher fuel costs  increased claim costs at american home shield due to hotter weather conditions  a million unfavorable adjustment recorded by terminix to correct the estimation of prior year damage claim reserves  a million gain that trugreen chemlawn realized in the third quarter of from the sale of a support facility  as well as the first time inclusion of approximately million of seasonal operating losses in the canadian operations acquired by trugreen chemlawn in april as previously disclosed  the company has experienced both positive and negative trending in some of its key factor costs 
the company s large fleet continues to be negatively impacted by significant increases in oil prices  which have also adversely impacted fertilizer costs at trugreen chemlawn 
although the company hedges approximately two thirds of its estimated annual fuel usage  even net of the hedges  fuel costs of continuing operations increased approximately million in oil prices remain high  and the company currently estimates that its continuing operations will absorb approximately 
per share of incremental fuel costs in as previously discussed  gps and routing and scheduling technologies that the company has been implementing will tighten routes and reduce drive time and fuel consumption 
health care costs continue to experience strong inflationary pressures  and this is expected to continue 
the company will also be making an additional investment in employee health care benefits of approximately 
per share in  as part of its efforts to further enhance its position as an employer of choice 
on the positive side  the company continues to experience very favorable results from its efforts to reduce safety related costs  which include workers compensation  auto and general liability claims 
in  the company achieved a four percent reduction in vehicle collisions and a double digit decline in lost employee work day cases 
total costs from continuing operations  including the income statement effects of favorable trending of prior year claims  were down almost million for the year 
the company has set a goal of to million of additional savings from continuing operations over the next two to three years 
tax agreement in january  the company reached a comprehensive agreement with the internal revenue service irs regarding its examination of the company s federal income taxes through the year as a result of this agreement  the company recorded in its financial statements certain deferred tax assets which had previously not been recorded due to uncertainties associated with the complexity of the matters under review and the extended period of time effectively covered by the examination 
this resulted in a non cash reduction in the company s income tax provision  thereby increasing consolidated net income by approximately million million  or 
per diluted share  related to continuing operations and million  or 
per diluted share  related to businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations 
related to the irs agreement  the company realized tax savings of million in  made tax payments in early totaling million and realized a million reduction in estimated tax payments in the third and fourth quarters of additionally  this agreement resulted in a deferred tax annuity totaling million that will be realized through operating and non operating expenses cost of services rendered and products sold increased five percent compared to the prior year and decreased as a percentage of revenue to percent in from percent in this decrease reflects improved labor and materials management at trugreen landcare and improvements in safety related costs throughout the enterprise 
selling and administrative expenses increased eight percent and increased as a percentage of revenue to percent from percent in the increase in selling and administrative expenses primarily reflects investments to increase market penetration and improve customer retention and other strategic initiatives 
net interest expense decreased million from  primarily reflecting lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of fixed rate debt in april  as well as higher investment income experienced on the american home shield investment portfolio 
it is important to note that investment returns are an integral part of the business model at american home shield  and there will always be some market based variability in the timing and amount of investment returns realized from year to year 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations was a percent tax expense in and a percent tax benefit in the comparison of the effective tax rate is impacted by the company s agreement with the irs which resulted in a million non cash reduction in the income tax provision for continuing operations 
the company expects that its effective tax rate for will approximate percent 
segment review vs the segment reviews should be read in conjunction with the required footnote disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this disclosure provides a reconciliation of segment operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes  with net non operating expenses as the only reconciling item 
the company s segment reviews include discussions of capital employed  which is a non us gaap measure that is defined as the segment s total assets less liabilities  exclusive of debt balances 
the company believes this information is useful to investors in helping them compute return on capital measures and therefore better understand the performance of the company s segments 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements also include a reconciliation of segment capital employed to its most comparable us gaap measure 
key performance indicators as of december  trugreen chemlawn growth in full program contracts customer retention rate terminix growth in pest control customers pest control customer retention rate growth in termite customers termite customer retention rate american home shield growth in warranty contracts customer retention rate trugreen chemlawn segment the trugreen chemlawn segment  which includes lawn care services  reported revenue in excess of billion for the first time in its history 
a four percent increase in revenue to billion from million in  was achieved in spite of continued declines in telemarketing sales and challenging weather conditions throughout much of the country 
summer drought conditions dominated several key regions  adversely impacting both production and customer retention 
although weather can periodically impact its business in the short term  the company believes that its own actions over the medium and long term will have a much greater impact on the business 
the four percent growth in revenue was supported by a two percent improvement in price realization  growth in supplemental residential eg  seeding and aeration and commercial services  as well as a one percent increase in customer counts 
management is encouraged by trugreen chemlawn s efforts to improve price realization 
this improvement resulted from disciplined efforts to reduce discounting on new sales and strategically targeted price increases to the existing customer base 
unit sales increased approximately one percent from last year s levels  as the company continues to successfully diversify its sales channels through increased emphasis on neighborhood selling  direct mail and other efforts 
expansion of these new sales channels have helped offset continued declines in telemarketing sales  which have been adversely impacted by do not call restrictions 
sales from neighborhood programs more than tripled to almost  customers in  while sales from direct mail efforts increased percent 
in  the company expects that the proportion of non telemarketing sales to total sales will continue to grow 
the shift away from telemarketing sales impacts the relative timing of customer sales 
as the company continues to develop these new channels  the timing of customer sales will be more concentrated and trend more heavily toward the early part of the second quarter  versus the historical first quarter period where telemarketing was more heavily concentrated 
trugreen chemlawn s total customer retention rate decreased basis points in  reflecting a sharp drop in the canadian operations and a nominal decrease in the us the company believes the circumstances in canada are unique  and included the combination of five acquired brands into one at the beginning of this year  as well as tightened application regulations in certain markets 
despite the decrease in  overall retention rates have increased basis points over the last four years taken as a whole  and the company is targeting  and anticipating  meaningful additional improvement in the future 
to capture that opportunity  the company has taken comprehensive steps to improve customer communication and problem resolution procedures  expand quality assurance processes  and provide focused incentives at all levels 
operating income totaled million in compared to million in the operating income comparison was adversely impacted by the million pre tax gain in from the sale of a support facility 
incremental profits from increased revenues and reduced safety related costs were offset primarily by the impacts of higher fuel and fertilizer costs and the first time absorption of approximately million of first quarter seasonal losses in the canadian operations which were acquired in april capital employed in the trugreen chemlawn segment increased two percent  primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions 
trugreen landcare segment the trugreen landcare segment  which includes landscape maintenance services  reported a three percent increase in revenue to million from million in and operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million in base contract maintenance revenue increased two percent despite a modest decline in customer retention 
improving customer retention is a top operational priority 
management believes it also represents a significant and achievable opportunity  with current rates at least full percentage points below the company s long term expectations 
the company believes that improvements in retention will be driven by improved procedures related to customer communications  landscape inspections  and problem resolution  combined with more selective targeting of sales prospects 
enhancement revenue eg  add on services such as seasonal flower plantings  mulching  etc  which represents approximately one third of landcare s revenue  grew six percent and was favorably impacted by more consistent focus throughout the country  as well as hurricane related work 
the company believes the investments that it has made in this business  including the development of a systematically stronger and larger sales organization that is better qualified  trained and equipped  will position it well to realize the substantial growth potential in this business 
operating results improved by almost million 
the increase in profit was due to improved labor management techniques  including quicker implementation of reductions in seasonal workforce in the fourth quarter  improvements in safety related costs and the impact of approximately million of branch shut down costs incurred in these profit gains were offset in part by higher fuel prices 
capital employed in the trugreen landcare segment increased one percent 
terminix segment the terminix segment  which includes termite and pest control services  achieved a milestone in by surpassing billion in revenue 
revenue increased six percent to billion from million in while operating income increased percent to million compared to million in strong growth in revenue from initial termite applications termite completions resulted from a solid increase in renewable unit sales 
the unit growth was achieved despite a relatively weak termite swarm season  and reflected benefits derived from investments to increase market penetration  which included branch splits  and the expansion of the sales force in under penetrated territories 
the mix of termite completion sales moved from approximately percent bait and percent liquid at the end of to approximately percent bait and percent liquid at the end of a relatively modest additional shift is expected to occur in the company was encouraged by its ability to maintain pricing of both liquid and bait services  despite the introduction in of a new  lower cost liquid perimeter treatment technique 
solid growth in termite renewal revenues reflected the impact of improved pricing  offset in part by a slight decline in customer retention 
solid growth in pest control revenue primarily reflected the impact of acquisitions  offset in part by a modest decline in retention 
two positive developments meaningfully impacted terminix s results 
in march  the company introduced a new bait option which utilizes an active termiticide from day one  and provides meaningful labor and material cost advantages over the prior bait offering 
labor efficiencies were also realized in the liquid option as a result of the new perimeter treatment technique 
these efficiencies  along with solid revenue growth  enabled operating income to grow percent  despite higher factor costs and the effects of adjustments to prior year damage claim reserves 
in  terminix recorded a million unfavorable correction in estimating prior years termite damage claim reserves 
new termite damage claims continue to trend favorably 
in addition  as previously disclosed  terminix recorded an unrelated million favorable but non recurring adjustment in capital employed in the terminix segment increased three percent  primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions 
american home shield segment the american home shield segment  which provides home warranties to consumers that cover hvac  plumbing and other systems and appliances  reported an eight percent increase in revenue to million from million in  and operating income of million compared to million in  a decrease of one percent 
new warranty contract sales  which are reported as earned revenue over the subsequent twelve month contract period  increased seven percent in a solid increase in customer renewals  which are american home shield s largest source of revenue  was supported by a larger base of renewable customers and an overall improved customer retention rate 
the improvement in retention reflects a favorable mix in customers renewing as well as a reduced level of non renewal contracts due to mortgage refinancings 
american home shield s second largest channel  real estate sales  showed some improvement in the second half of the year  but were adversely impacted throughout the year by weaker home re sales 
consumer sales  american home shield s fastest growing channel  experienced strong double digit growth driven by expanded and more successful targeted direct mail programs 
operating income declined modestly as incremental profits from increased revenue levels were more than offset by higher claim costs associated with summer weather that was much hotter than the generally mild conditions that prevailed in this led to a three percent increase in the rate of service requests  as well as a higher cost per claim  which had a combined adverse impact on operating income of approximately million 
in addition  the company made planned investments in initiatives to increase market penetration and further improve customer retention  both of which should enhance long term growth 
the operating income comparison to last year was positively impacted by a million cumulative negative adjustment to deferred revenue and operating income that was reported in the third quarter of capital employed increased percent primarily reflecting a higher level of cash and marketable securities due to growth in the business and improved market performance 
capital employed at american home shield which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  includes approximately million and million of cash  short term and long term securities at those dates 
the investment income and realized gains losses on these assets are reported as non operating income expense 
other operations segment the other operations segment includes the company s servicemaster clean and merry maids operations as well as its headquarters functions 
revenue in this segment increased eight percent to million in compared with million in on a combined basis  the servicemaster clean and merry maids franchise operations reported revenue growth of eight percent and a strong increase in operating income 
servicemaster clean reported continued strong growth in disaster restoration services along with improved momentum in commercial cleaning 
merry maids continued to experience strong internal revenue growth in its branch operations  along with improving branch profit margins 
the overall segment operating loss for was million compared with million in favorable trending of prior year insurance claims  as well as a strong increase in profits from the franchise businesses  were offset by increases in costs of certain strategic investments 
total initial and recurring franchise fees represented percent and percent of consolidated revenue in and  respectively and direct franchise operating expenses were percent in both and total franchise fee profits comprised percent and percent of consolidated operating income before headquarter overhead in and  respectively 
the portion of total franchise fee profits related to initial fees received from the sales of franchises was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements for all periods 
capital employed in the other operations segment decreased reflecting lower cash balances as the company used existing cash resources as well as cash generated from operations during to fund the tax payments related to the irs agreement and the repayment of million of public debt that matured in april businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations the company intends to sell its american residential services ars and american mechanical services ams companies so it can concentrate resources on its main growth businesses 
the company has retained an investment banking firm to serve as its financial advisor in this process 
the ars ams operations provide heating  ventilation  air conditioning hvac  plumbing and electrical installation and repair services and were previously disclosed as the company s ars ams segment 
because the company intends to sell these companies  their operating results are reported within the financial statement caption businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations for all periods 
revenues from the combined ars and ams businesses increased percent in operating income net of taxes increased by approximately million in  as sharp improvements in volume and mix of replacement sales and more favorable weather conditions offset lower profits from commercial installation projects 
net income from previously discontinued operations totaled million in  primarily reflecting the favorable conclusion of certain obligations related to international pest control businesses sold in prior years 
in  as a result of the comprehensive irs agreement discussed previously  the company recognized a non cash reduction in the tax provision related to discontinued operations  thereby increasing net income reported under that caption by million 
included in the loss of businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations was an impairment charge million pre tax  million after tax associated with the goodwill and intangible assets of the ars and ams operations 
the components of income loss  net of income taxes of businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations for  and are as follows in thousands ars ams operating income headquarter support and insurance costs previously allocated to ars ams ars ams operating income before previously allocated expenses provision for income taxes ars ams operating income  net of tax reduction in tax provision related to irs agreement impairment charge  net of tax other discontinued operations  net of tax income loss from businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations compared with revenue from continuing operations for was billion  a six percent increase over  with approximately five percent of the growth derived from internal sources 
the company reported income from continuing operations in of million and income from businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations of million 
total net income of million in compared with a net loss of million in diluted earnings per share were in and a loss of 
in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were in compared with a loss of 
in as more fully discussed below  the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for included a 
per share million non cash reduction in the tax provision and the amount included a non cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of per diluted share million pre tax  million after tax 
operating income for was million  compared with million in the results include the million non cash impairment charge 
the increase in operating income in reflects the impact of the impairment charge  strong profit growth at american home shield and trugreen chemlawn  a reduced level of operating loss in trugreen landcare and improved profits at servicemaster clean and terminix  as well as a million gain that trugreen chemlawn realized in the third quarter of from the sale of a support facility 
impairment charge in the third quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge associated with the goodwill and intangible assets at its trugreen landcare business unit 
this charge  which is included in the results of continuing operations for  totaled million pre tax  million after tax  and per diluted share 
also in the third quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge associated with the goodwill and intangible assets at its ars and ams operations 
the company is currently holding these operations for sale  accordingly  the financial results for the ars and ams operations  as well as the impairment charge related to these operations million pre tax  million after tax  have been reclassified to businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations for all periods 
operating and non operating expenses cost of services rendered and products sold increased four percent compared to the prior year and decreased as a percentage of revenue to percent in from percent in selling and administrative expenses increased nine percent and increased as a percentage of revenue to percent from percent in the increase in selling and administrative expenses primarily reflects an increased level of variable incentive compensation expense at the headquarters level and increased investments in the sales force  particularly at terminix and american home shield 
net interest expense decreased million from  primarily reflecting the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into at the end of and early  and a slightly higher level of investment income from securities in the american home shield investment portfolio 
it is important to note that investment returns are an integral part of the business model at american home shield  and there will always be some market based variability in the timing and amount of investment returns realized from year to year 
the comparison of the effective tax rate is impacted by the reduction in the tax provision related to the company s agreement with the irs  as well as the impairment charge recorded in the effective tax rate for continuing operations reflects a benefit of percent in and a percent tax expense in as previously discussed  the agreement with the irs resulted in a million non cash reduction in the income tax provision for continuing operations 
the impairment charge reported in continuing operations for included a portion of goodwill that was not deductible for tax purposes  resulting in a tax benefit of million  or only approximately percent of the pre tax impairment charge of million 
segment review vs 
key performance indicators as of december  trugreen chemlawn growth in full program contracts customer retention rate terminix growth in pest control customers pest control customer retention rate growth in termite customers termite customer retention rate american home shield growth in warranty contracts customer retention rate trugreen chemlawn segment the trugreen chemlawn segment reported revenue of million in  eight percent above operating income was million in compared to million in included in the results was a million pre tax gain from the sale of a support facility 
the growth in revenue was supported by an eight percent increase in customer counts  with five percent of that growth from organic sources and three percent from acquisitions 
the organic customer count growth reflected continued significant improvement in customer retention  partially offset by a modest decline in new sales 
the customer retention improvement of basis points in was geographically broad based  resulting from programs implemented to improve customer communications and problem resolution  initiatives to produce more visible results  focused incentive compensation structures at all levels  and more favorable weather conditions 
since  the retention rate has improved by basis points  reflecting management s concerted focus on customer satisfaction 
management is encouraged with the progress trugreen chemlawn has made in diversifying its marketing model  further reducing its reliance on telemarketing 
overall  new sales in were down less than two percent  reflecting a decline in telemarketing sales as a result of new restrictions  including implementation of the national do not call registry  offset by a substantial increase in sales from new channels such as neighborhood sales efforts and direct mail 
in april  trugreen chemlawn acquired the assets of greenspace services limited greenspace  canada s largest professional lawn care service company 
operating income increased nine percent  with approximately three percent of the increase related to the million gain realized from the sale of a support facility in the third quarter 
operating income margins improved slightly  reflecting the impact of the support facility gain  partially offset by increased fuel and chemical costs as well as increased variable incentive compensation costs 
capital employed increased two percent  reflecting acquisitions  offset in part by improved working capital management 
trugreen landcare segment the trugreen landcare segment reported revenue of million in  comparable to levels 
the segment reported an operating loss of million  compared with an operating loss of million in during the third quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million pre tax  relating to goodwill and intangible assets of its trugreen landcare operations 
for a further discussion of the impairment charge see the goodwill and intangible assets section in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in segment operating income reflects the impact of the impairment charge as well as a reduced level of operating losses experienced in revenue was consistent with levels  reflecting a stronger volume of enhancement sales eg  add on services such as seasonal flower plantings  mulching  etc 
and a comparable level of base contract maintenance revenue  offset by the effects of branch consolidations and closures that were completed in late and early excluding the impact of branch consolidations  revenue increased two percent 
the growth in enhancement revenue reflects the impact of focused sales efforts and an improving economy 
the level of operating loss improved  reflecting the favorable grow over effects of the impairment charge  an increased level of enhancement sales  and an improvement in materials expense 
these items were offset in part by a weather related reduction in high margin snow removal revenue and higher variable incentive compensation and fuel costs 
capital employed decreased percent  reflecting improved working capital management supported by a program to reduce underutilized equipment 
terminix segment the terminix segment reported a five percent increase in revenue to million from million in and operating income of million compared to million  a one percent increase 
entering  terminix was making significant changes to its operating model with the implementation of a dual service offering for termites and the migration in pest control from monthly to quarterly service frequency 
with the improved efficacy of liquid termite treatments  the company began providing consumers with the choice of receiving termite services through baiting systems or liquid treatments 
as previously disclosed  with this enhanced termite offering  the company anticipated and did experience a shift in the mix of its termite customer base from bait to liquid 
while the estimated lifetime values of these two types of offerings are comparable  the earnings cycles are different with liquid customers having less first year revenues and profits but more profitability in subsequent years 
by offering consumers a choice in treatments  terminix was able to increase the average price realized for each of the two treatment alternatives  thus helping to offset the adverse  short term revenue and profit impacts of the mix shift 
the mix of new termite sales termite completions  which represent about a quarter of terminix s total revenue  moved from approximately percent bait and percent liquid at the end of to approximately percent bait and percent liquid at the end of as a result  overall termite completion revenue increased only modestly in  even though the company achieved solid double digit unit growth in sales and improved price realization for each treatment alternative viewed discreetly 
termite renewal revenues experienced strong growth  supported by improved pricing 
pest control revenue increased modestly as high single digit growth in customer counts  attributable in part to a basis point improvement in retention  was partially offset by the unfavorable impact to revenues from the increased number of customers receiving quarterly service visits versus monthly service visits 
the company believes this shift has had a positive impact on improving customer satisfaction and has already caused and should continue to lead to improved labor efficiencies 
operating income grew modestly as the projected termite mix shift did have a negative effect on first year gross profit 
operating income was also adversely impacted by higher insurance  fuel  and bad debt costs  as well as the costs associated with a procedural change in the branches to ensure that termite renewal reinspections occur before the actual renewal payments are due 
in  the company recorded a final adjustment to reflect positive trending in damage claim costs associated with the sears termite customer base acquired several years ago 
this resulted in an million reduction in expense in  compared with a million reduction in in the fourth quarter of  terminix corrected its method of recognizing renewal revenue from certain customers who have prepaid 
a cumulative adjustment was recorded reducing fourth quarter revenue by million and operating income by million 
capital employed in the terminix segment increased six percent  primarily reflecting acquisitions 
american home shield segment the american home shield segment reported an eight percent increase in revenue to million from million in  and operating income growth of percent to million compared to million in renewal sales  which are american home shield s largest source of revenue  experienced solid growth  reflecting management s specific programs to improve satisfaction and retention 
real estate sales  which are the second largest channel  had slight growth with volume negatively impacted by strong declines in home listings in high warranty usage states like california and texas 
and consumer sales  which are the smallest but fastest growing channel  experienced very strong double digit growth  reflecting an increased level of direct mail solicitations 
american home shield s total new contract sales in the fourth quarter increased three percent  a rate less than the full year growth rate of six percent due in part to the relative timing of direct mail solicitations 
operating income increased  reflecting the effects of revenue growth and continued very strong controls over claim costs 
partially offsetting these factors were continuing investments to increase market penetration and customer retention 
in  american home shield is planning to continue its efforts to expand sales in less established real estate markets by expanding its sales force  improving training  and reducing the span of control of sales force supervisors 
these efforts are intended to drive a replication of the results of high performing account executives 
management is also focusing on continuing to improve customer satisfaction and retention through enhanced customer communications 
in the third quarter of  american home shield recorded a cumulative  non cash negative adjustment to revenue and operating income of approximately million related to the conversion from a historically manual deferred revenue calculation to an automated computation 
in the fourth quarter of  american home shield recorded a cumulative adjustment of a comparable amount related to a correction in its method of recognizing revenue from customers who have prepaid 
capital employed increased percent reflecting a higher level of cash and marketable securities due to the growth in the business and improved market performance 
the calculation of capital employed for the american home shield segment includes approximately million and million of cash  short term and long term securities at december  and  respectively 
the interest and realized gains losses on these investments are reported as non operating income expense 
other operations segment the other operations segment reported an eight percent increase in revenue to million in compared with million in on a combined basis  the servicemaster clean and merry maids franchise operations reported revenue growth of percent and a solid increase in operating income 
servicemaster clean continued to experience strong growth in disaster restoration services 
at merry maids  a better economy and improved sales processes have driven steady increases in internal revenue growth in both the branch and franchise operations 
the segment s operating loss increased over the prior year  primarily reflecting a higher level of variable incentive compensation expense at the headquarters level  partially offset by increased profits in the franchise operations 
total initial and recurring franchise fees represented percent and percent of consolidated revenue in and  respectively and direct franchise operating expenses were percent and percent of consolidated operating expenses in and  respectively 
total franchise fee profits comprised percent and percent of consolidated operating income excluding the impairment charge in before headquarter overhead in and  respectively 
the portion of total franchise fee profits related to initial fees received from the sales of franchises was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements for all periods 
capital employed in the other operations segment increased primarily reflecting the deferred tax assets recorded at the conclusion of the irs review 
financial position and liquidity cash flows from operating activities net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared to million in this decrease primarily reflects the tax payment impacts resulting from the irs agreement 
related to this agreement  the company realized tax savings of million in  made tax payments in early totaling million and realized a million reduction in estimated tax payments in the third and fourth quarters of additionally  this agreement resulted in a deferred tax annuity totaling million that will be realized through excluding the impact of the irs agreement  cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  approximately percent higher than net income from continuing operations  and million in this amount was favorably impacted by a non sustainable reduction in payments of incentive compensation in related to the year totaling approximately million 
three factors contribute to the company s strength in its annual cash provided from operating activities a solid earnings base  businesses that need relatively little working capital to fund growth in their operations  and significant annual deferred taxes 
the company receives a significant annual cash tax benefit due to a large base of amortizable intangible assets which exist for income tax reporting purposes  but not for book purposes 
a significant portion of these assets arose in connection with the conversion from a limited partnership to a corporation 
the agreement with the irs affirmed the previously identified step up in the tax basis of the company s assets which occurred upon reincorporation 
the amortization of the tax basis will result in approximately million of average annual cash tax benefits through for which no corresponding income statement benefit is recorded 
the company estimates that the divestitures of ars and ams will result in a reduction of approximately million in the average annual cash tax benefits  however  the cash tax benefits in the year of divestiture will increase such that the aggregate tax benefits are unchanged 
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures  which include recurring capital needs and information technology projects  were slightly below prior year levels 
in  the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately million 
the company has no material capital commitments at this time 
acquisitions in totaled million  compared with million in the decrease in acquisitions primarily reflects trugreen chemlawn s purchase of greenspace 
in  the company expects to continue to expand its tuck in acquisition program at both terminix and trugreen chemlawn  with overall acquisitions at these two units higher than the level 
cash flows from financing activities cash dividends paid to shareholders in amounted to 
per share  a percent increase over this was the th consecutive year of annual growth in dividends for the company 
cash dividends paid in totaled million  a two percent increase over  reflecting the per share increase  partially offset by the impact of share repurchases 
in february  the company announced the declaration of a cash dividend of 
per share payable on february  to shareholders of record on february  the company expects to continue to increase its per share dividend payment although  as previously disclosed  at a rate lower than its corresponding growth in profits 
the timing and amount of future dividend increases are at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on  among other things  the company s capital structure objectives and cash requirements 
in february  servicemaster s board of directors authorized million for share repurchases 
this authorization replaces the unused portion million at december  from the previous authorization granted in july in  the company repurchased million of its shares at an average price of approximately per share 
the company anticipates share repurchases in to be in the to million range 
the actual level of future share repurchases will depend on various factors such as the company s commitment to maintain investment grade credit ratings and other strategic investment opportunities 
liquidity cash and short and long term marketable securities totaled approximately million at december   compared with approximately million at december  the company used existing resources and cash generated from operations during to fund the previously disclosed tax payments related to the irs agreement  as well as the repayment of million of public debt that matured in april approximately million of the cash and short and long term marketable securities balance is effectively required to support regulatory requirements at american home shield and for other purposes 
total debt at december  was million  approximately million below the amount at december  and the lowest level since approximately percent of the company s debt matures beyond five years and percent beyond fifteen years 
the company s next significant debt maturity is not until management believes that funds generated from operating activities and other existing resources provide it with significant financial flexibility which will continue to be adequate to satisfy its ongoing working capital needs 
the company maintains a revolving credit facility of million 
in may  this agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to may and reduce by basis points the interest rate payable under the facility 
at december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and had issued approximately million of letters of credit  resulting in unused commitments of approximately million 
the company also has million of senior unsecured debt and equity securities available for issuance under an effective shelf registration statement 
in addition  the company has an arrangement enabling it to sell  on a revolving basis  certain receivables to unrelated third party purchasers 
the agreement is a day facility that is renewable at the option of the purchasers 
the company may sell up to million of its receivables to these purchasers in the future and therefore would have immediate access to cash proceeds from these sales 
the amount of the eligible receivables varies during the year based on seasonality of the business that will at times limit the amount available to the company 
during  there were no receivables sold to third parties under this agreement 
the company is party to a number of debt agreements which require it to maintain certain financial and other covenants  including limitations on indebtedness debt cannot exceed times ebitda  as defined and interest coverage ratio ebitda needs to exceed four times interest expense 
in addition  under certain circumstances  the agreements may limit the company s ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock 
these limitations are not expected to be an inhibiting factor in the company s future dividend and share repurchase plans 
failure by the company to maintain these covenants could result in the acceleration of the maturity of the debt 
at december   and throughout the year  the company was in compliance with the covenants and  based on its operating outlook for  expects to be able to maintain compliance in the future 
the company does not have any debt agreements that contain put rights or provide for acceleration of maturity as a result of a change in credit rating 
the company maintains operating lease facilities with banks totaling million which provide for the acquisition and development of branch properties to be leased by the company 
at december   there was approximately million funded under these facilities 
approximately million of these leases have been included on the balance sheet as assets with related debt as of december  and the remaining funded balances are treated as operating leases 
approximately million of the available facility expires in january and the remaining million expires in september the company has guaranteed the residual value of the properties under the leases up to percent of the fair market value at the commencement of the lease 
at december   the company s residual value guarantee related to the leased assets totaled million for which the company has recorded the estimated fair value of this guarantee approximately million in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the majority of the company s fleet and some equipment is leased through operating leases 
the lease terms are non cancelable for the first twelve month term  and then are month to month  cancelable at the company s option 
there are residual value guarantees ranging from percent to percent depending on the agreement on these vehicles and equipment  which historically have not resulted in significant net payments to the lessors 
at december   there were approximately million of residual value guarantees relating to the company s fleet and equipment leases 
the fair value of the assets under the leases is expected to fully mitigate the company s obligations under the agreements 
at december  the company has recorded the estimated fair value of this guarantee approximately million in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the following table presents the company s contractual obligations and commitments in millions total yr yrs yrs yrs debt balances non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations telecommunications supply agreements and other other long term liabilities insurance claims businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations other total amount these items are reported in the consolidated statements of financial position not included in the table above are deferred income tax liabilities and the related interest payments on the company s long term debt 
deferred income tax liabilities totaled million and are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

therefore  the company has calculated the expected interest payments on debt outstanding as of december  to be approximately million  million  million  million  million and million in      and thereafter  respectively 
financial position continuing operations receivables increased from prior year levels  reflecting a higher amount of credit sales at american home shield and an increased level of fourth quarter snow removal receivables at trugreen landcare 
inventory levels increased reflecting a new vendor relationship at terminix  as well as general business growth 
deferred customer acquisition costs were consistent with prior year levels 
the company capitalizes sales commissions and other direct contract acquisition costs relating to termite baiting and pest contracts  as well as home warranty agreements 
these costs vary with and are directly related to a new sale 
property and equipment declined slightly 
the company does not have any material capital commitments at this time 
the increase in accounts payable reflects a lengthening of payment terms resulting from improvements in the company s processes 
the decrease in income taxes payable at december  primarily reflects the february federal tax payment related to the irs agreement 
deferred revenue increased  reflecting growth in warranty contracts written at american home shield  partially offset by lower levels of deferred revenue at terminix associated with the new termite bait product and the increased mix of liquid applications 
the company has minority investors in terminix 
this minority ownership reflects an interest issued to the former owners of the allied bruce terminix companies in connection with the acquisition of that entity 
at any time  the former owners may convert this equity security into eight million servicemaster common shares 
the servicemaster shares are included in the shares used for the calculation of diluted earnings per share whenever their inclusion has a dilutive impact 
subsequent to december   servicemaster has the ability to require conversion of the security into servicemaster common shares  provided the closing share price of servicemaster s common stock averages at least per share for consecutive trading days 
total shareholders equity was billion and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase primarily reflects operating profits in the business offset in part by cash dividend payments and share repurchases 
under federal tax rules  dividends are considered taxable only when paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits as defined under federal tax laws 
as a result of its december reincorporation  the company only began generating corporate earnings and profits for tax purposes in since  earnings and profits for tax purposes have been reduced by dividend payments  amortization of intangible assets for tax reporting  deductions relating to business closures and the timing of certain other tax related items 
the company currently expects that approximately percent of its dividends on common stock will be taxable as dividend income for federal income tax purposes 
this is lower than the previously disclosed taxability percentage for dividends of percent  primarily due to one time effects of the pending dispositions 
the estimate is subject to change  based on the outcome of future events 
any portion of the dividend that is not taxable would be treated as a return of capital and would generally be applied to reduce the cost basis of the shares 
the company expects that the taxable portion of its dividend will rebound sharply in  and grow to be fully taxable over the succeeding few years 
financial position businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations the assets and liabilities related to businesses held pending sale and discontinued businesses have been classified in a separate caption on the consolidated statements of financial position 
assets from the businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations have increased  reflecting growth in receivables at the american residential services ars and american mechanical services ams businesses 
the increase in liabilities from businesses held pending sale and discontinued operations represents increases in payables and other current liabilities at the ars and ams businesses  partially offset by reductions associated with the favorable conclusion of certain obligations related to the previously sold international pest control operations 
the remaining liabilities primarily represent payables and other current liabilities at the businesses held pending sale and obligations related to long term self insurance claims 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions required under generally accepted accounting principles which may differ from actual results 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the allowance for receivables  accruals for self insured retention limits related to medical  workers compensation  auto and general liability insurance claims  accruals for home warranty claims  the possible outcomes of outstanding litigation  accruals for income tax liabilities as well as deferred tax accounts  the deferral and amortization of customer acquisition costs  useful lives for depreciation and amortization expense and the valuation of tangible and intangible assets 
the allowance for receivables is developed based on several factors including overall customer credit quality  historical write off experience and specific account analyses that project the ultimate collectibility of the outstanding balance 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to vary 
the company carries insurance policies on insurable risks at levels which it believes to be appropriate  including workers compensation  auto and general liability risks 
the company has self insured retention limits and insured layers of excess insurance coverage above those limits 
accruals for self insurance losses and warranty claims in the american home shield business are made based on the company s claims experience and actuarial projections 
current activity could differ causing a change in estimates 
the company has certain liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims  lawsuits  and other proceedings 
the company accrues for these liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
any resulting adjustments  which could be material  are recorded in the period identified 
the company records deferred income tax balances based on the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes 
there are significant amortizable intangible assets for tax reporting purposes not for financial reporting purposes which arose as a result of the company s reincorporation from partnership to corporate form in the company records its deferred tax items based on the estimated value of the tax basis 
the company adjusts tax estimates when required to reflect changes based on factors such as changes in tax laws  results of tax authority reviews and statutory limitations 
fixed assets  and intangible assets with finite lives  are depreciated and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
these lives are based on the company s previous experience for similar assets  potential market obsolescence  and other industry and business data 
the company also periodically reviews the assets for impairment and a loss would be recorded if and when the company determined that the book value of the asset exceeded its fair value 
changes in the estimated useful lives or in asset values would cause the company to adjust its book value or future expense accordingly 
the company reviews its goodwill and trade names at least once a year for impairment 
an impairment loss would be recorded if and when the company determines that the expected present value of the future cash flows deemed to be derived from the asset is less than its corresponding book value 
as permitted under sfas  the company carries forward a reporting unit s valuation from the most recent valuation under the following conditions the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value calculation  the most recent fair value calculation resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin  and based on the facts and circumstances of events that have occurred since the last fair value determination  the likelihood that a current fair value calculation would result in an impairment would be remote 
for the goodwill and trade name impairment review  the company carried forward the valuations for all reporting units except ars 
a valuation analysis performed for ars indicated no impairment issue 
revenue from lawn care  pest control  liquid and fumigation termite applications  as well as heating air conditioning and plumbing services are recognized as the services are provided 
revenue from landscaping services are recognized as they are earned based upon monthly contract arrangements or when services are performed for non contractual arrangements 
revenue from the company s commercial installation contracts  primarily relating to hvac and electrical installations are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio that total incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
the company eradicates termites through the use of baiting stations  as well as through non baiting methods eg  fumigation or liquid treatments 
termite services using baiting stations  as well as home warranty services  frequently are sold through annual contracts for a one time  upfront payment 
direct costs of these contracts service costs for termite contracts and claim costs for warranty contracts are expensed as incurred 
the company recognizes revenue over the life of these contracts in proportion to the expected direct costs 
revenue from trade name licensing arrangements is recognized when earned 
franchised revenue consists principally of monthly fee revenue  which is recognized when the related customer level revenue is reported by the franchisee and collectibility is assured 
franchise revenue also includes initial fees resulting from the sale of franchises 
these fees are fixed and are recognized as revenue when collectibility is assured and all material services or conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed 
customer acquisition costs  which are incremental and direct costs of obtaining a customer  are deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract in proportion to revenue recognized 
these costs include sales commissions and direct selling costs which can be shown to have resulted in a successful sale 
newly issued accounting statements and positions in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that stock options and share grants be recorded at fair value and this value is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the statement requires that compensation expense be recorded for newly issued awards as well as the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding as of the effective date of this statement 
the provisions of this statement become effective beginning with the company s fiscal year january  
the company had previously disclosed that it had expected to restate prior periods as if this statement were in effect for all periods 
as permitted by this statement  the company will instead prospectively apply the provisions of this statement effective january  the company currently estimates that the adoption of this statement will reduce earnings per share in by approximately 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the economy and its impact on discretionary consumer spending  labor wages  fuel prices  home re sales  unemployment rates  insurance costs and medical inflation rates could be significant to future operating earnings 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has entered into specific financial arrangements  primarily fuel hedges  in the normal course of business to manage certain market risks  with a policy of matching positions and limiting the terms of contracts to relatively short durations 
the effect of derivative financial instrument transactions is not material to the company s financial statements 
in december and january  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
under the terms of these agreements  the company pays a floating rate of interest based on a specified spread over six month libor on the notional amount and the company receives a fixed rate of interest at percent on the notional amount 
the impact of these swap transactions was to convert million of the company s debt from a fixed rate of percent to a variable rate based on libor percent average rate during 
the company generally maintains the majority of its debt at fixed rates 
after considering the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  approximately percent of total recorded debt at december  was at a fixed rate 
the following table summarizes information about the company s fixed rate debt as of december  after considering the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  including the principal cash payments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was approximately million at december expected maturity date in millions there after total fixed rate debt avg 
rate with respect to other obligations  the payments on the approximately million of funding outstanding under the company s real estate operating lease facilities as well as its fleet and equipment operating leases approximately million in residual value guarantee are tied to floating interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest expense based on floating rates is partially offset by floating rate investment income earned on cash and marketable securities 
the company believes its overall exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not material to its overall results of operations 
the company has several debt and lease agreements where the interest rate or rent payable under the agreements automatically adjusts based on changes in the company s credit ratings 
while the company is not currently expecting a change in its credit ratings  based on amounts outstanding at december   a one rating category improvement in the company s credit ratings would reduce annual expense by approximately million 
a one rating category reduction in the company s credit ratings would increase annual expense by approximately million
