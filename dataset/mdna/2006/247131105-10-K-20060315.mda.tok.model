the excess workers compensation insurance reserves carried in the consolidated financial statements are calculated in accordance with gaap and  net of reinsurance  are approximately million less than those reported by the company for statutory financial statement purposes at december  this difference is primarily due to the use of different discount factors between gaap and statutory accounting principles and differences in the bases against which such discount factors are applied 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses and note a to the consolidated financial statements for certain additional information regarding reserve assumptions under gaap 
competition the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies both in connection with sales of insurance and asset accumulation products and integrated disability and absence management services and in acquiring blocks of business and companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater asset bases  higher ratings from ratings agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger sales operations 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives 
the company believes that its reputation in the marketplace  quality of service  unique programs which integrate employee benefit products and absence management services and investment returns have enabled it to compete effectively for new business in its targeted markets 
the company reacts to changes in the marketplace generally by focusing on products with adequate margins and attempting to avoid those with low margins 
the company believes that its smaller size  relative to some of its competitors  enables it to more easily tailor its products to the demands of customers 
regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they conduct business 
these regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by the company s insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments these subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries business  including  for example  risk based capital rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are required under these regulations to file detailed annual financial reports with the supervisory agencies in the various states in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination at any time by these agencies 
to date  no examinations have produced any significant adverse findings or adjustments 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states 
in april  the new york state attorney general nyag initiated an investigation into certain insurance broker compensation arrangements and other aspects of dealings between insurance brokers and insurance companies  and  in connection therewith  filed a civil complaint in october against a major insurance brokerage firm  marsh mclennan  based on certain of such firm s compensation arrangements with insurers and alleged misconduct in connection with the placement of insurance business 
other state regulators subsequently announced the commencement of similar investigations and reviews 
as previously disclosed  the company has received administrative subpoenas or similar requests for information from the illinois division of insurance  the missouri department of insurance  the nyag s office and the north carolina department of insurance in connection with their investigations 
the company anticipates that additional regulatory inquiries may be received by its insurance subsidiaries as the various investigations continue 
the company has fully cooperated with inquiries it has received to date  and it intends to fully cooperate with any future inquiries of this type 
as also previously disclosed  based on an internal review in relating to the company s insurance subsidiaries  the company had identified certain potential issues concerning past insurance solicitation practices involving sncc and marsh mclennan 
the instances that the company was able to specifically identify in this regard were limited in number and involved modest amounts of premium 
the company reported on these issues to the nyag s office and to the missouri department of insurance 
in  sncc was the subject of a targeted market conduct examination by the missouri department of insurance relating to these issues  which did not result in any significant adverse findings 
the company will fully cooperate with these and any other regulatory agencies relating to these issues 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of this matter on the company or of the various investigations  or any regulatory changes or litigation resulting from such investigations  on the insurance industry or on the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
from time to time  increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework  and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter  and in many cases increase  state authority to regulate insurance companies 
in addition to legislative initiatives of this type  the national association of insurance commissioners the naic and insurance regulators are continuously involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
furthermore  while the federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal legislation and administrative policies in a number of areas  such as employee benefits regulation  age  sex and disability based discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly affect the insurance business 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on the operations of the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
the naic s rbc requirements for insurance companies take into account asset risks  insurance risks  interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to the insurer s business and specify varying degrees of regulatory action to occur to the extent that an insurer does not meet the specified rbc thresholds  with increasing degrees of regulatory scrutiny or intervention provided for companies in categories of lesser rbc compliance 
the company believes that its insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the rbc requirements and that the thresholds will not have any significant regulatory effect on the company 
however  were the insurance subsidiaries rbc position to materially decline in the future  the insurance subsidiaries continued ability to pay dividends and the degree of regulatory supervision or control to which they are subjected may be affected 
the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most solvency or guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s financial strength and  in most instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
sncc did not recognize any expense in and recognized expense of million and million in and  respectively  for these types of assessments 
none of the company s life insurance subsidiaries has ever incurred any significant costs of this nature 
employees the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons at december  the company believes that it enjoys good relations with its employees 
other subsidiaries the company conducts certain of its investment management activities through its wholly owned subsidiary  delphi capital management  inc dcm  and makes certain investments through other wholly owned non insurance subsidiaries 
other transactions during  the company entered into various reinsurance agreements with oracle reinsurance company ltd 
oracle re  a wholly owned subsidiary of delphi international ltd 
delphi international  an independent bermuda insurance holding company 
in october  oracle re and the company effected the commutation of these reinsurance agreements  pursuant to which oracle re paid approximately million to the company net of million which had been held by the company related to the reserves ceded to oracle re under such agreements 
these transactions did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or net income 
in furtherance of the commutation of the reinsurance agreements  the company agreed to waive a portion of the amounts due to the company under certain subordinated notes issued by delphi international 
as a result of this waiver  the company recognized a pre tax loss of million in for the other than temporary decline in the value of these notes 
in march  delphi international repaid the adjusted amounts due under the subordinated notes and the company did not realize any significant additional loss in connection with such repayment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company liquidated a substantial majority of the investments of its investment subsidiaries 
the proceeds from these sales were used in to repay million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facilities  to repurchase million liquidation amount of the capital securities of its subsidiary  delphi funding llc the capital securities  and to repurchase million principal amount of its senior notes which matured in october the matured senior notes 
in may  the company issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes in a public offering 
the proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and to repay in full the principal amount of million of the matured senior notes 
the senior notes  which were issued at par value  will mature on may  and are redeemable at par at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after may  the senior notes are not redeemable at the option of any holder of the notes prior to maturity nor are they entitled to any sinking fund redemptions 
interest on the senior notes is payable quarterly on february  may  august and november of each year 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and  as such  are effectively subordinated to all claims of secured creditors of the company and its subsidiaries and to claims of unsecured creditors of the company s subsidiaries  including the insurance subsidiaries obligations to policyholders 
as a result of the issuance of the senior notes  under the terms of the company s previous revolving credit facility  the maximum amount of borrowings available to the company thereunder was reduced from million to million and the facility was converted to an unsecured facility  with collateral being released to the company 
the senior notes were issued in denominations of and multiples of and are listed on the new york stock exchange 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  delphi financial statutory trust i the trust  a subsidiary of the company  issued million liquidation amount of floating rate capital securities the capital securities in a private placement 
in connection with the issuance of the capital securities and the related purchase by the company of all of the common securities of the trust the common securities and  collectively with the capital securities  the trust securities  the company issued million principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures  due the junior debentures 
interest on the junior debentures is payable quarterly on february  may  august and november of each year 
the interest rate on the junior debentures resets quarterly to a rate equal to the london interbank offered interest rate libor for three month us dollar deposits  plus not to exceed 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding advances was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the distribution and other payment dates on the trust securities correspond to the interest and other payment dates on the junior debentures 
the junior debentures are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of the company s existing and future senior indebtedness 
beginning in may  the company will have the right to redeem the junior debentures  in whole or in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
in may  the company entered into a new million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent  and a group of major banking institutions the credit agreement  which replaced the existing million revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in december the company had outstanding borrowings of million under the credit agreement at december  and million of outstanding borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility at december  interest on borrowings under the credit agreement is payable  at the company s election  either at a floating rate based on libor plus a specified margin which varies depending on the level of the specified ratings of the company s senior unsecured debt  as in effect from time to time  or at bank of america s prime rate 
certain commitment and utilization fees are also payable under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and various other affirmative and negative covenants considered ordinary for this type of credit agreement 
they include  among others  the maintenance of a specified debt to capital ratio  minimum consolidated net worth of the company  minimum risk based capital requirements for the company s insurance subsidiaries  rslic and sncc  and certain limitations on investments and subsidiary indebtedness 
as of december   the company was in compliance in all material respects with the financial and various other affirmative and negative covenants in the credit agreement 
the maturity date of the credit agreement is may  during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to exit its non core property catastrophe reinsurance business  due to the volatility associated with such business and other strategic considerations  and has not thereafter entered into or renewed any assumed property reinsurance contracts 
the company has classified the operating results of this business as discontinued operations 
see note s to the consolidated financial statements 
a substantial majority of these reinsurance contracts expired on or before december  and all of the remaining contracts will expire prior to the end of the third quarter of although the company will continue to collect modest amounts of premium and pay losses under the terms of the remaining contracts until their expiration  these amounts are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized premium income of million  million  and million  respectively  and incurred losses of million  million  and million  respectively  from this line of business 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized operating loss income of million  million  and million  respectively  net of income tax benefit expense of million  million  and million  respectively  from this business 
the assets and liabilities related to the property catastrophe reinsurance business were not material to the company s consolidated financial position 
item a 
risk factors 
reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate 
the company s reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimates 
see critical accounting policies and estimates future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process 
these estimates are subject to variability  since the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
moreover  under the actuarial methodologies discussed previously  these estimates are subject to reevaluation based on developing trends with respect to the company s loss experience 
such trends may emerge over longer periods of time  and changes in such trends cannot necessarily be identified or predicted at any given time by reference to current claims experience  whether favorable or unfavorable 
if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the market values of the company s investments fluctuate 
the market values of the company s investments vary depending on economic and market conditions  including interest rates  and such values can decline as a result of changes in such conditions 
increasing interest rates or a widening in the spread between interest rates available on us treasury securities and corporate debt  for example  will typically have an adverse impact on the market values of the fixed maturity securities in the company s investment portfolio 
if interest rates decline  the company generally achieves a lower overall rate of return on investments of cash generated from the company s operations 
in addition  in the event that investments are called or mature in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates 
the company may also in the future be required or determine to sell certain investments  whether to meet contractual obligations to its policyholders  or otherwise  at a price and a time when the market value of such investments is less than the book value of such investments 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
see critical accounting policies and estimates investments 
in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a description of management s evaluation process 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience losses from other than temporary declines in security values 
such losses are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement 
see results of operations compared to in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company invests in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in various financial instruments 
these investments are reflected in the company s financial statements under the equity method  accordingly  positive or negative changes in the value of the investees financial instruments are included in net investment income 
thus  the company s results of operations  in addition to its liquidity and financial condition  could be materially adversely affected if these entities were to experience significant losses in the values of their financial assets 
the company s investment strategy exposes the company to default and other risks 
the management of the company s investment portfolio is an important component of the company s profitability since a substantial portion of the company s operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and  in the case of asset accumulation products  the interest credited on policyholder funds and  in the case of the company s other products for which reserves are discounted  the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
see liquidity and capital resources investments 
in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a description of the company s investment portfolio and strategy 
the company is subject to the risk  among others  that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities the company owns will default on principal and interest payments 
a major economic downturn or any of the various other factors that affect issuers abilities to pay could result in issuer defaults 
because the company s investments consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and short term investments  such defaults could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
the company s financial position exposes the company to interest rate risks 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products 
see liquidity and capital resources asset liability management and market risk 
in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company manages this risk by seeking to adjust the prices charged for these products 
the company s ability to reduce its exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the company transfers its exposure to some risks through reinsurance arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
under the company s reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
at december  and  the company had reinsurance receivables of million and million  respectively 
the availability  amount  cost and terms of reinsurance may vary significantly based on market conditions 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance will increase the company s risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will  absent a decrease in the reinsurance amount  reduce the company s premium income 
in either case  the company s operating results could be adversely affected unless it is able to accordingly adjust the prices or other terms of its insurance policies or successfully implement other operational initiatives  as to which no assurance can be given 
furthermore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurance 
the company obtains reinsurance primarily through indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the company is still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurers fail to meet their financial obligations 
such failures could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
some reinsurers experienced significant losses related to the terrorist events of september  as a result of this and other market factors  higher prices and less favorable terms and conditions continue to be offered in the reinsurance market 
these market conditions are reflected in the terms of the replacement reinsurance arrangements entered into during and remaining in effect for the company s excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
see liquidity and capital resources reinsurance 
in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the future  the company s reinsurers may continue to seek price increases  although the extent of any such increases cannot currently be predicted 
also  there has been significantly reduced availability of reinsurance covering risks such as terrorist and catastrophic events 
accordingly  substantially all of the company s coverages of this nature were discontinued during  which would result in the company retaining a higher portion of losses from such events if they occur 
the company has not been able to replace such coverages on acceptable terms due to present market conditions  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
however  under the terrorism act  which terminates on december   the federal government will pay of the company s covered losses during and of the company s covered losses during  relating to acts of international terrorism from property and casualty products directly written by sncc above the company s annual deductible 
see business group employee benefit products 
the occurrence of a significant catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the insurance business is a heavily regulated industry 
the company s insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the other states in which they conduct business 
such regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by such subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments such subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries businesses  including  for example  rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products  claims handling practices and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states

the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater assets  higher ratings from rating agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger agency sales operations than the company 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives 
the company may be adversely impacted by a decline in the ratings of its insurance subsidiaries or its own credit ratings 
ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor impacting the competitive position of insurance companies 
the financial strength ratings of rslic as of february as assigned by am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s were a excellent  a strong  a good and a strong  respectively 
the financial strength ratings of sncc as of february as assigned by am best  fitch and standard poor s were a excellent  a strong and a strong  respectively 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings of companies periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained or improved in the future 
claims paying and financial strength ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
downgrades in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of their products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations 
in addition  downgrades in the company s credit ratings could materially adversely affect its ability to access the capital markets 
the company s senior unsecured debt ratings as of february from am best  fitch  moody s and standard poor s were bbb  bbb  baa and bbb  respectively

item legal proceedings in the course of its business  the company is a party to litigation and other proceedings  primarily involving its insurance operations 
in some cases  these proceedings entail claims against the company for punitive damages and similar types of relief 
the ultimate disposition of such pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
in addition  incident to its discontinued products  the company has been and is currently a party to various arbitrations arising out of accident and health reinsurance arrangements in which it and other companies formerly were participating reinsurers 
during the second quarter of  the company  along with other former participants  reached a settlement resolving the matters in dispute in one of these arbitrations  and a favorable determination in another such arbitration was rendered during the third quarter of the company increased its reserves related to the reinsurance business in dispute in the settled arbitration by a total of million during the year ended december  the company believes that it has substantial defenses upon which to contest the claims made in the remaining arbitration  although it is not possible to predict its ultimate outcome

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company  through its subsidiaries  underwrites a diverse portfolio of group employee benefit products  primarily group life  disability  and excess workers compensation insurance 
revenues from this group of products are primarily comprised of earned premiums and investment income 
the profitability of group employee benefit products is affected by  among other things  differences between actual and projected claims experience  the retention of existing customers  product mix and the company s ability to attract new customers  change premium rates and contract terms and control administrative expenses 
the company transfers its exposure to some group employee benefit risks through reinsurance ceded arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
accordingly  the profitability of the company s group employee benefit products is affected by the amount  cost and terms of reinsurance it obtains 
the profitability of certain group employee benefit products is also affected by the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
the company is continuing to experience favorable market conditions for its excess workers compensation products due to high primary workers compensation rates 
for its other group employee benefit products  the company is maintaining its underwriting discipline under competitive market conditions and is continuing to increase the size of its sales force in order to enhance its focus on the small case niche insured groups of to individuals  including employers which are first time providers of these employee benefits  which it believes to offer opportunities for superior profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to exit its non core property catastrophe reinsurance business  due to the volatility associated with such business and other strategic considerations  and has not thereafter renewed or written any new reinsurance contracts in this business 
accordingly  the company reclassified the operating results of this business as discontinued operations 
prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
see results of operations compared to loss income from discontinued operations 
the company also operates an asset accumulation business that focuses primarily on offering fixed annuities to individuals 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation business consist of new annuity sales  which are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
revenues from the company s asset accumulation business are primarily comprised of investment income earned on the funds under management 
the profitability of asset accumulation products is primarily dependent on the spread achieved between the return on investments and the interest credited to annuity holders 
the company is disciplined in setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products in an effort to achieve its targeted interest rate spreads on these products  and is willing to accept lower levels of sales on these products when market conditions make these targeted spreads more difficult to achieve 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized

the company from time to time engages in discussions with respect to acquiring blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are their contractual obligations to policyholders and other financing sources 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of these subsidiaries 
the company actively manages its investment portfolio to match its invested assets and related liabilities 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
see asset liability management and market risk 
therefore  the company believes that these sources of funding will be adequate for its insurance subsidiaries to satisfy on both a short term and long term basis these contractual obligations throughout their estimated or stated period 
however  if such contractual obligations were to arise more rapidly or in greater amounts than anticipated in the company s asset liability matching analysis  the company could be required to sell securities earlier than anticipated  potentially resulting in the realization of capital losses particularly  as regards fixed income securities  in a rising interest rate environment  or to borrow funds from available credit sources  in order to fund the payment of such obligations 
in any of such events  the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
cash flows 
operating activities increased cash by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net investing activities used million of cash during primarily for the purchase of securities  and financing activities provided million of cash principally due to the increase in borrowings under the credit agreement  partially offset by the repayment of certain federal home loan bank advances 
share repurchase program 
the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program 
share repurchases are effected by the company in the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of execution of the share repurchase program is based on management s assessment of market conditions for its common stock and other potential uses of capital 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its class a common stock for a total cost of million with a volume weighted average price of per share 
at december   the repurchase of approximately million shares remained authorized under this program 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy emphasizes safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  by focusing on  among other things  managing the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and seeking to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio  which totaled  million at december   primarily consists of investments in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  investments in limited partnerships and short term investments 
during  the market value of the company s investment portfolio  in relation to its amortized cost  decreased by million from year end  before related changes in the cost of business acquired of million and the income tax provision of million 
in addition  the company recognized pre tax net investment gains of million in the weighted average credit rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio as rated by standard poor s corporation was aa at december  while the investment grade rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio addresses credit risk  it does not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
at december   approximately of the company s total invested assets were comprised of corporate fixed maturity securities 
eighty two percent of the company s corporate fixed maturity portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities are distributed among the various rating categories as follows aaa  aa  a  and bbb 
corporate fixed maturity securities subject the company to credit risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk 
to reduce its exposure to corporate credit risk  the company diversifies its investments across economic sectors  industry classes and issuers 
mortgage backed securities comprised of the company s total invested assets at december  ninety seven percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
the company  through its insurance subsidiaries  maintains a program in which investments are financed using advances from various federal home loan banks 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the investments purchased with those funds 
at december   the company had an outstanding advance of million 
the advance was obtained at a fixed rate and has a term to maturity of years 
during  million of federal home loan bank advances matured and were repaid by the company 
in addition  the company has from time to time utilized reverse repurchase agreements  futures and option contracts and interest rate and credit default swaps in connection with its investment strategy 
these transactions may require the company to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral 
as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes  the company may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to it 
the company also maintains a securities lending program under which certain securities from its portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
the company maintains full ownership rights to the securities loaned and continues to earn interest and dividends on them 
the collateral received for securities loaned is recorded at the fair value of the collateral  which is generally in an amount in excess of the market value of the securities loaned 
the company s institutional lending agent monitors the market value of the securities loaned and obtains additional collateral as necessary 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the types and amounts of investments made by the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the company s credit agreement also contains limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management and market risk 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products and the discount rate used to calculate reserves on the company s other products 
in its asset liability matching process  the company determines and monitors on a quarterly basis the duration of its insurance liabilities in the aggregate and the duration of the investment portfolio supporting such liabilities in order to ensure that the difference between such durations  or the duration gap  remains below an internally specified maximum  and similarly determines and monitors the duration gap as between its interest sensitive liabilities  substantially all of which consist of its asset accumulation products  and the components of its investment portfolio supporting such liabilities in relation to a separate internally specified maximum 
as of december   the company maintained these duration gaps within the aforementioned maximums 
in addition  the company  at times  has utilized futures and option contracts and interest rate or credit default swap agreements primarily to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of its fixed maturity portfolio 
at december   the company had no material outstanding futures or option contracts or interest rate or credit default swap agreements 
the company  at times  may also invest in non dollar denominated fixed maturity securities that expose it to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  and therefore  may hedge such exposure by using currency forward contracts 
the company s investment in non dollar denominated fixed maturity securities during was less than of total invested assets 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
these analyses enable the company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest rate sensitive financial instruments due to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on these analyses  if interest rates were to immediately increase by from their year end levels  the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets  net of corresponding changes in the fair value of cost of business acquired and insurance and investment related liabilities  would decline by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  these analyses incorporate numerous assumptions and estimates and assume no changes in the composition of the company s investment portfolio in reaction to such interest rate changes 
consequently  the results of this analysis will likely be materially different from the actual changes in the value of the company s assets that will be experienced under given interest rate scenarios 
the company manages the composition of its borrowed capital by considering factors such as the ratio of borrowed capital to total capital  future debt requirements  the interest rate environment and other market conditions 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt which matures in as compared to an increase of million at december  because interest expense on the company s floating rate corporate debt that was outstanding at december  would have fluctuated as prevailing interest rates changed  changes in market interest rates would not have materially affected its fair value 
reinsurance 
the company cedes portions of the risks relating to its group employee benefit products under indemnity reinsurance agreements with various unaffiliated reinsurers 
the company pays reinsurance premiums generally based upon percentages of the company s premiums on the business reinsured 
these agreements expire at various intervals as to new risks  and replacement agreements are negotiated on terms believed appropriate in light of current market conditions 
during  the company replaced certain of its existing reinsurance arrangements for its excess workers compensation and long term disability products 
under the replacement arrangements for excess workers compensation products  the company reinsures excess workers compensation risks between million compared to million previously and million  and a substantial majority in proportionate amount of the risks between million and million  per policy per occurrence 
in addition  during  the company entered into a reinsurance arrangement under which the company cedes of its excess workers compensation risks between million and million  per policy per occurrence 
for long term disability products effective october  for new policies and  for existing policies  the earlier of the next policy anniversary date or october  the company reinsures risks in excess of  compared to  previously in benefits per individual per month 
these changes have reduced the reinsurance premiums paid by the company for these products 
rslic performance contingent options 
in december  the stock option and compensation committee the committee of the board of directors of the company granted additional performance contingent incentive options to purchase  shares of the company s class a common stock to each of lawrence e 
daurelle  president and chief executive officer of rslic  and the other six members of executive management of rslic 
such options have a ten year term and an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of the stock at the date of grant 
the options have the same five year financial performance target and performance period as the performance contingent incentive options that were granted in april the options will become exercisable if the specified target is met  otherwise a reduced number of such options will become exercisable according to where the performance target falls within a specified range  as defined and computed under the related option agreements for the five year performance period consisting of fiscal years through see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
sncc performance contingent options 
also  in december  the committee approved the amendment of the respective performance contingent incentive options to purchase  shares of the company s class a common stock previously granted to each of harold f 
ilg  chairman of the company s subsidiary  sncc  and the other four members of executive management of sncc 
pursuant to such amendment  such options will become exercisable if the aggregate consolidated pre tax operating income of sig holdings  inc  sncc s intermediate parent company  as defined and computed under the related option agreements sig ptoi  for the five year performance period consisting of fiscal years through is at least million  otherwise  a reduced number of such options will become exercisable to the extent that the aggregate sig ptoi for such period exceeds million  determined by interpolating between zero and  according to where the sig ptoi amount falls in the range between million and million 
none of such options became exercisable for the three year performance period consisting of fiscal years through see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
management s judgment is most critical in the estimation of its liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses and its assets for cost of business acquired and in the valuation of its investments 
a discussion of how management applies these critical accounting policies follows 
future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the company establishes reserves that are intended to be sufficient to fund the future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to its insurance products 
these reserves  which totaled  million at december   represent management s best estimate of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the reserves are calculated using various generally recognized actuarial methodologies and are based upon assumptions and estimates that management believes are appropriate and which vary by type of product 
annually  external actuarial experts also review the company s methodologies  assumptions and the resulting reserves 
the company s projected ultimate insurance liabilities and associated reserves are estimates  which are subject to variability 
this variability arises because the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
as a result  actual future ultimate losses will not develop exactly as projected and may vary significantly from the projections 
the estimation process is complex and involves information obtained from company specific and industry wide data  as well as general economic information 
the company s insurance reserves are based upon management s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data 
as additional experience emerges and other data become available  these estimates and judgments are reviewed and may be revised 
the methods and assumptions used to establish the company s insurance reserves are continually reviewed and updated based on current circumstances  and any resulting adjustments may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in the company s results of operations for the periods in which such revisions are made 
there were no material changes in the current year in the actuarial methods and or assumptions from those used in the previous periods  however  in and  the company experienced a degree of adverse variance in loss experience from its past projections 
see item  business property and casualty insurance reserves 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses for the company s disability and accident products relate to mortality  morbidity  claim termination and discount rates 
mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on various actuarial tables that are generally utilized in the industry  modified as believed to be necessary for possible variations 
the claim termination rate represents the probability that a disability claim will close or change due to maximum benefits being paid under the policy  the recovery or death of the claimant  or a change in status in any given period 
establishing claim termination rates is complex and involves many factors  including the cause of disability  the claimant s age and the type of contractual benefits provided 
the company uses its extensive claim experience database to develop its claim termination rate assumptions  which are applied as an average to its large population of active claims 
a one percent increase or decrease in the group long term disability claim termination rate established by the company  which the company believes is a reasonable range of variance in this regard  would have decreased or increased  respectively  the reserves established for claims incurred in by approximately million  which would have increased or decreased  respectively  its net income by million 
disability reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the company s discount rate assumptions are discussed in further detail below 
the company s reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are determined on an individual basis for reported claims  for which case reserves are established  and estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr losses are developed on the basis of past experience 
the unpaid claims and claim expense reserves carried for the company s property and casualty insurance products represent the difference between the selected ultimate loss amount and the loss amount paid to date 
the unpaid claims and claim expense reserves carried for the company s disability and accident insurance products are established by the incurred loss development method utilizing various mathematic tools in order to project future loss experience based on the company s historical loss experience 
the difference between total unpaid claims and claim expense reserves and case unpaid claims and claim expense reserves represent the ibnr reserve 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company s total reserves for disability  accident and casualty claims and claim expenses  as between case and ibnr reserves  as of december  dollars in millions balance  net of reinsurance case reserves disability and accident property and casualty ibnr reserves disability and accident property and casualty total reserves  reinsurance receivables balance  gross of reinsurance  balance sheets future policy benefits disability and accident unpaid claims and claim expenses disability and accident property and casualty the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for unpaid claims and claim expenses for the company s property and casualty insurance products are the trend in loss costs  the expected frequency and severity of claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
other assumptions include that the coverages under these insurance products will not be expanded by future legislative action or judicial interpretation and that extraordinary classes of losses not previously in existence will not arise in the future 
the assumptions vary based on the year the claim is incurred 
at december   disability and primary and excess workers compensation reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses with a carrying value of million have been discounted at a weighted average rate of  with the rates ranging from to 
disability reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the assets selected to support these liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments 
primary and excess workers compensation claim reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based on the risk free rate of return for us government securities with a duration comparable to the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled 
the rates used to discount reserves are determined annually 
the level of the rate utilized to discount reserves in a particular period directly impacts the level of the reserves established for such period 
for example  a basis point increase in the discount rates the company applied to disability and primary and excess workers compensation claims incurred in would have decreased the amount of the reserves it established with respect to such claims by approximately million  and a basis point decrease in such rates would have increased the amount of the reserves so established by the same amount 
in both cases  discount rate changes of this type and magnitude would reasonably reflect corresponding changes in market interest rates 
these levels of change to the company s discount rate would have increased  in the first case or decreased  in the second  its net income by million 
the primary actuarial methods used to establish the company s reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses for its property and casualty insurance products are the incurred loss development method and the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss method 
under the incurred loss development method  various mathematic tools are utilized in order to project future loss experience based on the company s historical loss experience 
this method is utilized for accident years as to which management believes a sufficient level of historical loss experience exists 
for more recent years for which this level of experience does not exist  management utilizes the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss method to establish loss reserves 
under this method  in addition to historical loss experience  the company also takes into account an expected loss ratio based on information determined during the initial pricing of the business  including  among other factors  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions 
the company s actuaries select an ultimate loss reserve amount for its property and casualty insurance products by reviewing the results of the actuarial methods described above  as well as other tertiary methods which serve to provide supplemental data points  and applying judgments to achieve a point estimate for the ultimate loss amount  rather than calculating ranges around the reserves 
reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses for such products represent management s best estimate and are based upon this actuarially derived point estimate 
in reviewing and determining the adequacy of this estimate  management considers several factors such as historical results  changes to policy pricing  terms and conditions  deductibles and attachment points  claims handling staffing  practices and procedures  effects of claim inflation  industry loss trends  reinsurance coverages  underwriting initiatives  and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments 
for the company s property and casualty insurance products  a review of the seven most recent years historical loss development variation reflects an annual range of to 
the average annual increase reflected in such review was and the average decrease was 
if the company were to assume subsequent loss development of or  each of which are within historical variation  the estimated unpaid claims and claims expense reserves  net of reinsurance  established for such products as of december  would be increased by million in the first case  which would have decreased its net income by million  or decreased by million in the second  which would have increased its net income by million 
management believes that while fluctuations of this magnitude could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  they would not be likely to materially affect its financial condition or liquidity 
however  it is possible that  using other assumptions or variables that are outside of the range of historical variation  the level of the company s unpaid claims and claim expenses could be changed by an amount that could be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
for the reasons described above  if the company s actual loss experience from its current or discontinued products is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
deferred acquisition costs 
costs related to the acquisition of new insurance business  such as commissions  certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and certain sales office expenses  are deferred when incurred 
the unamortized balance of these deferred acquisition costs is included in cost of business acquired on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs related to group life  disability and accident products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of the total expected premium income 
deferred acquisition costs related to casualty insurance products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the period in which the related premium is earned 
deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from such policies anticipated surrender charges and mortality  investment and expense margins 
the amortization is a constant percentage of estimated gross profits based on the ratio of the present value of amounts deferred as compared to the present value of estimated gross profits 
adjustments are made each year to reflect the actual gross profits to date as compared to assumed experience and any changes in the remaining expected future gross profits 
the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs related to certain asset accumulation products is adjusted for the impact on estimated future gross profits as if net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities had been realized at the balance sheet date 
the impact of this adjustment  net of the related income tax expense or benefit  is included in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
deferred acquisition costs are charged to current earnings to the extent that it is determined that future premiums or estimated gross profits will not be adequate to cover the amounts deferred 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts represented of the total amounts of the deferred acquisition cost balances outstanding at the beginning of the respective periods 
investments 
investments are primarily carried at fair value with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of the related income tax benefit or expense and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired 
ninety seven percent of the company s fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio are actively traded in a liquid market or have other liquidity mechanisms 
securities acquired through private placements  which are not actively traded in a liquid market and do not have other mechanisms for their liquidation  totaled million at december  the company estimates the fair value for these securities primarily by comparison to similar securities with quoted market prices 
if quotes are not available on similar securities  the company estimates fair value based on recent purchases or sales of similar securities or other internally prepared valuations 
key assumptions used in this process include the level of risk free interest rates  risk premiums  and performance of underlying collateral  if applicable 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate these investments in a timely manner  if necessary  may be adversely impacted by the lack of an actively traded market 
historically  the company has not realized amounts on dispositions of non marketable investments that varied materially from the amounts estimated by the company under this valuation methodology 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of these securities  however  had there been an active market for these securities during the applicable reporting period  the market prices may have been materially different than the amounts reported 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
the company evaluates  among other things  the financial position and prospects of the issuer  conditions in the issuer s industry and geographic area  liquidity of the investment  changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment  and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is other than temporary 
the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is lower than its amortized cost and the company s ability and intent to retain the investment to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s fair value are also considered 
in  and  the company recognized losses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for the other than temporary decline in the value of certain fixed maturity securities 
these losses were recognized as a result of events that occurred in the respective periods  such as downgrades in an issuer s credit ratings  deteriorating financial results of issuers  adverse changes in the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows from securities and the impact of adverse economic conditions on issuers financial positions 
investment grade and non investment grade fixed maturity securities comprised and  respectively  of the company s total investment portfolio at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to non investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized appreciation and depreciation  net of the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  has been reflected on the company s balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company anticipates that if certain existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million pre tax million to million on an after tax basis with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may exceed or be lower than such range 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of the company s procedures for the evaluation of other than temporary impairment in valuation 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
the company also invests in certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies which invest in various financial instruments 
these investments are reflected in the company s financial statements under the equity method  accordingly  positive or negative changes in the value of the investees underlying investments are included in net investment income 
for this purpose  the company estimates the values of its investments in these entities based on values provided by their managers  as adjusted based on available information concerning the underlying investment portfolios 
as of december  and  there were no adjustments in such values  as compared with a reduction in value of million as of december  the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the values of its investments in these entities  however  there can be no assurance that such values will ultimately be realized upon liquidation of such investments
