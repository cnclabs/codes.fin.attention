item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations general our results of operations reflect the level of offshore construction activity in the us gulf of mexico and in the international locations in which we operate 
the results also reflect our ability to win jobs through competitive bidding and manage awarded jobs to successful completion 
the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes 
the level of offshore construction activity is one of the three primary drivers of our business results in terms of revenues  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues margins 
the other two are pricing which is effected by contract mix and operating efficiency or productivity on a particular construction project 
activity levels have a significant impact on our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues because our business is very capital and personnel intensive 
our vessels  operations personnel  and marine facilities used to perform our construction work sit idle when not working  however  in most cases much of their costs  including depreciation  remain and are essentially fixed 
in general  as activity increases  a greater percentage of these fixed costs are recovered  therefore  more gross profit is recognized 
this increase in activity has the effect of improving gross margins 
as activity levels decrease  revenues decline but our costs do not decline proportionately thereby constricting our gross profit and margins 
activity levels can be affected by changes in demand due to economic or other conditions in the oil and gas exploration business  seasonal conditions in certain geographic areas and or our ability to win the bidding for available jobs 
our results of operations depend heavily on obtaining a sufficient quantity of offshore construction contracts with sufficient gross profit margins 
contract bidding is very competitive and  in the recent past  has resulted in contractors increasing their willingness to assume greater amounts of risk  for no additional or reduced pricing  in order to be awarded the contract 
as a result  contract margins have eroded throughout the industry 
however  recent trends indicate a decreased contractor tolerance for uncompensated risk and some recovery of contract margins 
most of our ocd revenue is obtained through larger  more complex contracts that are longer in duration and require significant amounts of working capital 
most of our international contracts are bid on a lump sum basis and are secured by a letter of credit or performance bond 
these contracts are inherently risky and are subject to many unforeseen circumstances and events that may affect productivity 
as productivity decreases  with no offsetting decrease in costs or increases in revenue  contract margins erode as compared to our bid margins 
as a result  our ocd revenues and margins are subject to a high degree of variability 
due to the nature of ocd contracts and adding to the degree of project execution difficulty  changes in the scope of the base contract sometimes occur as contract work progresses 
a change order usually increases the scope of work  but may also decrease the scope and  consequently  our revenue and costs 
either the customer or we may initiate change orders 
at the time of initiation  change orders may be approved or unapproved by either party  priced or unpriced  and or defined or undefined regarding detailed scope 
even where the scope of work is defined  the associated increase or decrease in contract revenue may be governed by contract terms or negotiated later  sometimes after the work is performed 
we recognize these change orders as revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
please read critical accounting policies and estimates 
most gdmc revenues are short term in nature  involve numerous smaller contracts  and are usually based on a day rate charge 
financial risks associated with these types of contracts are normally limited due to their short term and non lump sum nature 
revenues and margins in our gdmc division tend to be more consistent than in our ocd division 
overview as a result of persistently high energy prices and the effects of three major hurricanes in the us gulf of mexico  demand for the services performed by both of our divisions increased between the comparable years of and this increased level of demand  which began during the third quarter of  continued throughout the year of income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million in  primarily due to a million increase in gross profit which was partially offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in gross profit was driven by an increase in the overall level of activity in ocd and increased activity and improved pricing in gdmc partially offset by productivity issues and uncompensated weather related downtime in our ocd latin america and ocd asia pacific segments

consolidated revenues increased by to million in primarily due to an increase in worldwide activity in both of the company s divisions 
improved pricing for certain segments within these divisions also contributed to this increase in revenues 
additionally  million of this favorable variance is related to the existence of an adverse arbitration ruling that occurred in our ocd west africa segment during the third quarter of for a detailed discussion of revenues in each division and geographic area  please read segment information overview 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million to million in primarily due to the increase in revenues described above 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in from in the beneficial effects of increased activity and pricing on our gross profit percentage were partially offset by a deterioration of the profit margins earned in our ocd latin america and ocd asia pacific segments 
gross profit in our ocd latin america segment  as a percentage of revenues  declined to in from in due to low productivity and uncompensated weather related downtime on certain contracts 
gross profit in our ocd asia pacific segment declined to in from in primarily due to increased costs associated with the transfer of the hercules to the segment in and productivity issues and uncompensated weather related downtime in one large project 
net gains on asset disposal 
net gains on asset disposal decreased to million in in  we sold the derrick barge arapaho and an office facility in lafayette  louisiana for gains of million and million  respectively 
in  our net gains on asset disposal resulted primarily from the disposition of two dive support vessels and a cargo barge 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in this increase was primarily due to increased administrative labor costs in all of our segments  a million accrual for a tax penalty in our ocd latin america segment  increased management incentive plan accruals  and the allocation of a portion of corporate expenses to discontinued operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization from continuing operations  including amortization of dry docking costs  was million in compared to million in this increase was due primarily to higher utilization of our major construction vessels  which are depreciated on a units of production basis 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in primarily due to lower average debt outstanding 
other expense income 
other expense income was million income in and million expense in this change was primarily due to increased interest income and foreign exchange losses in compared to foreign exchange gains in net income from continuing operations net of taxes 
our net income from continuing operations increased by million to million in principally due to an increase in gross profit and the non recurrence of impairment losses recorded in partially offset by reduced gains on asset sales and increased selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed above 
our effective income tax rate was for and for our effective income tax rate exceeded in both periods primarily due to low earnings and or losses in certain foreign jurisdictions that are taxed on a deemed profits ie  percentage of revenue basis and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we did not record a tax benefit 
additionally  the tax rate in was adversely affected by non deductible losses in foreign jurisdictions related to asset impairments and an adverse arbitration ruling 
segment information overview 
our reportable segments include two divisions  ocd and gdmc  with five and four reportable segments  respectively 
ocd includes all pipelay and derrick lifts worldwide as well as diving and marine services in our asia pacific region 
we have identified nine reportable segments as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during and for additional information concerning the financial results of each segment  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
offshore construction division total revenues in ocd increased by million or between comparable years to million including million of intersegment revenues in from million including million intersegment revenues in this increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in activity levels between comparable periods in all of our ocd segments 
worldwide utilization of our major construction vessels increased to in from in additionally  an adverse arbitration outcome in our ocd west africa segment in and improved pricing in our ocd gulf of mexico segment in  as a result of hurricanes ivan  katrina  and rita  also contributed to this increase in revenues 
income from continuing operations before income taxes improved by million or to income of million in this improvement was primarily caused by the beneficial effects on profit margins of increases in activity and pricing discussed above and was partially offset by a deterioration of profit margins in our ocd latin america segment and ocd asia pacific segment 
gulf of mexico revenues increased to million in from million including million of intersegment revenues in due primarily to increased activity and improved pricing in the region 
activity and pricing in this segment began to improve in the fourth quarter of primarily due to increased demand caused by hurricane ivan 
this increased level of demand continued during the first two quarters of as the segment performed work on several projects related to hurricane ivan and one large pipeline construction project in trinidad 
demand for the services of our ocd gulf of mexico segment further intensified during the third and fourth quarters of due to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita  and the company initiated numerous projects for hurricane repairs on a day rate basis during these quarters 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million in primarily due to increased activity  improved pricing  and lower allocated costs due to vessels being transferred to other segments 
the hercules was transferred to our ocd asia pacific segment at the beginning of  and several vessels were temporarily assigned to our ocd latin america segment during the year 
utilization of our six major construction vessels in the gulf of mexico during was compared to seven vessels achieving in a comparison of bidding activity between comparable years was not meaningful for this segment due to increasing levels of hurricane repair work and day rate contracts being negotiated and performed in west africa revenues were million for compared to million in revenues for and included reductions in revenue related to adverse arbitration rulings and settlements of million and million  respectively 
activity in our ocd west africa segment increased slightly between comparable years  but bid margins declined 
utilization of our three barges in this segment was during as compared to in during the fourth quarter of  the construction barge  navajo  was transferred out of this segment into our gdmc middle east segment 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes decreased to million in compared to a loss of million in bidding activity and the dollar volume of bidding activity were up between the comparable periods 
latin america revenues increased to million in primarily due to an increase in activity within the segment 
six large projects were in progress during compared to five large projects in progress during income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased million to a loss before income taxes of million in due to low productivity on four projects  uncompensated weather related downtime  a million tax penalty reserve  and costs associated with the transfer of one barge to the region from the middle east 
seven barges achieved utilization in compared to four barges achieving utilization in bidding activity was down slightly but the dollar value of bidding activity was up significantly between comparable periods 
asia pacific revenues increased to million including million of intersegment revenues in due to increased activity which was associated with the transfer of the hercules to the segment 
however  loss from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in compared to a loss of million in the favorable effects of the increase in activity and an increase in net gains on asset disposals were completely offset by increased costs associated with the transfer of the hercules to the segment and by productivity issues and uncompensated weather related downtime in one large project 
the hercules achieved only utilization during the fourth quarter of due to the end of the working season in china and is scheduled to be out of service undergoing upgrades and repairs for most of the first quarter of utilization in for our four major construction vessels in this segment was compared to three barges achieving utilization in both bidding activity and the dollar value of bidding activity were up in compared to middle east revenues increased to million in one significant project which began in carried over to the current year  and a large multi year project was begun in the fourth quarter of utilization in of one major construction barge was compared to two barges achieving in the same period last year 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased million to income of million in compared to a loss of million in primarily due to increased activity  improved efficiencies and profit margins  and a gain of million on the disposition of a cargo barge 
additionally  results for included asset impairment losses of million 
bidding activity and the dollar value of bidding activity were relatively constant between the comparable years of and global divers and marine contractors division total revenues for gdmc increased by to million including million of intersegment revenues in income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million in the increases in revenues and income were due to increased activity in all of our gdmc segments and improved pricing in our gdmc gulf of mexico segment 
gulf of mexico revenues increased to million including million of intersegment revenues in from million including million of intersegment revenues in income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million for the increase in revenues and income were primarily due to increased activity and improved pricing as a result of hurricanes ivan  katrina  and rita 
the number of diver days increased in compared to the beneficial effects of increased activity and improved pricing were partially offset by increased labor  equipment rental  and fuel costs 
west africa revenues  all of which were intersegment revenues  increased by million to million in primarily due to the increase in activity in our ocd west africa segment 
income from continuing operations before income taxes for our gdmc west africa segment increased by million to million income in compared to a loss of million in primarily due to the beneficial effects of the increase in activity 
latin america revenues  all of which were intersegment revenues  increased by to million in primarily due to increased activity and an increase in the amount of saturation diving work 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million in primarily due to the factors which affected revenues 
profit margin as a percent of revenues declined between comparable periods primarily due to uncompensated rework costs on certain projects and higher repairs and maintenance costs 
middle east revenues increased to million including million of intersegment revenues due to increased activity from several large projects in india 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million in due to the increase in activity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  percentage change in millions unfavorable revenues cost of operations gross profit losses on asset impairment provision for vinci groupe gtm litigation net gains on asset disposal selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss other expense income interest expense other income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes benefit income loss from continuing operations net of taxes income loss from discontinued operations net of taxes operations gain on sale net income loss not meaningful revenues 
the decrease in revenues from to was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in activity in our ocd latin america segment  which was largely offset by reduced activity in our west africa segment and our ocd gulf of mexico segment 
revenues from our ocd latin america segment increased million due to five large contracts in process in compared with two contracts in revenues declined in our other ocd segments due to fewer large contracts in process and a million adverse legal judgment in our west africa segment relating to work performed in major construction barge utilization in our ocd was in compared with utilization in activity in our gdmc segments increased due to increased activity in our latin america segment and hurricane ivan damage repair work in our gulf of mexico segment 
total diving utilization was down  saturation diving utilization was up  and pricing was up compared to for a detailed discussion of revenues in each division and geographic area  see segment information overview 
gross profit 
the million increase in gross profit was due primarily to increased activity in our latin america segment and improved pricing in our gulf of mexico segments partially offset by a million adverse legal judgment in our west africa segment to work performed in in addition  in  our ocd west africa segment and our ocd gulf of mexico segment experienced productivity and efficiency decreases  with no offsetting decrease in costs or increase in revenues  which resulted in reduced contract margins 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in compared to for losses on asset impairments 
in the fourth quarter of  due to future trend information that became available and recent events regarding some of our geographic locations and assets  we examined each asset extensively to determine expected profitability and utilization 
each asset was analyzed and valued using either third party appraisals  comparable vessel sales  or probability weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis 
in conjunction with the analysis  we recorded a pretax non cash impairment charge of million relating to certain of our marine assets  which included the navajo in our ocd west africa segment  one cargo barge in our ocd middle east segment  and a support facility in our ocd gulf of mexico segment 
these assets were valued at their respective fair market values 
net gains on asset disposal 
net gains on asset disposal for include gains on the sale of the arapaho of million in our ocd gulf of mexico segment and lafayette office facility of million in our other segment 
net gains on asset disposal in include million from the sale of the derrick barges mohawk and sara maria in our ocd latin america segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses were million as compared to million reported during this increase was due primarily to increases in costs related to consulting  external accounting and legal fees partially offset by reduced bad debt expense and decreased labor costs 
operating income 
the increase in our operating income from to was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit described above and the gain from asset sales partially offset by impairment changes 
in addition  our operating loss included a provision of million pre tax related to the adverse ruling in the long standing litigation with groupe gtm now vinci partially offset by gains on asset sales 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization from continuing operations  including amortization of dry docking costs  was million in as compared to million in a decrease in overall utilization was substantially offset by a different mix of barge utilization of our major construction barges  which are depreciated on a units of production basis 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for primarily due to increased average interest rates  a million write off of the unamortized credit facility fees in due to the termination of our previous credit facility  increased bank loan origination fee expense  and a million redemption premium related to the early redemption of million principal amount of united states government guaranteed ship financing bonds title xi bonds 
these increases were partially offset by decreased average debt outstanding 
other expense income 
other expenses increased million to million for  from other income of million for  due primarily to increased exchange rate losses 
net loss from continuing operations net of taxes 
the increase in our net loss was the result of the factors described above that reduced our gross profit and operating income 
our effective tax rate is in compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the following losses in certain foreign jurisdictions primarily west africa that are taxed on a deemed profits  percentage of revenue  basis  losses in certain foreign asset impairments that are not tax effected  and losses related to the adverse judgment in our west africa segment related to offshore pipeline work performed in that are not tax effected 
the increase was partially offset by the reversal of a million valuation allowance  due to a capital gain on the sale of the arapaho which allowed the utilization of the loss carryforward 
our effective tax rate for includes a million tax expense attributable to the establishment of a valuation allowance for a capital loss carryforward and losses in other jurisdictions that were not tax benefited 
income from discontinued operations net of taxes 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes of  for was million including the gain on the sale of the liftboats of million after tax  compared to income  net of taxes of  of million for the same period last year 
segment information overview 
our reportable segments include two divisions  the ocd and the gdmc  with five and four reportable segments  respectively 
the ocd includes all pipelay and derrick lifts worldwide as well as diving and marine services in our asia pacific region 
our gdmc includes all remaining diving and marine support services worldwide 
our gdmc gulf of mexico segment prior periods results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of the liftboat division as discontinued operations 
we have identified nine reportable segments as required by sfas although total revenues in our ocd decreased slightly to million including intersegment revenues of million in from million including intersegment revenues of million in  results improved dramatically as this division s income before taxes increased to million in from a loss before taxes of million in this increase was primarily due to the following increased activity in the latin america segment  gains of million on asset sales on vessels in the ocd gulf of mexico segment  and increased margin in the ocd gulf of mexico segment due to hurricane ivan damage repair work 
the increase was partially offset in by an impairment of million on three vessels and one facility  an adverse legal judgment of million in the ocd west africa segment  and a custom duty reserve of million in our latin america division 
contributing to the positive comparative change between and  are the following negative events that did not recur in productivity losses on several significant projects in our west africa segment resulting in significant project losses  misappropriation of our funds by an indigenous import export agent on a project in west africa  productivity losses on two significant projects due to inclement weather and subcontractor work stoppages in the gulf of mexico resulting in significant project margin deterioration  and reduced activity in the latin america segment  which historically maintains favorable contract margins 
total revenues from our gdmc division increased million  or  to million including million intersegment revenues in from million including million intersegment revenues 
in this division s results increased substantially from income before taxes of million in to income before taxes of million in revenues and earnings increased due to increased saturation diving activity and improved pricing in the gulf of mexico segment due primarily to hurricane ivan damage repair work and increased activity in our latin america segment increased activity in our latin america segment 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during and for additional information concerning the financial results of each segment  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
offshore construction division gulf of mexico revenues decreased to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due primarily to reduced activity in the region 
in  several small contracts were completed as compared to one large contract that was in progress in the as a result  income before income taxes increased to million for  including a million gain on the sale of the derrick barge arapaho and the effect of million of impairment costs  from a loss before income taxes of million for earnings increased due to improved margins on hurricane repair work and the shifting of costs related to certain gulf of mexico construction vessels as a result of their working in our latin america segment 
in addition  in we experienced productivity losses on two significant projects due to inclement weather and subcontractor work stoppages 
utilization of our major construction barges in the us gulf of mexico during decreased to from in the same period last year 
bidding activity was up compared to the same period last year due primarily to hurricane ivan damage repair work 
west africa revenues decreased to million for compared to million for the decrease in revenues was due to the existence of several large projects in as compared to only two small day rate contracts in the period and the impact of an million adverse ruling in loss before income taxes decreased to million for  including the effect of million of impairment costs  compared to a loss before income taxes of million for this was primarily a result of margins being favorable on the day rate contracts in as compared to the lump sum contracts in in the period  we experienced approximately a million deterioration on a pipeline contract in west africa due to a welding problem 
utilization of our major construction barges in this segment during decreased to from over the same period last year 
bidding activity was also down compared to last year 
latin america revenues increased significantly to million for from million for due primarily to work performed on five large contracts in the as a result  income before income taxes increased million to million for compared to a loss before income taxes of million for  which included a million gain on the sale of two construction vessels 
partially offsetting these gains in were losses on two contracts of million and a customs duty reserve of million 
the barges in this segment achieved utilization in compared to in the same period last year 
bidding activity was up over last year 
asia pacific revenues decreased million to million for compared to million for loss before income taxes increased million to million in compared to a loss before income taxes of million for the decrease in revenues and increase in loss before income taxes was due primarily to decreased activity in the region 
utilization for our three major construction vessels was compared to last year 
bidding activity was up compared to last year 
middle east for  revenues decreased significantly to million compared to million for due primarily to the existence of one large contract  with a large amount of procurement content  in progress in the period 
as a result  including the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs in  income before income taxes decreased million to a loss before income taxes of million for compared to income before income taxes of million for utilization for our two major construction barges was in compared to in the same period last year 
bidding activity was down compared to the same period last year 
global divers and marine contractors division gulf of mexico revenues increased to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million to million for compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of million for the increase in revenues and income from continuing operations before income taxes was due primarily to increased activity from hurricane ivan damage repair work and improved pricing for our services 
west africa revenues  all of which were intersegment revenues  decreased to million for from million for income from continuing operations before income taxes declined million to a loss before tax of million for compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of million for the decrease in revenue and income before tax was due primarily to decreased activity 
latin america revenues increased to million all of which were intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for  due primarily to work performed on five large contracts in the period 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased for to million compared to a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million for  as a result of the contracts performed in the period 
middle east for  revenues increased to million including million of intersegment revenues compared to million including million of intersegment revenues for due to increased activity in the region 
as a result  income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million for compared to million for liquidity and capital resources overview the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets particularly for the enhancement and acquisition of vessels and funding working capital  losses from operations and repayment of debt 
cash to fund the needs of our business has been provided primarily by operations  debt financing  asset sales and equity issuances 
we expect activity levels to increase over the next twelve months 
our backlog increased to million at the end of from million at the end of in february  we were awarded a major project in mexico which has an estimated value of million 
this increase in activity will require increases in working capital 
we expect that our cash balances and credit facility will provide adequate funding for this anticipated increase in working capital to the extent it occurs in advance of increases in our cash flows from operations 
in addition  the judgment against us in the groupe gtm now vinci litigation may require a substantial cash payment pending our appeal of the judgment 
capital expenditures for are currently expected to be between million and million 
cash flow our cash balance decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  during  our continuing operations generated cash flow of million compared to million generated in due to higher levels of activity  the amount of cash paid to suppliers for materials and services related to projects increased between comparable years 
as of december   a substantial portion of these expenditures were not yet recovered in cash by the company and were reflected in the carrying amounts of accounts receivable  unbilled work on uncompleted contracts  and contract costs incurred not yet recognized 
working capital increased by million during to million at december  we expect that working capital will continue to increase as activity increases 
approximately of our million backlog at december  is expected to be performed during investing activities resulted in a million net use of cash 
proceeds from the sale of assets supplemented by cash on hand  funded capital expenditures of million and dry docking costs of million 
we estimate that the cost to complete capital expenditure projects in progress at december  will be approximately million 
these capital expenditures are primarily related to vessel and equipment upgrades 
as of december   we had purchased million shares of our common stock since the inception of our million stock repurchase program at a total cost of million 
during   and  we did not repurchase any shares 
our credit facility described below limits stock repurchases 
long term debt long term debt outstanding at december  including current maturities includes million of title xi bonds and no amounts drawn against our bank credit facility 
on march   we amended and restated our credit facility 
this amendment was added to improve operating flexibility and to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
the amendment i decreased the credit facility to million from million  ii provided for an additional million credit capacity option  if needed  upon receipt of additional loan commitments by our existing and or additional lenders  iii reduced the requirements of the minimum net worth covenant for all future periods  iv changed the maximum leverage ratio to include title xi bonds  v added a minimum fixed charge coverable ratio  vi eliminated all the remaining financial covenants  vii reduced the interest rate spread applicable to the company s borrowings under the credit facility 
the spreads can range from to and to for prime rate and libor based on borrowings  respectively  based upon certain of our financial ratios  vii reduced the number of participants in the syndication from seven to three  and viii extended the maturity of the credit facility to march from march a fee of million was paid for this amendment 
on june   the credit facility was increased to million to provide additional credit capacity due to increased bonding requirements and increased the number of participants in the syndication from three to four 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants associated with our credit facility 
as of february   we had no borrowings  million of letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit availability under our revolving credit facility 
our outstanding title xi bonds mature in the bonds carry an interest rate of per annum and require aggregate semi annual payments of million  plus interest 
the agreement pursuant to which the title xi bonds were issued contains certain covenants  including the maintenance of minimum working capital and net worth requirements 
if not met  additional covenants result that restrict our operations and our ability to pay cash dividends 
at december  we were in compliance with these covenants 
other indebtedness and obligations we also have a million short term credit facility at one of our foreign locations which is secured by a letter of credit 
additionally  in the normal course of business  we provide guarantees and performance  bid  and payment bonds pursuant to agreements or in connection with bidding to obtain such agreements to perform construction services 
all of these guarantees are secured by parent company guarantees 
the aggregate of these guarantees and bonds at december  was million in surety bonds and million in bank guarantees letters of credit 
the surety bonds and bank guarantees letters of credit expire between january and december and between january and december  respectively 
we have a long term charter of the titan  a foot self propelled twin hulled derrick ship 
the vessel charter payments are approximately million annually 
the charter term is months expiring august this charter can be canceled by us at anytime  subject to a termination penalty of the transfer to the vessel owner of title to our dynamic positioning dp system used on the vessel 
the dp system was purchased and installed on the titan at our cost in the first quarter of for a total cost of million 
in december of  we entered into a long term charter for a newly built dive support vessel to be delivered in june this charter  which includes a five year fixed term and a one year option  requires monthly payments denominated in norwegian kroners at an annual rate of approximately million kroners or million as of february  
during the first quarter of  we entered into a forward currency agreement which will allow the company to fulfill its norwegian kroner obligations under the charter at predetermined exchange rates 
under the terms of the forward currency agreement  the company s required us dollar payments will gradually increase from approximately million during the first year of the charter to million during the last year of the fixed term of the charter 
minimum rental commitments under leases having an initial or remaining non cancelable term in excess of one year for each of the five years following december  and in total thereafter follow in thousands thereafter total off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements  including bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds  which totaled approximately million at december  summary of contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt principal only long term debt interest only operating lease obligations cancelable operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total 
for more information regarding our long term debt obligations  including interest payments  please read note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
represents the titan lease 
includes the five year term charter of a newly built dsv to be delivered in june liquidity outlook we expect funds available under our credit facility  available cash  and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to fund our operations including the anticipated increase in working capital required to fund increasing activity  scheduled debt retirement  planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months  as well as any required payments related to the vinci groupe gtm judgment 
in addition  as we have in the recent past  we will also continue to evaluate the divesture of assets which are no longer critical to our operations in order to reduce our operating costs and debt levels 
over the longer term  we expect cash from operations  supplemented by equity financings and proceeds from long term debt  to provide sufficient funds to operate and expand our business and maintain our fleet 
for flexibility  we maintain a shelf registration statement that as of march  permits the issuance of up to million of debt and equity securities 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of equipment or businesses  which may require additional liquidity 
industry and business outlook we expect worldwide activity to continue to increase during the next twelve months 
persistently high oil prices and the effects of three major hurricanes in the us gulf of mexico have increased demand for the services provided by both of our divisions 
at the present time  it appears that our assets in the us gulf of mexico will be highly utilized during as massive hurricane damage and historically high energy prices drive demand for our services in this region 
due to an increasing proportion of hurricane repair work contracted on a day rate basis  our domestic backlog and bidding activity levels are not indicative of the level of demand for our services in the us gulf of mexico 
due to persistently high energy prices  demand for our services in international regions has increased as well 
as of december   our backlog in international regions was million 
coupled with this worldwide demand for services  however  is a corresponding demand for experienced personnel in our industry 
this high level of demand for personnel has fully utilized the currently available pool of experienced personnel  especially in the us gulf of mexico 
given this situation  we must make every effort to retain our experienced personnel and continuously seek  find  and train new personnel 
if we are unable to retain and hire a sufficient number of qualified personnel  our operations may suffer due to an inability to accept additional work or due to performance or safety issues 
additionally  other activities which are associated with periods of high demand  such as relocating vessels  recommissioning vessels  and coordinating an increasing number of projects  also increase the level of risk in our operations 
we are experiencing an increase in bidding activity and in the dollar volume of bidding activity in many of the regions where we do business 
as of february   we have bids outstanding and in house totaling approximately billion 
in addition  both contract terms and pricing in our domestic and international locations have become more favorable than were experienced in and the first half of new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that these items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have adopted sfas no 
as of january  and do not expect that adoption of the standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r also requires a public entity to initially measure the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for an award of liability instruments at its current fair value 
the fair value of that award is to be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the required service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
we have adopted sfas no 
r as of january  and anticipate that the annual impact on our diluted earnings per share will be between and per share 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle or the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted sfas as of january  and do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from construction contracts  are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost the cost to cost method of the respective contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect vessel costs including depreciation and amortization  labor  supplies  and repairs 
during the early stages of a contract  certain costs may be excluded from the cost to cost method of measuring progress  such as significant costs for materials and major third party subcontractors  if it appears that such an exclusion would result in a more meaningful measurement of actual contract progress and resulting periodic allocation of income 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
we also provide services on a day rate basis to many of our customers in both our offshore construction division and our global divers and marine contractors division 
revenue for these services is recognized as the services are rendered and when collectability is reasonably assured 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
moreover  adjustments  if any  are reflected in income in the period when any adjustment is determined 
to the extent that an adjustment results in a reduction of previously reported profits  we could recognize a significant charge against current earnings to reflect the adjustment 
in addition  we include claims and unapproved change orders to the extent of costs incurred in contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs are identifiable  and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable include both billed and unbilled receivables 
these receivables often include claims and unapproved change orders 
the claims and unapproved change orders included in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables  amounted to million at december  and million at december  unbilled retainage at december  was million and is expected to be billed in unbilled retainage at december  was million 
we continually monitor our receivables for collectability and make the appropriate allowances when deemed necessary 
property and equipment long lived assets held and used by us primarily marine barges  vessels and related equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of an asset group can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the cash flow estimates are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry wide trends  and expected vessel day rates  utilization and margins 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
historically  changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
at december   we had available net operating loss nol carryforwards for foreign jurisdiction purposes of approximately million  which  if not used  will expire between and one foreign jurisdiction has an indefinite nol carryforward period 
we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the million mexico nol carryforwards and million of the nol carryforwards in our asia pacific segment will be utilized prior to their expiration 
a valuation allowance has been set up for the remaining foreign nol carryforwards as we do not believe that they will be utilized prior to their expiration 
in certain situations  we provide for taxes where assessments have not been received 
in those situations  we consider it probable that the taxes ultimately payable will exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns  accordingly  taxes are provided in those situations under the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
future events such as changes in the facts or tax law  judicial decisions regarding existing law or a favorable audit outcome may later indicate the assertion of additional taxes is no longer probable 
in such circumstances  it is possible that taxes previously provided would be released 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge rising interest rates and forward currency contracts to hedge exchange rate risk 
we have approximately million of fixed interest rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a market value of approximately million on december  a general decrease of in overall market interest rates would increase the market value of the debt by approximately million 
we use natural hedging techniques to hedge against foreign currency exchange losses by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
we also  to the extent possible  maintain cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
we do not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions in which we operate would have a significant effect on our results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a five year term charter for a newly built dive support vessel to be delivered for service in june under the terms of the charter  we will be required to make monthly payments denominated in norwegian kroners at an annual rate of approximately million kroners or million as of february  
during the first quarter of  we entered into a forward exchange contract which effectively fixes the exchange rate for our commitments under this long term charter
