item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have developed a broad line of pre programmed universal wireless control products and audio video accessories that are marketed to enhance home entertainment systems 
our channels of distribution include international retail  us retail  private label  oems  cable and satellite service providers  cedia  and companies in the computing industry 
we believe that our universal remote control database contains device codes that are capable of controlling virtually all infrared remote ir controlled tvs  vcrs  dvd players  cable converters  cd players  audio components and satellite receivers  as well as most other infrared remote controlled devices worldwide 
beginning in and continuing today  we have compiled an extensive library that cover nearly  individual device functions and over  individual consumer electronic equipment brand names 
our library is regularly updated with new ir codes used in newly introduced video and audio devices 
all such ir codes are captured from the original manufacturer s remote control devices or manufacturer s specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database 
we have also developed patented technologies that provide the capability to easily upgrade the memory of the wireless control device by adding ir codes from the library that were not originally included 
beginning in  we began selling our nevo software embedded on our chip 
nevo was launched in july of both these products were featured on a series of hewlett packard personal digital assistants pda  which reached their end of life during the third quarter of building on this platform  we used some components of the nevo technology in a new product named nevosl which we began to ship in the second quarter of the nevosl is a universal controller that delivers complete audio  visual and wi fi digital media control for the networked home 
from october  through december   we acquired over of the outstanding shares of simpledevices  inc simpledevices for approximately million in cash  including direct acquisition costs  plus a performance based payment of our unregistered common stock to be paid in the first quarter of if certain financial objectives are achieved 
the performance based payment has not been reflected as part of the purchase price as of december   since we believe that it is not probable that the performance metrics will be met 
the value we received from this acquisition relates primarily to simpledevices unique capabilities  as well as its complete and in process technology 
simpledevices has developed connected device technology solutions that link the home computer and the internet to existing consumer electronic devices in the home and car 
the company provides upnp compatible software to transform common home devices into connected devices that is  devices that can find  control and share entertainment media across a home network 
upnp is an architecture for pervasive peer to peer network connectivity of intelligent appliances  wireless devices  and pcs of all form factors 
it is designed to bring standards based connectivity to ad hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home  in a small business  public spaces  or attached to the internet 
upnp is a distributed  open networking architecture that leverages tcp ip and the web technologies to enable seamless proximity networking in addition to control and data transfer among networked devices in the home  office  and public spaces 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  warranties  inventory valuation  business combination purchase price allocations  our review for impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
actual results may differ from the estimates  and these estimates may be adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustment could be significant 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on the sale of products when delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
the provision recorded for estimated sales returns and allowances is deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the period the related revenue is recorded 
sales allowances reduce gross accounts receivable to arrive at accounts receivable  net in the same period the related receivable is recorded 
we have no obligations after delivery of our products other than the associated warranties 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value 
the fair values for the multiple elements are determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  or the price charged when the element is sold separately 
the residual method is utilized when vsoe exists for all the undelivered elements  but not for the delivered element 
this is performed by allocating revenue to the undelivered elements that have vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
when the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we account for revenue under software licensing arrangements involving significant production  modification or customization of software in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
when applying the percentage of completion method  we rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue and labor hours 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and labor applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known  and losses are accrued when identified 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
specifically  we analyze historical bad debts  customer credit profiles  current economic trends and changes in customer payment behavior when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories 
our inventories consist of wireless control devices  including universal remote controls  wireless keyboards  antennas  and related component parts including integrated circuits and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we carry inventory in amounts necessary to satisfy our customers inventory requirements on a timely basis 
new product innovations and technological advances may shorten a given product s life cycle 
we continually monitor our inventory status to control inventory levels and dispose of any excess or obsolete inventories on hand 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory s cost and its estimated market value based upon our best estimates about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and 
table of contents development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the total purchase price of simpledevices  which was approximately million  including direct acquisition costs  has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer contracts  developed and core technology and trade names 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future free cash flow from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and cash flows from the products once they are completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates utilized in discounted cash flow models 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets 
we assess long lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review if significant include the following underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  changes in the strategy of our overall business  negative industry or economic trends  a decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a variance between our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset or an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we perform an impairment review 
if the carrying value of the asset is larger than the undiscounted cash flows  the asset is impaired 
we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing the recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available  and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 

table of contents to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we must provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
in situations involving tax related uncertainties  we provide for deferred tax liabilities when we believe such liabilities are probable 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the same period last year 
net income for was million or per share 
table of contents basic and per share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for millions of total millions of total net sales business consumer total net sales net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were approximately of net sales for compared to for net sales in our business lines for increased by to million from million in this increase in sales resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of remote control sales  which was partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in remote control sales volume was attributable to the continued deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators and market share gains with a few key subscription broadcasting customers 
these advanced functions include digital video recording dvr  video on demand vod  and high definition television hdtv 
royalty revenue revenue earned through licensing of intellectual property recognized in attributable to agreements signed in the fourth quarter of of million and the acquisition of simpledevices also contributed to the increase in net sales 
the acquisition of simpledevices added net sales of million and to the business category net sales growth 
we expect that the deployment of the advanced function set top boxes by the service operators will continue into the foreseeable future as penetration for each of the functions cited continues to increase 
as a result  we expect business category revenue to range between million in net sales in our consumer lines one for all international retail  private label  custom installers  and direct import were approximately of net sales for compared to for net sales in our consumer lines for decreased by to million  from million in the decrease in sales resulted primarily from a decrease in european retail sales  which were down to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes in the uk market and the weakening of both the euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar 
the impact of the weakening currencies resulted in a decrease in net sales of approximately million 
excluding the negative foreign exchange impact  european retail sales decreased million compared to private label sales decreased by to million in from million in this was due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
kameleon sales declined during compared to as a result of fewer new product introductions 
united states direct import licensing and product revenues for decreased by to million from million in due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
partially offsetting these decreases was our entry into the cedia market  in the second quarter of this added net sales of million and to the consumer category net sales growth as compared to we expect consumer category revenue to range between million in gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was compared to for the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to subscription broadcast sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate as compared to our other sales  representing a larger percentage of our total business 
the impact of this change in mix was a reduction in the gross profit rate 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by an additional million of freight expense recorded in as compared to a portion of this increase in freight relates to sales volume  however  the majority of the increase is due to a change in rate 
in  there was an increase in the percentage of units that were shipped by air versus ocean as well as a mix shift towards subscription broadcast sales 
freight contributed to a reduction in the gross profit rate 
duties increased million  as a larger percentage of units were imported 
the increase in duty expense contributed to a reduction in the gross profit rate 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by the weakening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately million and a reduction of in the 
table of contents gross profit rate 
all other product costs  which include warranty expense  quality assurance expense  and component costs  increased million and reduced the gross profit rate by 
partially offsetting these decreases in the gross profit rate was a reduction in inventory scrap expense of million 
this reduction added to the gross profit rate 
in addition  royalty expense declined million due to the decline in the volume of kameleon sales  which added to the gross profit rate 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is related to our continued expansion of the nevo platform and development efforts taking place at simpledevices 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in the development of audio video accessories for sale in our retail channel 
we expect research and development expense to remain near current levels for the full year selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to the acquisition of simpledevices  million to payroll and benefits  million to bad debt expense  which included a million reserve for a receivable due from a former european distributor  million to delivery and freight costs caused by the increase in volume  million to increased tax and audit fees  million to sales commissions  million to travel  million to trade shows  million to temporary clerical and warehouse staff  and million to all other selling  general  and administrative costs 
these items were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense  which decreased by million  temporary professional staff  which decreased by million  outside legal fees  which decreased by million  and employment and recruiting costs  which decreased million 
we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will range from to million for the full year in  we recorded million of interest income compared to million for this increase is due to higher money market rates 
net interest income will be approximately million in in  other income  net was million as compared to million of other expense  net for approximately million of other income in resulted from foreign currency transaction gains reflecting the strengthening of the us dollar

we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate was in  and in we estimate that our effective tax rate will range between and for the full year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
simpledevices simpledevices recorded net sales of million and a pretax loss of million in sales consisted primarily of engineering services related to the development of hardware utilized by simpledevices customers to run the simpleplatforms software 
in addition  simpledevices also generated revenue by customizing its software products to customer s specific needs 
sales attributable to simpledevices are included in our business category when we discuss consolidated results 
the results of simpledevices have been included since the date of acquisition and are described below 
gross profit was million  or of sales 
research and development expenses were million  which consisted primarily of internal and external development efforts related to simpledevices core software product 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  which consisted primarily of engineering payroll and benefits costs as well as outside product development costs 
we anticipate that sales generated as a result of software customization and engineering services will begin to decline as a percent of total sales as software licensing fees and the associated maintenance 
table of contents fees begin to increase 
we also anticipate that gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales will increase as this shift occurs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the year ended december  net income for was million or per share basic and per share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for millions of total millions of total net sales business consumer total net sales net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were approximately of net sales for compared to for net sales in our business lines for increased by to million from million in net sales to subscription broadcasting service providers and oems for increased by to million from million in the increase in sales resulted from an increase in the volume of remote control sales  which was partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in volume was attributable to the continued deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators 
these advanced functions include personal video recording pvr  video on demand vod  and high definition hd television

the remaining improvement in international retail sales was due to an increase in sales of our sky branded digital accessories  one for all remote controls  and audio video accessories 
private label sales for decreased by to million from million in due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
united states direct import licensing and product revenues for decreased by to million from million in due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was compared to for the increase was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase of approximately million profit and added to the gross profit rate 
this increase was partially offset by increased inventory write downs of million which contributed to a reduction in the gross profit rate 
in addition  the increase in gross profit rate was partially offset by oem sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate  being a larger percentage of our total business 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was related to our continued expansion of the nevo platform  and the development of audio video accessories for sale in our retail channel 
in addition  ipr d of million related to the simpledevices acquisition was expensed in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  million to appreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar  million to increased performance 
table of contents based employee bonuses  million to the acquisition of simpledevices  million to freight costs  and million to non sarbanes oxley related professional services costs 
in  we recorded million of interest income compared to million for this increase was due to higher money market rates in europe  an investment in a certificate of deposit  and a higher average cash balance 
in  other expense  net was million as compared to million of other income  net for approximately million of expense was the result of our write down of an investment in a private company  and million of expense resulted from foreign currency exchange losses 
the results for included a foreign currency exchange gain of million 
we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to million in our estimated effective tax rate was in  and in simpledevices  inc transaction we accounted for the acquisition of simpledevices by the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we allocated the purchase price of the acquisition based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
significant portions of the simpledevices purchase price were identified as intangible assets 
we employed valuation techniques which reflected guidance from the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid series entitled assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices  and pharmaceutical industries on approaches and procedures to be followed in developing allocations to acquired ipr d 
the final purchase price allocation included our identification of thousand of ipr d 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value  based upon risk adjusted cash flows  of simpledevices ipr d projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the ipr d had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as research and development in the quarter ended december  the remaining simpledevices purchase premium was allocated to identifiable intangibles  which are being amortized over various periods ranging from to years  as well as goodwill 
simpledevices recorded net sales of million and a pretax loss of million during the period between october  acquisition date and december  sales consisted primarily of engineering services related to the development of hardware utilized by simpledevices customers to run the simpleplatforms software

cash provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from operations in compared to is primarily due to lower income tax payments in  increased cash collections resulting from higher net sales offset partially by an increase in our days sales outstanding dso and accounts payable accrued expenses increasing by a greater amount in versus there were certain operating factors that affected our liquidity during  which we expect will continue to affect our liquidity in the future 
one factor was the extension of payment terms with two of our major customers from to days and to days  respectively 
these payment term extensions resulted in an increase in our dso from days at december  to days at december  in addition  our liquidity was also affected by a planned increase in our inventory balance 
we increased our inventory balances as a result of our strategy to lower the amount of products that are air shipped 
during  there was increased demand for advanced function set top boxes that include features such as dvrs  pvrs and hdtv 
this shift drove a corresponding increase in demand from our subscription broadcast customers for our remote controls that interact with these advanced set top boxes 
through the first two quarters of  we did not have enough inventory on hand to meet this demand 
as a result  we were forced to air ship a significant amount of orders to maintain our customer service level 
in order to alleviate the higher costs related to air shipments  we increased our inventory levels 
we believe that the cost savings from shipping via ocean freight versus air will be greater than the additional carrying cost of the increase in inventory 
our net inventory turns were turns at december   down from turns at december  cash used provided by investing and financing activities cash used for investing activities during was million as compared to million and cash provided of million during and  respectively

historically  our working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
at december   we had million of working capital as compared to at december  the increase in working capital during these periods is principally due to higher accounts receivable and inventory balances at december  compared to december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods

in june  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations fsp  which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the directive  which was adopted by the european union eu 
under the directive  the financing of historical waste held by private households is to be borne collectively by producers that are selling in the market during each measurement period to be defined by each eu member country 
the volume of equipment that qualifies as historical waste that those producers have sold in the market prior to the measurement period is not considered 
producers will be required to contribute proportionately based on their participation in the market for example  in proportion to their respective shares of the market by type of equipment 
however  the exact method to be used to compute the respective proportions to be contributed by producers will be determined by each eu member country 
for commercial users  the waste management obligation for historical equipment products put on the market on or prior to august  remains with these entities until the equipment is replaced 
fsp is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member countries in which we have significant operations 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated results of operations

such effects will depend on the respective laws adopted by the eu member countries 
outlook our focus is to build technology and products that make the consumers interaction with devices and content within the home easier and more enjoyable 
the pace of change in the home is increasing 
the growth of new devices  such as dvd players  pvr dvr technologies and home theater solutions  to name only a few  has transformed control of the home entertainment center into a complex challenge for the consumer 
the more recent introduction and projected growth of digital media technologies in consumers lives will further increase this complexity 
we have set out to create the interface for the connected home  building a bridge between the home devices of today and the networked home of the future 
we intend to invest in new products and technology  particularly in the connected home space  which will expand our business beyond the control of devices to the control of and access to content  such as digital media  to enrich the entertainment experience 
we will continue enhancing our leadership position in our core business by developing custom products for our subscription broadcasting  oem  retail  and computing customers  growing our capture expertise in infrared technology and radio frequency standards  adding to our portfolio of patented or patent pending technologies and developing new platform products 
we are also developing new ways to enhance remote controls and other accessory products 
during  we will continue to develop new products featuring our kameleon interface technology  a display technology that provides ease of use by illuminating only the keys needed to control each entertainment device 
we are continuing development of our nevo technology  an embedded solution that transforms an electronic display into a sophisticated and easy to use wireless home control and automation device 
we are continuing to seek ways to integrate these platform technologies into other forms and devices 
nevo was launched in july of as a feature on a series of hp s handheld devices  which reached its end of life during the third quarter of building on this platform  we used some components of the nevo technology in a new product named nevosl which we began to ship in the second quarter of this product is designed for use in the home 
in addition  we are working on product line extensions to our one for all audio video accessories which include digital antennas  signal boosters  television brackets and a v cleaning products 
we are also seeking ways to increase our customer base worldwide  particularly in the areas of subscription broadcasting  oem  and one for all international retail 
we will continue to work on strengthening existing relationships by working with customers to understand how to make the consumer interaction with products and services within the home easier and more enjoyable 
we intend to invest in new products and technology to meet our customer needs now and into the future 
through simpledevices  we continued developing software and firmware solutions that can enable devices such as tvs  set top boxes  stereos  automotive audio systems and other consumer electronic products to wirelessly connect and interact with home networks and interactive services to deliver digital entertainment and information 
this smart device category is emerging and in we look to build relationships with our customers in this category 
in  we will continue to evaluate acceptable acquisition targets and strategic partnership opportunities in our core business lines as well as in the networked home marketplace 
we caution  however  that no assurance can be made that any suitable acquisition target or partnership opportunity will be identified and  if identified  that a transaction can be consummated 
moreover  if consummated  no assurance can be made that any such acquisition or partnership will profitably add to our operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of these risks and the use of financial instruments to mitigate our risk exposure 
the interest payable under our revolving credit facility with our bank is variable and based on either i the bank s cost of funds or ii the libor rate plus a fixed margin of  the rate is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   we had no borrowings on our credit facility 
the interest rate in effect on the credit facility as of december  using the libor rate option plus a fixed margin of was 
this credit facility will expire in september and we are currently negotiating to extend this credit facility 
at december  we had wholly owned subsidiaries in the netherlands  united kingdom  germany  france  argentina and spain 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in local currencies including euros  british pounds and argentine pesos  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  and in some cases  to each other  may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and net income 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates that affect cash flows and our reported income 
contract terms for the foreign currency exchange agreements normally last less than nine months 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the value of our net balance sheet positions held in foreign currency can also be impacted by fluctuating exchange rates  as can the value of the income generated by our european subsidiaries 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of fluctuations on reported income  as it depends on the opening and closing rates  the average net balance sheet positions held in a foreign currency and the amount of income generated in local currency 
we routinely forecast what these balance sheet positions and income generated in local currency may be  and we take steps to minimize exposure as we deem appropriate 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to the variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currency 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we believe that movements in foreign currency rates could have a material affect on our financial position 
we estimate that if the exchange rates for the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar fluctuate from december   first quarter net income and cash flows would fluctuate by approximately million and million  respectively
