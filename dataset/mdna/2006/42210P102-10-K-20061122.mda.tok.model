item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  future references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
introduction during the past several years  we have executed on our two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from our existing operating business units and diversifying from over reliance on the legacy alternative energy segment section k 
formerly section business 
with the addition and expansion of the ccp management and marketing business through acquisitions in and in  and the growth of the construction materials business  culminating in several large and small acquisitions in  and  we have achieved revenue growth and diversification into three business segments 
because we also incurred increased indebtedness to make strategic acquisitions  one of our ongoing financial objectives is to continue to focus on increased cash flows for purposes of reducing indebtedness 
a material amount of our consolidated revenue and net income is derived from license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which depend on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generates tax credits under section k 
formerly section of the internal revenue code 
we also claim section k tax credits based upon synthetic fuel sales from facilities in which we own an interest 
from time to time  issues arise as to the availability of tax credits and  with the rising price of oil  the phase out of credits  including the following items 
by law  section k tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expire on december  in addition  section k tax credits are subject to phase out after the average annual us wellhead oil price reference price reaches a beginning phase out threshold price  and are eliminated entirely if the reference price reaches the full phase out price 
there was no phase out of section k tax credits for calendar  however  we believe that due to higher oil prices in  partial phase out of tax credits will occur for calendar as of the date hereof  substantially all of our licensees are producing synthetic fuel  but most licensees stopped production for a period of time earlier in the year 
these events have materially adversely affected both the amount and timing of recognition of our revenue  net income and cash flow  and will have a material adverse effect in future periods as well 
reference is made to notes and to the consolidated financial statements where there is more information on phase out and other uncertainties related to section k tax credits that have affected our business in and that are likely to continue to affect our business 
our acquisition strategy targets businesses that are leading players in their respective industries  that enjoy healthy operating margins and that are not overly capital intensive  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of our existing businesses 
in addition  in  we have begun to acquire small companies with innovative products that can be marketed using our existing distribution channels 
we are also committed to continuing to invest in research and development activities that are focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology 
we have agreed to a joint venture project to construct  own and operate an ethanol plant located in north dakota which is currently expected to begin operating in early calendar  and are also beginning to invest in other alternative energy projects such as coal cleaning and the use of nanocatalysts to engineer coal for emissions reduction 
as a result of our ccps and construction materials businesses  we are also affected by seasonality  with the highest revenues and profitability produced in the june and september quarters 
with ccps  our strategy is to continue to negotiate long term contracts so that we can invest in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
we also intend to continue our efforts to expand usage of high value ccps and develop uses for lower value ccps  including the expanded use of ccps in our construction materials businesses and the industry in general 
in and continuing into  we have focused on the integration of our acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse construction materials products through our national distribution network 
we became highly leveraged as a result of those acquisitions  but have reduced our outstanding debt since that time through cash generated from operations  from an underwritten public offering of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
we intend to continue to focus on repaying long term debt while continuing to look for diversification opportunities within prescribed parameters 
consolidation and segments consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
we are also required to consolidate any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  however  as of september   there are none 
for investments in entities in which we have a significant influence over operating and financial decisions generally defined as owning a voting or economic interest of to  we apply the equity method of accounting 
in instances where our investment is less than and significant influence does not exist  investments are carried at cost 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we made several significant acquisitions in and several insignificant acquisitions in these entities results of operations for the periods from the acquisition dates through september  have been consolidated with our results  their operations up to the dates of acquisition have not been included in our consolidated results for any period 
segments 
we currently operate three business segments within two industries  the construction materials and ccps segments in the building materials industry  and the alternative energy segment in the energy industry 
these segments are managed and evaluated separately by management due to differences in their operations  products and services 
prior to  the businesses in the construction materials segment manufactured and distributed bagged concrete  stucco  mortar and block products 
the acquisitions expanded our concrete block business  and added manufactured architectural stone and resin based siding accessories and related products used in exterior residential home improvement and construction to the product line 
revenues for the construction materials segment consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
the ccp segment manages and markets coal combustion products such as fly ash and bottom ash  known as ccps  to building products and ready mix concrete companies 
we purchase ccps from coal fired electric power generation plants under long term contracts and supply them to our customers as a replacement for manufactured or mined materials  primarily portland cement 
ccp revenues consist primarily of product sales with a small amount of service revenue 
the alternative energy segment includes our legacy coal based solid alternative fuels business and several newer initiatives  including coal cleaning  coal drying  ethanol and the commercialization of catalyst technologies  primarily catalysts that help improve the yield and quality of petroleum based fuels 
revenues for this segment consist primarily of sales of chemical reagents and license fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
we currently license our technologies to the owners of coal based solid alternative fuel facilities in the us license agreements contain a quarterly earned royalty fee generally set at a prescribed dollar amount per ton or a percentage of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
recurring license fees or royalty payments are recognized in the period when earned  which coincides with the sale of alternative fuel by our licensees  provided standard revenue recognition criteria such as amounts being fixed or determinable are met 
in most instances  we receive timely reports from licensees notifying us of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due us under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  we have experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  can be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees with whom an established pattern exists 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee is beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility is sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there is no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may be more limited information available to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  we use such information as is available and where possible  substantiate the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  we are unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and revenue recognition is delayed until a future date when sufficient information is known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
pursuant to the contractual terms of an agreement with one licensee  the license fees owed to us  which accumulated during a period of approximately two and a half years ending in  were placed in escrow for our benefit pending resolution of an audit of the licensee by the irs 
certain accounting rules governing revenue recognition  requiring that the seller s price to the buyer be fixed or determinable as well as reasonably certain of collection  appeared to preclude revenue recognition for the amounts placed in escrow because they were potentially subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the irs audit 
accordingly  none of the escrowed amounts were recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of income through december  during the march quarter  the fieldwork for the tax audit of the licensee was completed and there were no proposed adjustments to the tax credits claimed by the licensee 
as a result  in march we recognized revenue  net of the amount we were required to pay to a third party  relating to the funds deposited in the escrow account totaling approximately million 
approximately million of this amount related to revenue recorded in the march quarter and approximately million was recorded as revenue related to prior periods 
during the june quarter  the irs completed its administrative review of the licensee s tax audit and the escrowed amounts were disbursed from the escrow account and paid to us 
in addition to the escrowed amounts  this same licensee has also set aside substantial amounts for working capital and other operational contingencies as provided for in the agreement 
these amounts may eventually be paid out to various parties having an interest in the cash flows from the licensee s operations  including us  if they are not used for working capital and other operational contingencies 
as a result  we currently expect to receive at some future date a portion of those reserves  the amount of which is not currently determinable and which constitutes a gain contingency not recognizable as revenue 
in  we entered into an agreement with ajg financial services  inc the agreement provided for ajg to pay royalties and allowed ajg to purchase proprietary chemical reagent material from us 
in october  we filed a complaint in the fourth district court for the state of utah against ajg alleging that it had failed to make payments and to perform other obligations under the agreement 
we asserted claims including breach of contract and sought money damages as well as other relief 
ajg s answer to the complaint denied our claims and asserted counter claims based upon allegations of misrepresentation and breach of contract 
this litigation came to the trial phase in january the jury reached a verdict substantially in our favor and the court entered a judgment for us against ajg in the amount of approximately million which included approximately million in prejudgment interest 
in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with ajg which provided for payments to us in the amount of million at the time of settlement which payment was received in may  million related to a contract modification for use of technology in january  and certain quarterly payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for calendar years through payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for the first three quarters of calendar year were received in january  with all other quarterly payments for through payable days after the end of each quarter 
payments based upon tax credits for through are subject to downward adjustment or elimination if a phase out of section tax credits occurs due to high oil prices 
we recognized the million contract litigation settlement gain  net of payments due to a third party  as a reduction in operating costs and expenses in the million  net of payments due to a third party  is being recognized as revenue over calendar years through the ongoing quarterly payments based upon tax credits are being recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
in connection with the settlement of the ajg litigation  we also recognized approximately million of revenue from a licensee with an indirect interest in that litigation  all of which related to periods prior to january  ongoing revenue from this licensee is also being recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
certain accounting rules limit revenue recognition to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the amount of license fee revenue we recognized for was materially negatively affected by significantly reduced revenues being recognized for several licensees whose license agreements call for us to be paid a portion of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
because the calendar phase out percentage for section k tax credits can not be finalized at the current time  only approximately million of revenues for these licensees was recognized for the nine months ended september  the amount recognized met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it is remote that any negative adjustment will be required in the future 
additional revenues for these licensees  which could total more than million calculated based on licensee reported data  which amount ultimately depends on the calendar phase out percentage of section k  will not be recognized until such time as these amounts become fixed or determinable 
income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments were required in the calculation of our income tax provisions for the years presented  most particularly for one of the key estimates affecting our tax provision relates to the amount of section k 
formerly section tax credits that will ultimately be available related to our interest in an entity that owns and operates a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility see note to the consolidated financial statements  plus two other smaller alternative fuel facilities that we own and operate 
while the calendar section k tax credit phase out percentage can not be finalized at the current time  as of september   an estimated phase out percentage of is our best estimate of what the phase out percentage for calendar would be  using available information as of that date 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer probable or necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
these intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill  all of which relates to acquisitions that occurred from through sfas no 
requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment at least annually  or sooner if evidence of possible impairment arises 
we perform our annual impairment testing as of june  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair values of the reporting units that have goodwill 
currently  five reporting units have goodwill  three of which are in the construction materials segment 
there is one reporting unit with goodwill in each of the ccps and alternative energy segments 
step of impairment testing consists of determining and comparing the fair values of the reporting units to the carrying values of those reporting units 
if step is failed for a reporting unit  indicating a potential impairment  we would be required to complete step  which is a more detailed test to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill  and compare that value to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is required to be recorded 
we have performed step impairment tests of recorded goodwill as of june   and  all of which indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
accordingly  step of the impairment tests was not required to be performed  and no impairment charges were necessary 
in addition to the annual review  we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we would amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a decline in operating performance indicators  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
in  the construction materials segment revised downward the estimated useful lives of certain assets resulting in accelerated depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over shorter periods 
it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that resulting write downs could be material 
stock based compensation 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we early adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation required by sfas no 
r  effective as of october   the beginning of our fiscal year 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb and requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other equity based awards 
stock based compensation expense is reported within the same operating expense line items as used for cash compensation expense 
a significant amount of the stock based compensation resulted from the expense associated with the grants of immediate vested sars and from the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options 
due to immateriality  we have not capitalized any compensation cost as part of the cost of any asset 
tax benefits resulting from exercise of stock options and sars are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity and cash flows 
we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of stock based awards for all awards expected to vest  over the period during which the related service is rendered by grantees 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined primarily using the black scholes merton b s m model  which is the same valuation model used previously in valuing stock options for the pro forma footnote disclosures under the requirements of sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we use the graded vesting or accelerated method to value awards and to allocate those values over the requisite service periods  again the same method as used previously in determining pro forma expense under sfas no 
our estimated forfeiture rates are based largely on historical data and ranged from to during and  depending on the type of award and the award recipients 
as of september   the estimated forfeiture rate for most unvested awards is per year 
the fair values of stock options and sars granted in and were estimated using the b s m model  adjusted where necessary to account for specific terms of awards that the b s m model does not have the capability to consider 
we use the services of an independent valuation firm to validate our fair value estimates and assumptions and also to determine certain necessary adjustments to the b s m model output 
one such adjustment was used in determining the fair value of sars which have a cap on allowed appreciation 
for these sars  the output determined by the b s m model was reduced by an amount determined by a quasi monte carlo simulation to reflect the reduction in fair value associated with the appreciation cap 
expected stock price volatility was estimated using historical volatilities of our stock  implied volatilities of traded options on our stock  volatility predicted by a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model  and an analysis of volatilities used by other public companies in comparable lines of business 
risk free interest rates used were the us treasury bond yields with terms corresponding to the expected terms of the awards being valued 
in estimating expected lives  we considered the contractual and vesting terms of awards  along with historical experience  however  due to insufficient historical data from which to reliably estimate expected lives  we used estimates based on the simplified method set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 where expected life is estimated by summing the award s vesting term and the contractual term and dividing that result by two 
the reduction in value related to grantee payment for certain immediate vested sars was estimated by management based on the terms of the payment requirements and other factors 
a significant amount of our outstanding sars vest over five years and most of these sars are exercisable based on the achievement of performance criteria related to our economic growth during the five year period 
we currently expect the performance criteria to be achieved and therefore are recording compensation expense over the five year period  which also represents the requisite service period 
if this expectation changes in the future  some or all of the compensation expense recognized up to that time would be reversed 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we will recognize additional non cash compensation expense in future periods 
as of september   there was approximately million of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  combined with the settlement of the ajg litigation described above  was a contributing factor in our decision to grant employee incentive awards in  in particular to grant fewer options and more sars  including many that vested immediately  the granting of performance based awards  and the acceleration of vesting of stock options 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to billion as compared to billion for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
construction materials segment 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to increases in volume  which occurred across all major product lines  with a lesser impact from price increases related to passing on to customers a portion of raw material cost increases 
the primary reasons for the decline in gross margin percentage from to were acceleration of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate certain assets over shorter estimated useful lives  additional operating costs as production levels were managed downward to account for the downturn in the residential housing market and higher raw material costs  only a portion of which were passed on to customers 
because a substantial amount of our revenues in this segment are dependent on the housing market  we anticipate some impact in from the current slowdown in the housing industry 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in ccp revenues and in the gross margin percentage during were due primarily to a combination of continued strong demand for ccps  upward pricing trends in most concrete markets  and increased project revenues 
in addition  weather conditions in the south central region of the united states have generally been favorable in the growth in demand for ccps is due in part to certain regional shortages of portland cement for which ccps are a substitute  which can result in an increased percentage of ccps being used in concrete 
the cement shortages also resulted in increased prices for ccps in several markets 
alternative energy segment 
our alternative energy segment revenue consists primarily of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to our solid alternative fuel technologies  and to a lesser extent  sales of synthetic fuel from two solid alternative fuel production facilities that we own that began operating in the major components of revenue for the alternative energy segment are discussed in the sections below 
a material amount of our consolidated revenue and net income is derived from our license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which depend on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generates tax credits under section k 
formerly section of the internal revenue code 
from time to time  issues arise as to the availability of tax credits and  with the rising price of oil  the potential phase out of credits  as described previously and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the significance of these issues  it is not possible to predict the trend of alternative energy revenue in future periods 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the decrease in chemical reagent sales during was due to decreased synthetic fuel production by our licensees resulting in decreased sales of million  and by customers with whom we do not have a license agreement resulting in decreased sales of million 
the primary reason for decreased synthetic fuel production in was the potential for significant phase out of section k tax credits  resulting in licensees and other customers stopping or significantly curtailing production for a period of time during it is not possible to predict the trend for sales of chemical reagents in future periods 
the gross margin percentage for of was lower than s gross margin percentage of due primarily to increases in the cost of product  which in turn is related to increases in the costs of petroleum based materials 
we currently believe reagent margins will decrease further in future periods  depending upon crude oil prices and other factors 
license fees 
during  we recognized license fee revenue totaling million  a decrease of million or from million of license fee revenue recognized during the primary reason for the decrease in license fee revenue in compared to relates to significantly reduced revenues being recognized for several licensees whose license agreements call for us to be paid a portion of the value of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
certain accounting rules limit revenue recognition to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
because the calendar phase out percentage for section k tax credits can not be finalized at the current time  only approximately million of revenues for these licensees was recognized for the nine months ended september  the amount recognized met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it is remote that any negative adjustment will be required in the future 
additional revenues for these licensees  which could total more than million calculated based on licensee reported data  which amount ultimately depends on the calendar phase out percentage of section k  will not be recognized until such time as these amounts become fixed or determinable 
reference is made to our policy disclosures discussed previously 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement with a certain licensee  this licensee has set aside substantial amounts for working capital and other operational contingencies as provided for in the agreement 
these amounts may eventually be paid out to various parties having an interest in the cash flows from the licensee s operations  including us  if they are not used for working capital and other operational contingencies 
as a result  we currently expect to receive at some future date a portion of those reserves  the amount of which is not currently determinable and which constitutes a gain contingency not recognizable as revenue 
other alternative energy segment revenues 
sales of synthetic fuel during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of synthetic fuel during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of synthetic fuel from to was due to the synthetic fuel facilities starting operations in spring revenue from the sale of synthetic fuel has a negative gross margin  which is more than compensated for by the income tax credits expected to be earned from the sales of the synthetic fuel 
amortization and research and development expenses 
there were no material changes in either amortization or research and development expenses from to both expense categories are currently expected to remain near historical levels in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses decreased million  or to million for from million for the decrease in was due primarily to significant one time stock based compensation costs in related to the implementation in of sfas no 
r million 
offsetting this decrease was a million increase in marketing expense related to efforts in the construction materials segment to increase awareness and sales of new products 
contract litigation settlement 
in  we settled our litigation with ajg 
in connection with the litigation settlement  a payment of million was received in this amount  net of payments due to a third party and less the amount recognized as a reimbursement of legal fees approximately million  was reflected as a reduction in operating costs and expenses 
other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was attributable to a decrease in net interest expense of million and a decrease in other expenses of million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to significantly lower average levels of long term debt in compared to the decrease in other expenses of million consisted primarily of a decrease in costs of approximately million related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary reason for decreased costs for this facility is related to using an estimated phase out percentage for section k tax credits for calendar of approximately  all as explained in note the alternative fuel produced at the facility through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section k of the internal revenue code  and we are entitled to receive our pro rata share of such tax credits generated based upon our percentage of ownership of the facility 
partially offsetting the decrease in costs related to our investment in the alternative fuel facility was an increase of million in charges primarily related to a joint venture investment and the disposition of property  plant and equipment 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision for both and resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately 
the low effective tax rate for both years is primarily due to tax credits related to the two coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that we own and operate  plus our interest in an entity that owns and operates another alternative fuel facility where we are not the primary beneficiary 
the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section k 
formerly section of the internal revenue code  subject to the uncertainties of phase out  irs audit and other risks associated with the tax credits  all as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the tax credits  our estimated effective tax rate for and would be approximately and  respectively 
as a result of high oil prices in  it appears there will a partial phase out of section k tax credits for calendar therefore  in calculating an income tax provision for fiscal  we assumed a phase out percentage for section k tax credits for calendar of 
this estimated phase out percentage was derived by estimating the calendar reference price for oil using actual oil prices for the months january through july  and published nymex oil prices for the months august through december the monthly nymex oil prices were reduced by approximately  which reduction represents our estimate of the relationship between nymex prices and the average us wellhead oil prices actually used to calculate the annual reference price 
the estimated reference price for calendar was calculated by averaging the months actual or estimated oil prices  which average was compared to the estimated phase out range for calendar to to derive an estimated phase out percentage 
while the calendar phase out percentage can not be finalized at the current time  as of september   an estimated phase out percentage of is our best estimate of what the phase out percentage for calendar would be  using available information as of that date 
as of march   the estimated phase out percentage for calendar was and as of june   the estimated percentage was 
the effect on income taxes of the change in the phase out percentage from to the actual percentage for the year will be recorded to income tax expense in subsequent periods  when all of the calendar actual oil prices are known 
any such effect could be material to our income tax expense 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to billion as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
construction materials segment 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to the acquisitions 
the increase in gross margin percentage from to was due primarily to significantly higher margins from the operations of the acquired businesses 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in ccp revenues during was due primarily to an acquisition of a ccp company in and growth in demand for ccps  partially due to shortages in portland cement 
the cement shortages also resulted in increased prices for ccps in several markets 
the gross margin percentage decreased from to by approximately due primarily to the acquired company  which typically has lower gross margins than the legacy ccp business 
the acquired company s impact on gross margin in was more significant than in because there was only six months of activity for the acquired company in alternative energy segment 
our alternative energy segment revenue consists primarily of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to our solid alternative fuel technologies  and to a lesser extent  sales of synthetic fuel from two solid alternative fuel production facilities that we own that began operating in revenue from the sale of synthetic fuel has a negative gross margin  but is more than compensated for by the income tax credits earned from the sales of the synthetic fuel 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales during was due primarily to increased synthetic fuel production by our licensees resulting in increased sales of million and by customers with whom we do not have a license agreement resulting in increased sales of million 
of the increased sales to customers  million represents sales of chemical reagent related to the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility in which we are a minority owner see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the gross margin percentage for of was lower than for  due primarily to increases in the cost of product  which in turn is related to increases in the costs of petroleum based materials  and to a lesser extent  changes in customer mix 
license fees 
during  we recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or from million of license fee revenue recognized during the primary reasons for the increase in license fee revenue in compared to relate to the settlement of the ajg litigation described below million in total 
in addition  license fee revenue from licensees not associated with the litigation increased million from to as a result of increased production of alternative fuel by these licensees 
in  we entered into a settlement agreement with ajg which provided for payments to us in the amount of million at the time of settlement discussed below in the caption contract litigation settlement  million related to a contract modification for use of technology in january  and certain quarterly payments based upon tax credits associated with ajg s facilities for calendar years through the million  net of payments due to a third party  is being recognized as revenue over calendar years through  however  because the settlement agreement was not reached until may  six months of revenue covering the period january  through june  was recognized in the quarter ended june  the ongoing quarterly payments are being recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue 
in total  we recognized approximately million of license fees from ajg in million of which directly related to the settlement of litigation  compared to million of license fee revenue from ajg in in connection with the settlement of the ajg litigation  we also recognized approximately million of revenue from a licensee with an indirect interest in that litigation  all related to periods prior to january  ongoing revenue from this licensee is also being recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for license fee revenue and was approximately million in offsetting these increases  was a million decrease in revenue recognized from a licensee for which we recognized million of net revenue in  representing funds previously deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of certain contingencies  all relating to alternative fuel sold prior to december  we recognized a total of approximately million of revenue from this licensee in and million of revenue in for more information about the revenue related to this licensee  see license fee revenue recognition in the critical accounting policies and estimates section above 
amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the fiscal acquisitions and the resulting increases in amortizable intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development activities and the recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense in related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
no such expense was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately million and the acquisitions approximately million 
a substantial portion of the expense related to stock based compensation represent the expense associated with the grant of immediate vested sars and the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options million  as explained in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these two events are not likely to recur in the foreseeable future 
there was only million of stock based compensation included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in contract litigation settlement 
in  we settled our litigation with ajg 
in connection with the litigation settlement  a payment of million was received in this amount  net of payments due to a third party and less the amount recognized as a reimbursement of legal fees approximately million  was reflected as a reduction in operating costs and expenses because it represents a non recurring litigation settlement that is not reflective of our revenue components described above  but is directly related to our operating activities 
other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was attributable to an increase in net interest expense of million in and a net increase in other expenses of approximately million in net interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to significantly higher average levels of long term debt in compared to  as a result of the acquisitions 
we incurred approximately million of interest expense related to the early repayment of senior debt in  consisting of accelerated amortization of debt issue costs of million plus million of prepayment penalties 
in connection with the reduction of the amount of senior debt hedged from million to million  as allowed under terms of the amended credit facility  we recognized a gain of approximately million  which was recorded as a reduction in interest expense 
the net change in other expenses of million consisted primarily of a million increase in costs related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements  partially reduced by million of losses on notes receivable and other asset write offs in that did not recur in and an increase of million in gain on disposition of property  plant and equipment 
income tax provision 
our effective income tax rate for was approximately 
this compares to an effective tax rate of approximately for the primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate is the federal income tax credits available as a result of our investment in an entity that owns and operates a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility see note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as our ownership of two other alternative fuel production facilities that began operating in the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section k of the internal revenue code 
excluding the effect of the tax credits  our effective tax rate in would have been approximately 
impact of inflation and related matters our operations have been impacted in by i rising costs for chemical reagents in the alternative energy segment  ii increased cement  polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride costs in the construction materials segment  iii increased fuel costs that have affected transportation costs in most of our business units  and iv certain regional shortages of cement and aggregate materials 
the increased costs of chemical reagents  polypropylene  poly vinyl chloride and fuel are directly related to the increase in prices of natural gas  oil and other petroleum based materials 
the increased costs of cement are caused primarily by a lack of adequate supplies in some regions of the us we have been successful in passing on some  but not all  of the increased material and transportation costs to customers 
it is not possible to predict the future trend of material and transportation costs  nor our ability to pass on any future price increases to customers 
it is also not possible to predict the impact of potential future cement supply shortages on our ability to procure needed supplies in our construction materials business 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million compared to million during most of the million difference was due to significant changes in operating assets and liabilities between and  including in the receipt of the final million payment due from the litigation settlement reached with ajg in fiscal in both years  the primary investing activity consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
in  we also made investments in joint ventures and incurred payments for acquisitions 
the primary financing activity for both years consisted of repayments of long term debt 
in  proceeds from the issuance of common stock was also a significant financing activity 
more details about our investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were not materially different from the amount 
most of the capital expenditures in both periods were incurred by the construction materials segment  however in fiscal  a higher proportion of total capital expenditures were incurred by the ccp and alternative energy segments  as compared to a significant portion of our planned future capital expenditures represent expansion of operations  rather than maintenance of operating capacity 
capital expenditures for fiscal were limited to million by our senior debt covenants 
the covenants limit capital expenditures to million in and subsequent years  however  the cumulative unused amounts of annual capital expenditures limits can be carried forward and used in subsequent years 
as of september   we have approximately million of unused amounts of capital expenditures from prior years and we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations  commercialization of technologies currently being developed  and strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand our current operating platform 
acquisitions are an important part of our business strategy and to that end  we routinely review potential complementary acquisitions  including those in the areas of construction materials  ccp marketing  and coal and catalyst technologies 
it is possible that some portion of future cash and cash equivalents and or proceeds from the issuance of stock or debt will be used to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses in the chemical  energy  building products and related industries 
the senior secured credit agreement limits acquisitions in the aggregate to million of cash consideration and million of non cash consideration annually  with no more than million of cash consideration for any one acquisition  unless our total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  after giving effect to an acquisition  in which case the foregoing limitations do not apply 
the senior secured credit agreement also limits the amount we can invest in joint ventures and other less than owned entities 
we entered into an agreement with degussa ag  an international chemical company based in germany  to jointly develop and commercialize a process for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  we committed to fund of the joint venture s research and development expenditures through september  subject to a stipulated maximum 
the amount remaining to be paid under this commitment as of september  is not material 
in  we formed another joint venture with degussa ag  degussa headwaters korea co  ltd 
dhk  which purchased a hydrogen peroxide production business located in south korea 
we are a principal obligor with respect to all non financial obligations of dhk and  with respect to financial obligations of dhk  of future plant expansion cost overruns  if any 
our investments in joint ventures with degussa ag in which degussa and headwaters have equal ownership  voting rights and control are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and total approximately million at september  we also own a interest in a joint venture with great river energy  a minnesota based power generation and supply cooperative gre  which was formed to construct  own and operate an ethanol plant in north dakota blue flint 
the plant is currently expected to begin operating in early calendar with estimated ethanol production of million gallons annually 
estimated costs to construct the ethanol plant and fund start up costs and initial working capital approximate million  which is being funded primarily by debt secured by all the assets of blue flint  along with capital contributions from us and gre 
we have made our full capital contribution as of september  the blue flint joint venture  which is not a variable interest entity  is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting because both partners have equal voting rights and control over the joint venture 
our investment in the blue flint joint venture totals approximately million at september  we agreed to pay an earn out to the sellers of a subsidiary company acquired in if a specified earnings target was exceeded during the months ended december  the earn out period 
the earn out achieved totaled million and was recorded as additional goodwill when it was paid to the former owners of the subsidiary in during  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of several privately held companies in the construction materials industry 
total consideration paid or accrued for these acquisitions was less than million 
pursuant to contractual terms for some of the acquisitions  additional amounts may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of stipulated revenue or earnings targets for periods ending no later than march if future earn out consideration is paid  goodwill will be increased accordingly 
operating results since acquisition dates for all of the businesses combined were not material 
in november  we acquired of the ownership interests of a privately held company in the construction materials business 
total consideration paid was approximately million 
pursuant to contractual terms  an additional amount may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of a stipulated earnings target for the months ending september  financing activities 
due to the issuance of senior debt in september and the covenants associated with that debt  we currently have limitations on our ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
however  we have experienced strong positive cash flow from operations and in fiscal issued common stock which together has enabled us to repay a substantial amount of our long term debt prior to the scheduled maturities 
we expect our positive cash flow to continue in the future and also have the ability to access the equity markets if necessary 
we have an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec that can be used for the sale of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt and other securities 
approximately million remains available for future offerings of securities under this registration statement 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering would commence under the registration statement 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information about our outstanding long term debt including repayments and future maturities  interest rate hedges  and compliance with debt covenants 
we may  in the future  make optional prepayments of the senior debt depending on actual cash flows  our current and expected cash requirements and other applicable factors we deem to be significant 
as provided for in the senior debt agreements  we have available million under a revolving credit arrangement  along with the ability to increase this amount to million  subject to obtaining additional revolving loan commitments 
borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement are generally subject to the terms of the first lien loan agreement 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  when all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement as of september   or subsequent thereto 
the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   eight letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from october to december the credit agreements contain restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset sales and liens  annual capital expenditures in excess of million for and million thereafter  and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  we must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  in  cash proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchases totaled million  compared to million in option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  we receive an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts  reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows  were million in and million in the negative amount in was caused by a reversal of amounts pertaining to prior periods  stemming from adjustments related to an ongoing irs audit 
working capital 
during  our working capital increased by million  to million as of september  we expect operations to produce positive cash flow in future periods and believe working capital  along with available borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement  will be sufficient for operating needs for the next months 
income taxes 
our cash requirements for income taxes generally approximate the income tax provision  however  there is usually some lag in paying estimated taxes during a fiscal year due to the seasonality of operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing the fiscal year s income based on year to date results 
there is also some lag in realizing the cash benefits from the utilization of tax credits due to the interaction of our september fiscal year end and the different fiscal year ends of the entities through which we receive the tax credits 
in fiscal  there was more variability in the relationship between the income tax provision and income tax payments because the tax provision calculation is materially dependent upon the estimated phase out percentage of section k tax credits see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the phase out percentage is subject to material change at this date because it is dependent on oil prices for the remainder of calendar  which are not predictable 
therefore  the tax provision reflected in the consolidated financial statements is also subject to material change 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which amount was a negative million in option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
likewise  it is not possible to estimate what tax benefits may be realized from future option exercises 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant future cash uses  in addition to operational working capital requirements  including income tax payments  are currently expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures  investments in joint ventures  acquisitions and debt service payments on outstanding long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements although we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  and hedge agreements to limit our exposure to interest rate increases  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by fiscal year after in millions total senior secured debt

as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our senior debt credit facility provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit arrangement  along with the ability to increase this amount to million  subject to obtaining additional revolving loan commitments 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  when all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement as of september   or subsequent thereto 
the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   eight letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from october to december during  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of several privately held companies in the construction materials industry 
total consideration paid or accrued for these acquisitions was less than million 
pursuant to contractual terms for some of the acquisitions  additional amounts may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of stipulated revenue or earnings targets for periods ending no later than march during  the compensation committee of our board of directors the committee authorized the grant of long term incentive cash bonus awards to certain officers and employees  which awards were granted under our long term incentive compensation plan 
in accordance with terms of the awards  cash payments are based on several factors  including the achievement of stipulated financial goals as measured by economic value added eva over a three year period by our operating units 
payments for these awards may not exceed million in the aggregate 
no amounts have been expensed for these awards through september  because it is not yet probable that the financial goals will be met 
during  the committee also approved executive change in control agreements with officers 
upon a change in control  as defined  the agreements provide for immediate vesting and exercisability of all outstanding stock awards 
in addition  if termination of employment occurs within a specified period of a change in control  the agreements provide for i severance pay equal to two times the sum of an officer s current annual salary plus the highest cash bonus paid or payable for any single year in the three year period commencing two years prior to the year in which the change in control occurs  and ii continuance of health and other benefits and perquisites for a two year period following the change in control 
if terminations associated with a change in control would have occurred on september   the severance payments due to the officers would have aggregated approximately million 
during the committee authorized the grant of performance unit awards  to be settled in cash  based on performance criteria tied to the economic value created or preserved by one of our business units after december the grants of these performance units were made in and could result in the payment to employees of a maximum amount of approximately million if all performance criteria are met 
no amounts have been expensed for these awards through september  because it is not yet probable that the performance criteria will be met 
in addition to our standard sales commission arrangements  we have entered into a contingent commission agreement whereby we have agreed to pay an employee total sales commissions up to a maximum amount of million 
the agreement calls for payments to be made for customer purchase orders of a stipulated size and for a stipulated period of time to be executed prior to may no amounts have been expensed under this agreement through september  we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flows or financial position 
historically  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
during  we incurred approximately million of net expense for legal matters  including costs for outside legal counsel  compared to approximately million in and million in in  developments in certain legal matters we are defending resulted in reduced likelihood of ultimate legal liability and a reduction of expense 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and has recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or our liability 
it is not possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although we believe that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time  and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement standard  as well as clear criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring tax positions  for financial reporting purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosures with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning on october  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin the effect of adopting fin  if material  will be a transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
we must adopt sfas no 
no later than in our fiscal year ending september  we use fair value measurements to determine the reported amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements  in testing for potential goodwill impairment see note  for disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments see note  as well as in other instances 
it is therefore possible that the implementation of sfas no 
could have a material effect on the reported amounts or disclosures in our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
we have reviewed all other recently issued accounting standards which have not yet been adopted in order to determine their potential effect  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we do not currently believe that any of these other recent accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  but have entered into certain hedge transactions  primarily to limit our variable interest rate exposure 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding as of september   consisting of million of senior debt and million of notes payable to a bank 
there was approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding as of september  as required by the senior secured credit facility  we entered into agreements to limit our variable interest rate exposure 
the agreements effectively fix the libor rate at for million of this debt through september  we account for these agreements as cash flow hedges  with their fair market value reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as either other assets or other liabilities 
the market value of the hedges can fluctuate significantly over a relatively short period of time 
the hedges had a market value at september  of approximately million  which  net of related income taxes  represents other comprehensive income 
one of the joint ventures we have invested in see note to the consolidated financial statements has also entered into agreements that are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
total comprehensive income  considering all cash flow hedge agreements to which we are a direct or indirect party  was not materially different from net income for any period presented 
considering all outstanding balances of variable rate debt reduced by the million of senior debt that effectively has a fixed interest rate until september  and required principal repayments  a change in the interest rate of would change our interest expense by approximately million during the months ending september
