index to financial statements affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill acuity brands reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow of each of the company s businesses 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flow from operations 
specifically  acuity brands has two unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of million 
management estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements lower expected  future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
accordingly  an impairment charge would be recorded at that time 
to illustrate the potential impact of unfavorable changes in the assumptions underlying the fair value model  a one hundred basis point reduction in the theoretical royalty rate related to the valuation of the holophane trade name acquired in would result in a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million  or of the carrying value of the trade name 
self insurance it is the policy of acuity brands to self insure  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
based on an independent actuary s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  a provision for claims under this self insured program is revised and recorded annually 
acuity brands is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property and business interruptions resulting from such loss 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
acuity brands is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including employment practices  environmental  product recall  and patent infringement 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans 
the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan designs  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow 
share based compensation expense on september   the company adopted sfas no 
r  which requires compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued 
the company has adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and has applied it to the accounting for the company s stock options and restricted shares  and share units representing certain deferrals into the director deferred compensation plan or the supplemental deferred savings plan both of which are discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the modified prospective method  share based expense recognized after adoption includes a share based expense for all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and b share based expense for all awards granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the company recorded million  million  and million of share based expense for the years ended august    and  respectively 
prior to september   as permitted by sfas  the company accounted for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and  therefore  recorded no share based expense for employee stock options 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the company continues to account for any awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis 
sfas no 
r does not specify a preference for a type of valuation model to be used when measuring fair value of share based payments  and the company continues to employ the black scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of such awards 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures of share based awards to be estimated at time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements therefore  expense related to share based payments and recognized in fiscal has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the company s assumptions used in the black scholes model remain otherwise unaffected by the implementation of this pronouncement 
as of august   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of august   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year 
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
r was insignificant to the company s results of operations 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods  compensation expense recorded pursuant to sfas no 
r may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options as well as for the financial implications associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
product warranty acuity brands records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties  historical warranty costs have been within expectations 
however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods 
litigation acuity brands recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
the company is self insured for most environmental matters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
acuity brands is exposed to market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of acuity brands to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
the variable rate debt of acuity brands  primarily long term industrial revenue bonds  amounted to million at august  based on outstanding borrowings at year end  a increase in market interest rates at august  would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the million publicly traded fixed rate notes  the company s primary debt 
a increase in market interest rates at august  would have decreased the fair value of these notes by approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s long term debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of acuity brands are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in canada  where a portion of products sold are sourced from the united states 
a hypothetical decline in the canadian dollar of would negatively impact operating profit by approximately million 
also  a portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso would negatively impact operating profits by approximately million 
the impact of these hypothetical currency fluctuations has been calculated in isolation from any response the company would undertake to address such exchange rate changes in our foreign markets
