item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
many of the amounts and percentages in this section have been rounded for convenience of presentation  but actual recorded amounts have been used in computations 
accordingly  some information may appear not to compute accurately 
overview we develop  market and sell wireless solutions for managing and securing high value enterprise assets 
these assets include industrial vehicles  such as forklifts and airport ground support equipment  and rental vehicles 
our patented wireless asset net system  which utilizes rfid technology  addresses the needs of organizations to control  track  monitor and analyze their assets 
our solutions enable our customers to achieve tangible economic benefits by making timely  informed decisions that increase the security  productivity and efficiency of their operations 
we sell our system to both executive and division level management 
typically  our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer s organization 
ford  walgreens  the us postal service and target are all examples of this progression 
ford initially implemented our system at one plant in  which led to a blanket purchase order to deploy our system across its north american operations 
as of december   we had implemented our system on an aggregate of approximately  vehicles at ford facilities 
walgreens initially deployed our system at a single distribution center in and  as of december   had deployed our system at six distribution centers covering an aggregate of approximately vehicles 
the us postal service used the implementation of our system at one of its facilities in buffalo  new york in to form the basis of a solicitation for competitive bids for a powered vehicle management system 
based on our proposal for that program  the us postal service awarded us a national contract in to deploy our system at up to us postal service facilities nationwide 
as of december   the us postal service had placed orders for deployment of our system in of its facilities 
beginning in  target utilized our system on a limited number of vehicles at one of its facilities 
after testing our product  target entered into a contract with us to implement our system on more than vehicles in target s distribution facilities across the united states 
during the quarter ended december   we entered into contracts with rite aid and wal mart for the initial implementation of our system 
we work closely with customers like these to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise wide deployments 
although we generated net income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december  and have incurred additional net losses since inception 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
during the year ended december   we generated revenues of million  and the us postal service and ford accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
during the year ended december   we generated revenues of million  and ford  target and the us department of homeland security accounted for  and of such revenues  respectively 
our ability to increase our revenues and continue to generate net income will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to increase sales of products and services to our existing customers  convert our initial programs into larger or enterprise wide purchases by our customers  increase market acceptance and penetration of our products  and develop and commercialize new products and technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note b to our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by our management that can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider such accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by our management in these critical accounting policies are based on historical experience and other factors that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of these judgments and assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from i sales of our wireless asset net system  which includes training and technical support  ii post contract maintenance and support agreements  and iii leasing arrangements 
our system consists of on asset hardware  communication infrastructure and software 
revenue from the sale of our system is not recognized until all necessary components of the system are delivered to enable the system to function 
when there are no undeliverable elements that are essential to the functionality of the systems  revenues are recognized as each element is delivered based on the relative selling price of each element 
thereafter  revenue attributable to additional units is recognized upon delivery  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
our system is typically implemented by the customer or a third party and  as a result  revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  which usually is upon delivery of the system  pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  sales price is fixed and determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and contractual obligations have been satisfied 
in some instances  we are also responsible for providing installation services 
the additional installation services  which could be performed by third parties  are considered another element in a multi element deliverable and revenue for installation services is recognized at the time the installation is provided 
revenues from training and technical support are recognized as such services are provided 
in most of our contracts  we invoice customers once certain milestones are met 
as the systems are delivered  services are performed and all of the criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied  we recognize revenue for such systems 
the difference between revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts invoiced is recorded as unbilled receivables or deferred revenue 
should a contract contain customer acceptance terms  we do not recognize any revenue on that contract until such terms have been met as described in the agreement 
we also enter into post contract maintenance and support agreements 
revenues are recognized over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 
we also derive revenue under leasing arrangements 
such arrangements provide for monthly payments covering the system sale  maintenance  support and interest 
these arrangements meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales type leases 
accordingly  the system sale is recognized upon delivery of the system  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met as described above 
upon the recognition of revenue  an asset is established for the investment in sales type leases 
maintenance revenues and interest income are recognized monthly over the lease term 
during  we entered into a contract to implement our system on a portion of a customer s fleet of vehicles 
under the contract  we are entitled to issue sixty monthly invoices of up to  per month  each of which is contingent upon certain conditions being met 
costs directly attributable to this contract  consisting principally of engineering and manufacturing costs  were deferred until implementation of the system was completed 
the deferred costs are being charged to cost of revenue in accordance with the cost recovery method 
under the cost recovery method  the deferred contract costs are reduced in each period by an amount equal to the revenues recognized by us in that period until all of the deferred costs are written off  at which time we will recognize a gross profit  if any 
we continue to evaluate the carrying amount of the deferred costs 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
under the provisions of sfas r  companies are generally required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  and  accordingly  will be adopted by us in the first quarter of calendar year sfas r requires that compensation expense be recognized for the unvested portions of existing options granted prior to its effective date and the cost of options granted to employees after the effective date based on the fair value of the stock options at grant date 
the adoption of sfas r will materially increase our operating expenses from historical levels  resulting in reduced net income and net income per share  but will not impact our cash flows 
however  the actual impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be fully predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under our stock option plans 
the cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining contractual life of our outstanding options 
the total fair value of shares vested during the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items related to our statement of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

net income loss 
net income was  in compared to a net loss of million in net income per basic and diluted share increased to in from a loss of in this increase was due primarily to the reasons described above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our capital requirements have been funded from cash flow generated from our business and net proceeds from the issuance of our securities  including the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of options and warrants 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for same period in the increase in net cash used in operating activities was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable resulting from an increase in our revenues in  unbilled receivables under our contract with the us postal service and an increase in inventory

capital requirements we believe that the cash we have on hand and operating cash flows we expect to generate  we will have sufficient funds available to cover our capital requirements for at least the next months 
our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the length of the sales cycle  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing  and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline and potential acquisitions 
failure to generate positive cash flow from operations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may determine in the future that we require additional funds to meet our long term strategic objectives  including to complete potential acquisitions 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants  and we cannot assure you that such financing will be extended on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we have filed a registration statement on forms s with the sec in connection with a proposed public offering of  shares of our common stock  subject to over allotment option with respect to an additional  shares of our common stock 
however  we cannot assure you as to the timing or the final terms of the offering  or whether or not the offering will be consummated 
line of credit and term loan we have a working capital line of credit  with maximum borrowings of  and interest at the day libor plus that is payable monthly 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this line of credit  which expires on may  in january  we closed on a five year amortizing term loan for million 
interest accrues at the day libor plus and is payable monthly  together with principal 
we have eliminated our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by entering into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the rate of interest on our term loan at for the entire five year term 
as of december   there was  outstanding on the loan 
the loan is collateralized by all of our assets and contains a liquidity covenant that was permanently waived as of january  the loan agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants including  among others  limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and the creation of encumbrances on our assets 
the fair value of the interest rate swap is not material to the financial statements or results of operations 
as of december   maturities of long term debt were as follows contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period total less than one year to years to years after years long term debt obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
although we have entered into contracts for services  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing or payment of obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
inflation we believe our operations have not been and  in the foreseeable future  will not be materially and adversely affected by inflation or changing prices 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors
