item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were established in early to develop proprietary polymer materials and products based on these materials for two primary markets bioscience and electro optics 
we design and synthesize polymer materials at the molecular level by using our expertise in nanotechnology  which is the development of products and production processes at a scale smaller than nanometers a nanometer is one billionth of a meter 
our goal is to optimize the electrical  optical and surface properties of these materials 
we use these materials to improve the design  performance and functionality of products for use in biochemical analysis and in optical communications networks and systems 
we believe we have developed a proprietary intellectual property position based on a combination of patents  licenses and trade secrets relating to the design and characterization of polymer materials  methods of polymer synthesis and production of polymers in commercial quantities  as well as device design  characterization  fabrication  testing and packaging technology 
from inception through  we concentrated primarily on the development of our technology and potential products 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have come from contracts to develop custom made electro optic materials and devices for government agencies 
as we transition to a product based company we expect to record both revenue and expense from product sales  to incur increased costs for sales and marketing and to increase general and administrative expense 
accordingly  the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements are not expected to be indicative of our future financial condition and results of operations 
until december   we were considered to be in the development stage 
products for wireless networking and biochip applications became available for customer evaluation in early  therefore  we were was considered to have exited the development stage in in  we also began the development of our label free  high throughput detection system and related biochip products aimed primarily at the growing proteomics marketplace 
we also continued the development of our polymer modulators  and pending demand for higher bandwidth and speeds from optical communications equipment suppliers  we have been developing other applications for our modulators such as terahertz imaging systems 
we currently have products being evaluated by customers and potential customers in each of our product areas 
we were a subsidiary of microvision  inc from our inception in early through our public offering in july until december  we obtained certain administrative services from microvision through an inter company services arrangement 
our facilities are currently subleased from microvision through april  we have entered into a lease agreement which expands our current facility beginning on april  the following table reflects lease payments made to microvision and for other services under the former microvision agreement during  and rent allocated services management fees total results of operations revenue 
substantially all of our revenue since inception has been generated from cost plus fixed fee development contracts with several united states government agencies or with government contractors 
our projects have primarily been to develop specialized electro optic polymer materials and devices 
the following table summarizes the various contract awards we have received since its inception and the related revenue recognized wideband polymer modulator polymer based linear modulator electro optic organic polymer polymer based milimeter wave detection other award revenue award revenue award revenue award revenue award revenue backlog on our governmental contracts totaled  at december  our revenue from government contracting has fluctuated year to year and we expect that future periods could also fluctuate significantly 
we also generate revenue through sales of our products to research institutes both private and in universities  original equipment manufacturers oems  drug discovery and or diagnostic companies  industry partners and through development contracts 
we expect that future revenue from us government contracts will decrease as a percentage of revenue and that product revenue from the sale of commercial products will increase both on a dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue in future years 
revenue from product shipments was less than of total revenues for all years 
cost of revenue 
historically  cost of revenue has consisted primarily of the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing specific projects 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with our research and product development efforts and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
the cost of revenue can fluctuate substantially from period to period depending on the level of both the direct costs incurred in the performance of projects and the level of indirect costs incurred 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the contract mix  the cost of future planned products and the level of direct and indirect cost incurred 
cost of product revenue includes direct labor and material costs and allocated indirect costs 
we currently utilize our research and development facilities to manufacture its products until demand for these products justify separate manufacturing facilities 
indirect cost is allocated to the cost of product revenues based upon direct labor required during the manufacturing process  but only to the extent of product revenue 
we record product costs in excess of revenues as research and development costs 
we expect that cost of revenue on a dollar basis will increase in the future as a result of anticipated sales of products  additional development contract work that we expect to perform  and commensurate growth in our personnel and technical capacity required to perform on these contracts 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation for employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  research fees paid to the university of washington and other educational institutions for contract research  stock based research expense relating to grants of common stock made to the university of washington  laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  costs incurred in acquiring and maintaining licenses  and related operating expenses 
a significant portion of our research and development expense through june related to cash payments and a grant of common stock pursuant to our sponsored research agreement with the university of washington the uw 
we issued  shares of common stock in january to uw  recognizing million of research expense through february cash payments under the sponsored research agreement  following several amendments  totaled million 
we have ongoing minimum royalty obligations required by a technology licensing agreement with the uw totaling  annually 
we are currently funding researchers at the uw and other institutions to conduct ongoing research activities on a project basis 
funding under these various projects during totaled approximately  we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expense to develop commercial products using polymer materials technology 
these expenses could increase as a result of continued development and commercialization of our polymer materials technology  including subcontracting work to potential development partners  expanding and equipping in house laboratories  acquiring rights to additional technologies  hiring additional technical and support personnel and pursuing other potential business opportunities 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and support costs for management and administrative staff  and for other general and administrative costs  including accounting and legal fees  consulting fees and other operating expenses 
it also consists of costs associated with corporate awareness campaigns such as web site development and participation at trade shows  corporate communications initiatives and efforts with potential customers and joint venture partners to identify and evaluate product applications in which our technology could be integrated or otherwise used 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expense to increase in and beyond as we increase our product development and marketing staff to define  qualify  develop and market products that we commercialize  increase our sales staff to begin and develop customer relationships and sell our products in various geographies and marketplaces  and increase the level of corporate and administrative activity  including increases associated with our operation as a public company 
interest income and expense 
interest income consists of earnings from investment securities 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in other income 
interest expense during consisted of interest accrued on our convertible promissory notes issued in april  which were repaid upon completion of our initial public offering 
income taxes 
from inception through december   we have generated federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and research and development credits of approximately million 
our net operating loss carry forwards begin expiring in through in some circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to use a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its potential future tax benefits 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  contract losses  bad debts  investments and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies require our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this revenue recognition methodology because we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion and actual revenue and cost become certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
contract estimates we estimate contract costs based on the experience of our professional researchers  the experience we have obtained in our internal research efforts  and our performance on previous contracts 
we believe this allows us to reasonably estimate the tasks required and the contract costs  however  there are uncertainties in estimating these costs  such as the ability to identify precisely the underlying technical issues hindering development of the technology  the ability to predict all the technical factors that may affect successful completion of the proposed tasks  and the ability to retain researchers having enough experience to complete the proposed tasks in a timely manner 
should actual costs differ materially from our estimates  we may have to adjust the timing and amount of revenue we recognize 
to date  we have mitigated the risk of failing to perform under these contracts by negotiating best efforts provisions  which do not obligate us to complete contract deliverables 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  revenue on government contracts  which totaled  in  increased by  over   of this additional revenue related to contracts that were continuing from and  related to contracts awarded in product sales revenues totaled  for compared to  in product sales during consisted entirely of sample sized orders of products used in further development efforts or commercial feasibility studies 
our contract revenue backlog totaled  on two government contracts 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of contract revenue  which totaled  in increased by  over due primarily to higher labor costs and overhead allocations associated with higher levels of government contract activities during cost of product revenue totaled  in research and development expense 
research and development expense increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  expenses associated with our various agreements with the university of washington increased by approximately million in from expenses under our sponsored research agreement with the university of washington  which ended during  totaled  compared to a net benefit of million in in  we recorded a million benefit in to reduce previously expensed costs as a result of an amended payment schedule which reduced total required payments to the uw from million under the terms of the original agreement to million 
consulting fees associated primarily with device and package design  which totaled  in  increased by  over license and royalty fees associated primarily with our sensium license agreement were  higher in and materials and supplies were  higher in amortization of non cash stock based compensation expense associated with stock options granted to research personnel during at prices below market value totaled  during  down  from  during expenses associated with technology transfer and patent expense reimbursement with arizona microsystems totaled  in in addition  labor and related overhead costs applied to the cost of government contracts was  higher in leading to a decline in research and development expense 
the following table summarizes the payments made and expenses recognized under the various uw agreements for the comparative periods payments made sponsored research optical materials research minimum royalty expenses recorded on payments amortization of stock total expense recorded marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increased expense during which primarily relate to our first full year as a stand alone public company were audit  legal  insurance and investor relations activities which were  higher in additionally  expenses associated with additional finance  sales and marketing headcount increased by  and general and administrative expenses increased by  in non cash amortization expenses related to stock option grants at below market prices declined by  in incentive compensation expenses related to declined by  to align expected payouts with performance 
in we incurred  of financial consulting expense associated with fundraising activities which did not recur in interest income 
interest income increased  to  for the year ended december  from  in due to higher levels of investments following our public offering in july interest expense 
there was no interest expense in interest expense in totaled  due primarily to interest on  of convertible notes issued in april the notes were repaid in august following our public offering 
we incurred  of interest expense associated with the notes in   of which was paid in cash for the stated interest on the notes and  of non cash debt issuance costs associated with the value of the warrants issued with the notes 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due primarily to a government sub contract awarded during that was not renewed for we recognized  of revenue on this contract during also contributing to the decline in revenues were two government contracts that we ceased working on during the fourth quarter while both contracts entered the renewal phase  causing a delay in billable revenue 
both of these contracts  together valued at million  have been renewed for work we expect to perform and bill in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due primarily to lower labor costs  which declined by  and overhead allocations which declined by  due to lower levels of government contract activities during research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  net expenses associated with our various agreements with the university of washington declined by approximately million in from in april  the sponsored research agreement sra with the university of washington was amended  reducing the total payment amount required under the agreement from million to million  and eliminating a contingent payment of million which was originally due in may we recorded a million benefit in to bring previously expensed costs in line with the amended payment schedule 
apart from the one time benefit  expenses recognized under the uw agreement  including sra and stock amortization costs  totaled million in compared with million in cash payments under the uw agreement totaled  in compared with million in the following table summarizes the payments made and expenses recognized under the various uw agreements for the comparative periods payments made sponsored research optical materials minimum royalty expenses recorded on payments amortization of stock total expense recorded non cash stock based compensation expense associated with stock options granted to research personnel during at prices below market value totaled  up from  during we also incurred  more expense related to technology transfer and patent expense reimbursement with arizona micro systems in in addition  we applied more resources to product development efforts in resulting in labor and research costs which were approximately  higher in compared to marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increased expense during was primarily attributable to non cash amortization for stock options granted in april at below market prices of  expenses for additional marketing and finance personnel totaling  higher cash incentive compensation costs of  higher audit and legal fees which increased by  and other cost increases primarily related to being a public company which were approximately  interest income 
interest income increased  to  for the year ended december  from  in due to higher levels of investments following our public offering in july interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  in april  we issued  of convertible notes together with warrants to purchase common stock 
the notes were repaid in august following our public offering 
we incurred  of interest expense associated with the notes in   of which was paid in cash for the stated interest on the notes and  of non cash debt issuance costs associated with the value of the warrants 
there was no interest expense in deemed dividend upon issuance of preferred stock 
in march  we raised cash proceeds of  from the sale of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock to private investors 
the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock issued was less than the fair value of the class a common stock on the issuance date 
as a result  we recorded a  beneficial conversion feature upon issuance of the preferred stock 
this amount was immediately recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders because the series b preferred stock had no stated term and was immediately convertible into class a common stock 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock and convertible preferred stock and  to a lesser extent  through revenues from development contracts and sales of products 
our accumulated deficit  which represents the cumulative net loss since our inception  totaled million at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities held for sale at december   all of which are classified as short term with maturities less than months beyond the balance sheet date 
we used million  million and million in cash to fund operating activities during the years ending december   and  respectively 
the cash required to fund our operations during increased by  over due primarily to higher spending on research and development and certain general administrative expenses totaling million  partially reduced by higher net interest income of  and increased gross margin on contract and product revenues of  we spent approximately million more on certain research and development activities in primarily on consulting fees related to device and package design activities of  on license and minimum royalty expenses associated with our sensium license agreement of  on materials and supplies expenses associated with research and product commercialization activities in our labs of  partially offsetting the effect of these increases were higher levels of labor and related overhead costs classified to the cost of government contracts of  lower fees paid for contract research of  and lower employee incentive compensation costs of  we spent approximately million more on marketing  general and administrative costs primarily on higher audit and legal fees  public relations and insurance expenses  most of which are related to being a public company  of  on higher headcount related expenses associated with finance  sales and marketing personnel of  and on increased general administrative expenses of  partially offsetting the effect of these increases were lower management and employee incentive compensation expenses of  and lower expenses associated with the cessation of support we received from our former parent company of  on a quarterly basis during we used approximately million  million  million and million for each of the four sequential quarters  respectively 
we used more cash in the first half of due primarily to contract research payments to the uw under our sponsored research agreement which ended in june  higher audit fees and payments which are required during the first quarter under our sensium license agreement 
we used less cash in the latter half of due partly to lower research and professional fee payments and to increased gross margin on higher revenues and higher interest income which reflects increasing market interest rates 
our cash usage in will likely be higher than due in part to expenditures required under our new facilities operating lease 
we set aside  in cash in january in a separate commercial bank to satisfy the letter of credit collateral provisions under the terms of the lease 
we also anticipate that incremental capital expenditures related to completing tenant improvements and related equipment costs in our new facility will range from to million  mostly during the second quarter of the cash required to fund our operations during increased by million over due primarily to higher spending on headcount related expenses associated with executive  finance and marketing personnel of million  on legal  audit and consulting fees  most of which are related to being a public company  of  and on higher insurance and other prepaid costs of  investing activities provided cash totaling million in and million in  investing activities used million in cash in the cash provided in was primarily due to the sale of investment securities  net or reinvestments 
the cash used in was primarily due to net investments of cash following our initial public offering in july the cash provided in was obtained from the issuance of manditorily redeemable preferred stock 
we used  to purchase capital equipment in compared with  and  in and  respectively 
historically  capital expenditures have been used to make leasehold improvements to leased office space and to purchase production equipment  computer hardware and software  laboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures to support our growth 
capital expenditures will increase during as we make leasehold improvements in our new facilities and in the future as we continue to expand our operations 
financing activities provided cash totaling  in and million in during  we received  from the exercise of stock options and in return we issued  shares of our common stock 
during we received million in cash from the following activities in march  we raised  from the sale of series b preferred stock 
in april  we issued million of convertible promissory notes  together with warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
these notes were payable on demand upon completion of our public offering 
the warrants carry an exercise price of and expire in all of the notes were repaid following our july stock offering 
in july we completed our ipo raising million  net of underwriter s discounts and offering expenses 
during we received million in cash from the sales of series b preferred stock 
our future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development efforts  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with original equipment manufacturers  introduce and sell products incorporating our polymer materials technology  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  market acceptance of our products and competing technological developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
we expect that our cash used in operations will increase during  compared to  and beyond as a result of increased production spending as our products are accepted and sold  increased spending on marketing activities as our products are introduced into our target markets  the addition of sales  marketing  technical and other staff to sell products  meet production needs and continue with future development efforts  build out of our additional facilities during the second and third quarters of  purchases of additional laboratory and production equipment  the development of strategic relationships with systems and equipment manufacturers  and increased general and administrative activities related to our operations as a public company and related corporate compliance requirements 
our business does not presently generate the cash needed to finance our current and anticipated operations 
we expect that cash and investments held for sale  along with revenues from our existing contractual relationships  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the end of see risk factors 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced  and these securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
the following table lists our contractual obligations as of december  year ending december  there after contractual obligations operating leases minimum payments under research  royalty and licensing agreements total royalty and license obligations continue through the lives of the underlying patents 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
in april  the securities and exchange commission the sec postponed the effective date of sfas r until the issuer s first fiscal year beginning after june  beginning in january we will be recording expenses associated with share based awards under the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  we will record not only the fair value associated with new share based awards as compensation expense  but also the remaining fair value associated with previous awards which were unvested at the end of as of december  the fair value associated with unvested stock option grants given to employees in periods before was approximately  which will be expensed through we expect that the adoption of fas r on january  will impact earnings in the range of million to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment policy restricts the types of investments we make to ensure principal preservation and liquidity 
our cash investments  which are all classified as available for sale according to their various maturity dates  are recorded on our balance sheet at their fair value 
any unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income loss 
we do not leverage any of our investments  nor do we hold them for the purpose of trading 
we invest so that approximately days of operating expenses are either held in cash or are within days of maturity 
substantially all of our cash equivalents and investment securities are at fixed interest rates and  as such  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
due to the generally short term maturities of these investment securities  we believe that the market risk arising from its holdings of these financial instruments is not significant 
a one percent change in market interest rates would have approximately a  impact on the fair value of the investment securities
