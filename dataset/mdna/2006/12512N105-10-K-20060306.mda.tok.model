item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview we are a leading direct marketer of multi brand information technology products and services in the united states 
our primary business is conducted from a combined corporate office and distribution center located in vernon hills  illinois  sales offices in illinois  virginia  connecticut  new jersey  and toronto  canada  and a distribution center in north las vegas  nevada 
additionally  we market and sell products through cdw 
com  cdwg 
com  macwarehouse 
com and cdw 
ca  our web sites 
for financial reporting purposes  we have two operating segments corporate sector  which is primarily comprised of business customers  but also includes consumers which generated approximately and of net sales in and  respectively  and public sector  which is comprised of federal  state and local government entities  educational institutions and healthcare customers 
in the first quarter of  we revised our operating segments  which reflect the basis for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
in july  the company announced the creation of a dedicated healthcare sales team 
for financial reporting purposes  results of operations and assets related to healthcare customers are reported as part of the public sector segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our operating segments 
cdw management monitors a number of financial and non financial measures and ratios on a daily  weekly  and monthly basis in order to track the progress of the business and make adjustments as necessary 
we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include daily sales  by business segment and total company  gross margin  number of orders shipped per day  number of orders shipped complete per day  inventory balance and turnover  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance  accounts receivable balance and aging  accounts receivable days sales outstanding  operating expenses and operating margin 
the measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management  so that actions can be taken  as necessary  in order to achieve the standards and objectives 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the estimates and assumptions used in accounting for revenue recognition  inventory valuation and vendor transactions have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  and therefore  are considered to be our critical accounting policies 
the following discussion details the estimates and assumptions associated with these policies 
revenue recognition 
we record revenues from sales transactions when both risk of loss and title to products sold pass to the customer 
our shipping terms dictate that the passage of title occurs upon receipt of products by the customer 
the majority of our revenues relate to physical products and are recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as net sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales 
software assurance products  third party services and extended warranties that we sell for which we are not the primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  such revenues are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period  based on the nature of the contract  at the net amount retained by us  with no cost of sales 

table of contents in accordance with this revenue recognition policy  we estimate the value of products that have shipped but that have not been received by the customer and record an adjustment to reverse the impact of these sales out of our results for the current period and into our results for the subsequent period 
in doing so  we perform an analysis to determine the estimated number of days that product is in transit  using data from commercial delivery services and other sources 
changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the current period 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
vendor transactions 
we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates  bid programs  price protection and other programs 
these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or net advertising expense  as appropriate 
vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 
the inability to collect receivables related to these vendor transactions could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 
in september  we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse  a reseller of computers  software and peripheral products 
the us transaction  completed on september   was accounted for as a purchase of assets  with the million purchase price allocated to the assets purchased  including inventory  fixed assets  and customer lists  based upon their fair values at the date of purchase 
subsequent to the completion of the us transaction  sales made by former members of the micro warehouse us sales force who joined cdw in conjunction with this transaction  along with the associated costs  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the canadian transaction  completed on september   was accounted for as the purchase of a business and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired business subsequent to the date of purchase are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the assumed assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair values at the date of purchase 
the canadian operations were purchased for million 
recently issued or newly adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the company to measure all share based payments to coworkers under our stock based compensation plans using a fair value based method and record compensation expense related to these payments in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r is effective for the first annual period beginning after june   therefore  we are required to adopt sfas r for the year beginning january  the pro forma disclosures previously required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we intend to use the modified prospective application transition method upon adopting sfas r  which allows for prospective recognition of compensation expense without restatement of prior periods in the year of adoption 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have accounted for our stock based compensation programs according to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
accordingly  compensation expense is recognized to the extent of employee or director services rendered based on the intrinsic value of compensatory options or shares granted under the plans 
historically  stock options have been granted annually to all cdw coworkers as part of the company s overall compensation plan 
as announced on april   after studying the potential impact of sfas r 
table of contents and taking into consideration the results of coworker surveys and focus groups  the compensation and stock option committee the committee of the company s board of directors approved certain modifications to the company s compensation structure 
as modified  the company s compensation structure for coworkers includes the following features cdw officers  directors and managers will participate in the company s employee stock option plan on an annual basis 
except as noted below  these grants will be determined in a manner consistent with how prior grants have been determined 
coworkers below manager level will no longer be granted options on an annual basis 
there may be minor  discrete grants made to specific coworkers below manager level in recognition of outstanding performance or significant contribution to the company 
all coworkers will be eligible for an additional discretionary profit sharing contribution from the company to the cdw corporation employees profit sharing plan the plan 
the amount of the discretionary contribution  if any  will be determined annually by the committee 
the committee approved a  profit sharing contribution with respect to each coworker who was eligible to participate in the plan and was employed on december  the cost of this contribution was approximately million pre tax and was recognized equally over the months of april through december in  cdw officers  directors and managers have  as an offset to the increased contribution  received slightly fewer options than they otherwise would have received 
all unvested options granted prior to january  held by coworkers at the manager level and below who were employed on december  became fully vested effective december  in connection with the acceleration of vesting  the company recorded a charge of million pre tax in the fourth quarter of the acceleration of vesting was undertaken primarily so that compensation expense for the accelerated options will not be recognized in the company s income statement in future periods upon adoption of sfas r 
it is estimated that the compensation expense for stock options will be approximately to million pre tax in this estimate is based on an assumption regarding the number of stock options that would be forfeited and an assumption of the number of options that would be granted in and the valuation of such stock options at the time of grant 
the estimated stock based compensation expense for does not include the expense for any additional discretionary profit sharing contribution the company may make to the plan for similar to the contribution to be made for  as described above 
in addition  after studying the potential impact of sfas r  certain modifications to the company s employee stock purchase plan espp were approved 
the espp provided that eligible coworkers may contribute up to of their eligible compensation towards the quarterly purchase of our common stock 
historically  the coworkers purchase price was of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first business day or the last business day of the quarterly offering period 
effective january   the coworkers purchase price will be of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period

in  of cooperative advertising funds were classified as a reduction of cost of sales rather than a reduction of advertising expense  compared to in our objective for gross profit as a percentage of net sales is between and 
the gross profit margin depends on various factors  including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs  cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales  product mix  including third party services  pricing strategies  market conditions  and other factors  any of which could result in changes in gross margins from recent experience 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  while increasing as a percentage of net sales to versus in included in selling and administrative expenses in were million of transaction and integration expenses related to the micro warehouse transactions 
the primary drivers of the increase in selling and administrative expenses are discussed below 
payroll costs increased million  primarily due to our continued investment in our sales force and increases in administrative areas to support a larger and growing business 
our sales force increased to  at december   from  at december  our sales force consists of account managers including field sales representatives as well as product category specialists who provide consultation in areas requiring technical or specialized product expertise such as networking  security  data storage  and volume software licensing 
in addition  payroll costs for include million of compensation expense in connection with the acceleration of vesting of stock options for coworkers through the manager level 
payroll costs for included million of expenses for former micro warehouse employees performing transition services 
employee related costs which include items such as profit sharing  incentive awards  and insurance increased million  primarily due to million of additional profit sharing expense discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements related to the additional contribution to the k plan in conjunction with a modification to the company s stock option program and increased expenses to support a larger number of coworkers 
these expenses were partially offset by a reduction of million in an accrual for a company wide incentive bonus program 
the accrual was adjusted based on certain program modifications which provided for specific payout levels for partial achievement of full year financial objectives 
occupancy costs increased million 
this increase was primarily due to increased depreciation related to asset additions for new sales offices and new financial systems  partially offset by reduced rent 
occupancy costs for included million of facility expenses related to the micro warehouse transactions 

table of contents other selling and administrative costs increased million 
the increase was primarily due to increased administrative expenses required to support a larger business  such as professional fees and travel and entertainment expenses 
other selling and administrative costs for included million of costs related to the micro warehouse transactions 
net advertising expense increased to million in  compared to million in this was due to an increase in gross advertising expense and an increase in cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales rather than as a reduction of advertising expense in compared to as a percentage of net sales  net advertising expense increased to in  compared to in consolidated operating income was million in  a increase from million in consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in corporate sector segment operating income was million in  a increase from million in the increase in corporate sector segment operating income was primarily due to an increase in sales  partially offset by increased expenses related to the ongoing investment in the sales force

headquarters expenses also included million of compensation expense in connection with the acceleration of vesting of stock options for coworkers through the manager level and the impact of a million reduction in an accrual for a company wide incentive bonus program 
our new distribution center in north las vegas  nevada became operational in december discussed in the working capital section 
in addition  we will be adding leased office space  primarily in the chicago area  for sales and support functions 
the new distribution center and additional office space represent infrastructure investments that are necessary to support our future growth 
however  these investments will impact selling and administrative expenses and operating income in total selling and administrative expenses for these investments are estimated at approximately million in  which would represent an increase of approximately million over expenses 
as a result of the increased expenses related to the infrastructure investments  the expenses related to stock based compensation under sfas r and anticipated increased payroll tax expense related to stock option exercises due to stock options for which vesting was accelerated as of december   we have modified our objective for operating income as a percentage of net sales to a range of to for we expect to be at the lower end of this range in the first quarter  however  our objective is to be at the higher end of this range in the fourth quarter 
excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense under sfas r approximately to million pre tax and the payroll tax expense applicable to stock option exercises related to options for which vesting was accelerated approximately to million pre tax  and therefore  on a non gaap basis  this range is to for the non gaap objective for operating income as a percentage of net sales is included in this discussion because the company believes it provides a meaningful comparison to reported results of prior periods 
the effective income tax rate  expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes  decreased to in compared to in on april   we voluntarily began collecting sales taxes on sales to all corporate customers in all states that impose sales taxes 
prior to april   we collected sales tax when applicable on sales to corporate customers only in states where the requisite nexus existed 
in conjunction with collecting state sales tax  we began filing state income tax returns for all of our legal entities in all states 
due to differences in state income tax laws  including differences in how income is apportioned  we expected our overall effective tax rate to be lower in than the change in the effective tax rate increased diluted earnings per share in by approximately compared to the effective tax rate for is estimated at 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to increased state income taxes due to rate and law changes 

table of contents net income in was million  a increase from million in diluted earnings per share were in  an increase of from in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales in increased to billion  compared to billion in the increase in net sales was due to organic growth and the fact that included a full year of sales made by former members of the micro warehouse sales force who joined cdw in september in conjunction with the micro warehouse transactions

vendor incentives increased due to achieving goals set by our vendor partners 
cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales increased due to a higher level of cooperative advertising funds received from our vendors and the classification of a higher percentage of these funds as a reduction of cost of sales rather than as a reduction of advertising expense in the increase in net service contract revenue was due to higher sales of products accounted for on a net basis  such as warranties and software assurance products

in contrast  sales in our public sector segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters due to the buying patterns of federal government and education customers 
if sales to federal government and education customers increase as a percentage of overall sales  the company as a whole may experience increased seasonality in future periods
