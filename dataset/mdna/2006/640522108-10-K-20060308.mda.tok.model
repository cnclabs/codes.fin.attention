item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company using our enzymatic technologies to develop proprietary drugs  focusing primarily on therapeutic proteins 
we believe that our core enzymatic technologies  glycoadvance and glycopegylation  improve the drug properties of therapeutic proteins by building out  and attaching polyethylene glycol peg to  carbohydrate structures on the proteins 
we are using our technologies to develop proprietary versions of protein drugs with proven safety and efficacy and to improve the therapeutic profiles of proteins being developed by our partners 
we expect these modified proteins to offer significant advantages  including less frequent dosing and possibly improved efficacy  over the original versions of the drugs now on the market  as well as to meet or exceed the pharmacokinetic profile of next generation versions of the drugs now on the market 
we believe this strategy of targeting drugs with proven safety and efficacy allows us to lower the risk profile of our proprietary development portfolio as compared to de novo protein drug development 
we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we expect additional losses in and over the next several years as we continue product research and development efforts and expand our intellectual property portfolio 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and cash equivalents sooner than the above estimate 
under agreements we entered into with a bank during the first quarter of  we have agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to  as of december   our total outstanding debt was  in march  we entered into amendments of our agreements with the bank 
these amendments  effective march   revised the minimum liquidity requirements  increased the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance and added a prepayment premium to be paid in the event we repay the loan earlier than as set forth in the agreements 
pursuant to the amendments  if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million  the bank has the option to require us to make a payment to reduce the outstanding balance under the credit facility to million 
if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million  the bank has the option to require us to make a payment to reduce the outstanding balance under the credit facility to million 
finally  if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million we will be considered to be in default of the credit facility and the bank may take certain actions in relation to that default  including  but not limited to  requiring us to repay the entire outstanding balance under the credit facility 
see financing activities debt financing activities term loan from bank and industrial development authority bond in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k for a description of the material features of this borrowing 
liquidity and capital resources overview we had  in cash and cash equivalents as of december   compared to  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  the decrease for was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and debt repayments  which were partly offset by proceeds of equity and debt financings 
during  we anticipate our average quarterly spending of approximately million to million to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and debt repayments  without giving effect to the impact of entering into any new collaborative agreements or disposing of our current headquarters and manufacturing facility 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through accordingly  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to avoid violating the debt covenant described above and to fund our operations until we are generating sufficient cash flow from operations 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required  we may need to delay  scale back  or eliminate some of our research and development programs 
the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics  which we are pursuing both independently and in collaboration with selected partners  will require substantial expenditures by us and our collaborators 
we plan to continue financing our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from existing and future collaborative agreements 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 
other than revenues from our collaborations with novo nordisk and biogenerix  and any future collaborations with others  we do not expect to generate significant revenues until such time as products using our technologies are commercialized  which is not expected during the next several years 
we expect an additional several years to elapse before we can expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operating and investing requirements 
accordingly  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our operations until we are generating sufficient cash flow from operations 
restructuring in august  we implemented a restructuring of operations to enable an enhanced focus on next generation proteins  to allow for the anticipated transfer of production of proteins and reagents to our collaborative partners and contract manufacturers now that our programs are more mature  and to reduce cash burn 
our future requirements for internally manufactured products will be substantially lower than the capacity of our  square foot pilot manufacturing facility 
therefore  we commenced efforts to dispose of our current headquarters and pilot manufacturing facility witmer road facility  which we own subject to mortgages supporting our term loan and industrial development authority bond both are more fully described in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k under the heading financing activities debt financing activities term loan from bank and industrial development authority bond 
upon completion of the restructuring  we had reduced the size of our workforce by approximately since the end of the first quarter of our net loss for included  of charges related to this restructuring  including  of non cash property and equipment impairment charges and  of payments for employee severance and facility closure costs 
we expect to realize annualized savings from the restructuring of between  and  property and equipment impairment charges as a result of our decision to dispose of the witmer road facility  we concluded that identifiable cash flows could be assigned to the witmer road facility and related equipment 
to determine the appropriate carrying value of these assets  we used a probability weighted approach of estimated cash flows to be received upon a range of possible disposition outcomes 
we based our estimates of potential cash flows related to possible disposition outcomes on conversations with commercial real estate firms that have both knowledge of recent history of sales and expertise in marketing and selling similar facilities 
based on those estimates  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  which was included in restructuring charges on our statements of operations  on our witmer road facility and related equipment 
also as part of the restructuring  we centralized research activities in horsham  pennsylvania by ending operations in our leased facility in san diego  california 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  which was also included in restructuring charges on our statements of operations  related to property and equipment located in the san diego facility 
employee severance and facility closure costs during  we recorded  which was also included in restructuring charges on our statements of operations  of employee severance costs related to the restructuring 
we also recorded a facility closure charge of  in restructuring charges on our statements of operations for the operating lease related to the san diego facility 
this charge was based on an estimate of the present value of the loss we would incur over the remaining term of the lease 
because the remaining lease term extended for only five months beyond our cease use date of the facility  we assumed no sublease income in our calculation 
operating activities during  our operating activities consumed cash of  compared to  in the decrease of  in net cash consumed for operating activities is substantially the result of  of cash provided during compared to  of cash used during to fund changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily due to a decrease of  in accounts receivable during also contributing to a decrease in net cash consumed by operating activities was an increase in net interest income of  during compared to fluctuations in operating items vary period to period due to  among other factors  the timing of research and development activities  such as the preparation and initiation of preclinical trials 
investing activities during and  cash expenditures for property  plant  and equipment were  and  respectively 
the facility improvement project described below contributed significantly to our capital expenditures during we entered into a lease agreement in for a  square foot building  which we intended to convert into laboratory and office space 
later in  we suspended plans to complete these renovations 
in november  we reinitiated renovation activities on approximately  square feet of the facility  leaving approximately  square feet available for future expansion 
in april  we occupied the facility and began amortizing the cost of  of the improvements 
during  we entered into agreements with a bank for the purpose of funding these improvements 
see financing activities debt financing activities term loan from bank and industrial development authority bond below for a description of the material features of this borrowing 
in  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately  to  excluding the cost of any leasehold improvements we need in order to accomplish a consolidation of our research  development and administrative operations upon the disposition of our current headquarters and pilot manufacturing facility witmer road facility 
see restructuring above for a discussion of our efforts to dispose of the witmer road facility 
we may finance some or all of these capital expenditures through capital leases or the issuance of new debt or equity 
we may finance capital expenditures through the issuance of new debt  to the extent that we are allowed to do so under our existing bank covenants 
the terms of new debt could require us to maintain a minimum cash and investments balance  or to transfer cash into an escrow account to collateralize some portion of the debt  or both 
financing activities equity financing activities in february  we offered and sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating net proceeds of  in may  we sold  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a number of institutional and individual investors  including  shares sold to officers and an investment fund affiliated with a director  at a price of per share  generating net proceeds of  debt financing activities our total debt decreased by  to  at december   compared to  at december  this decrease primarily resulted from  of debt principal repayments during partially offsetting the debt repayments were  in proceeds from the issuance of debt during note payable secured by insurance policies in march  we borrowed  to finance the insurance policy premiums due on certain insurance policies 
we made the last payment in december and  therefore  there was no outstanding principal balance under this agreement as of december  the interest was calculated based on an annual percentage rate of 
to secure payment of the amounts financed  we granted the lender a security interest in all of our right  title and interest to the insurance policies 
term loan from bank and industrial development authority bond during the first quarter of  we and a bank entered into agreements under which the bank acquired and reissued the  outstanding of our tax exempt industrial development authority bond 
in addition  we borrowed  from the bank  of which  funded improvements to our leased facility  which we occupied in april  in horsham  pa 
as of december   we owed the bank  as discussed in restructuring above  we have commenced efforts to dispose of our current headquarters and pilot manufacturing facility witmer road facility 
if we dispose of the witmer road facility  we will be required to repay the outstanding balance to the bank  whether or not the proceeds from the disposition of the facility exceed the outstanding loan balance 
during  we will be required to make principal payments totaling  under these agreements 
the interest rate on the bond and bank debt varies quarterly  depending on day libor rates 
at december   the day libor was 
we have the option each quarter to incur interest on the outstanding principal at the libor based variable interest rate or a fixed rate offered by our bank 
for the  term loan  interest accrues at an interest rate equal to the day libor plus 
during  the weighted average annual interest rate for the term loan was 
we made quarterly  interest only payments prior to march  commencing on march   we began to make quarterly principal payments of  plus interest 
we are required to make these payments over the remaining term of the ten year loan period 
pursuant to the amendments to our agreements with the bank discussed below  after march   interest on the term loan began to accrue at an interest rate equal to the day libor plus 
for the  industrial development authority bond  we are making quarterly  interest only payments for ten years at an interest rate equal to the day libor plus  followed by a single repayment of principal at the end of the ten year loan period 
if the day libor at the beginning of any calendar quarter is between and  the bond will bear interest at the day libor plus 
if the day libor at the beginning of any calendar quarter exceeds  the bond will bear interest at the day libor plus 
during  the weighted average annual interest rate for the bond was 
pursuant to the amendments to our agreements with the bank discussed below  after march   interest on the industrial development authority bond began to accrue at an interest rate equal to the day libor plus 
to provide security for these borrowings  we granted a first mortgage to our bank on the land and building where our present headquarters are located  as well as a security interest of first priority on certain improvements  certain equipment  and other tangible personal property 
under our agreements with the bank  if the bank determines a material adverse change has occurred in our business  financial condition  results of operations  or business prospects  the bank in its sole discretion may declare at any time an event of default  of which one potential outcome could be the accelerated repayment of the loan balance  which was  as of december  under our agreements with the bank  we agreed to limit our total outstanding debt to  as of december   our total outstanding debt was  prior to the execution of the amendments discussed below  at any time after january   or if we failed to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least  our bank would have had the option to require additional collateral from us in the form of a security interest in certain cash and short term investments  or in the form of a letter of credit 
the agreements with our bank also contain covenants that  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the bank prior to paying dividends  making certain investments  changing the nature of our business  assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual  selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets  and merging or consolidating with another entity 
in march  we entered into amendments of our agreements with the bank 
these amendments  effective march   revised the minimum liquidity requirements  increased the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance and added a prepayment premium to be paid in the event we repay the loan earlier than as set forth in the agreements 
pursuant to the amendments  if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million  the bank has the option to require us to make a payment to reduce the outstanding balance under the credit facility to million 
if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million  the bank has the option to require us to make a payment to reduce the outstanding balance under the credit facility to million 
finally  if we fail at any time to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least million we will be considered to be in default of the credit facility and the bank may take certain actions in relation to that default  including  but not limited to  requiring us to repay the entire outstanding balance under the credit facility 
term loan from landlord in may  we borrowed  from the landlord of our leased facilities in horsham  pennsylvania 
the terms of the financing require us to pay monthly principal and interest payments over months at an interest rate of 
as of december   we owed the landlord  during  we expect to make principal and interest payments totaling  under this agreement 
equipment loans we borrowed   and  during   and  respectively  from an equipment lender to finance the purchase of equipment and facility improvements  which collateralize the amounts borrowed 
the terms of the financings require us to make monthly principal and interest payments through january at interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   we owed the equipment lender  during  we will be required to make principal and interest payments totaling  under these agreements 
as discussed in restructuring above  we have commenced efforts to dispose of our current headquarters and pilot manufacturing facility witmer road facility 
if we dispose of the witmer road facility  we will be required to repay some of the outstanding balance to the equipment lender 
capital lease obligations we did not enter into any agreements with capital lease obligations during we entered into agreements with capital lease obligations during and for equipment with a value of  and  respectively 
the terms of existing leases require us to make monthly payments through august as of december   the present value of aggregate minimum lease payments under these agreements was  under these agreements  we will be required to make principal and interest payments totaling  during operating leases we lease laboratory  office  warehouse facilities  and equipment under operating lease agreements 
in april  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in san diego  california 
as part of the restructuring announced in august and described in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k  we centralized research activities in horsham  pennsylvania by ending operations in our leased facility in san diego  california 
as of october   we ceased operations at our san diego facility 
the initial term of the san diego lease ends on march   at which time we intend to terminate the lease 
we lease approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in horsham  pennsylvania under a lease agreement that expires april in february  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in another nearby building in horsham  pennsylvania 
the initial term of the lease ends in july  at which time we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years  followed by another option to extend the lease for an additional four and one half years 
our laboratory  office  and warehouse facility leases contain escalation clauses  under which the base rent increases annually by 
our rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years after years long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital lease obligations debt maturities contractual interest operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations see financing activities debt financing activities in this liquidity and capital resources section and note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this form k for a description of the material features of our long term debt

represents the remaining payments as of december  under separation and retirement agreements with former officers of the company 
these agreements are described in note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this form k 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a focuses on our liquidity  capital resources  and financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed and adjusted periodically by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements included in item of this form k 
management considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a 
accounting for restructuring costs to account for exit or disposal activities  such as the restructuring described in overview in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k  we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
it does not apply to costs associated with a disposal activity covered by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

the restructuring charges recorded by us during the six months ended december  were comprised primarily of costs to reduce property and equipment to fair value and to reduce our workforce 
our net loss for the year ended december  included  of charges related to this restructuring  including  of non cash property and equipment impairment charges and  of payments for employee severance and facility closure costs 
under sfas no 
 any impairment of property and equipment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
to determine the fair value of assets that are not likely to be used over their remaining useful economic life  we use a probability weighted approach of estimated cash flows to be received upon a range of possible disposition outcomes 
in august  we announced we would evaluate alternatives for our current headquarters and pilot manufacturing facility witmer road facility  which we own subject to a mortgage  including the potential disposition of the facility and further consolidation of our research  development and administrative operations into a currently leased facility that is also located in horsham  pennsylvania 
following the announcement  we concluded that identifiable cash flows could be assigned to the witmer road facility and related equipment 
we based our estimates of potential cash flows related to possible disposition outcomes on conversations with commercial real estate firms that have both knowledge of recent history of sales and expertise in marketing and selling similar facilities 
these estimates may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cash flows may be materially different from our estimates 
our estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans 
we periodically evaluate current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary 
revenue recognition our revenue from collaborative agreements consists of upfront fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments 
we recognize revenues consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab was issued by the securities and exchange commission in december upfront fees and payments received from non substantive milestones  such as the passage of time  are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but the actual performance period may vary 
we adjust the performance periods based on available facts and circumstances 
periodic payments received for research and development activities are recognized over the period that we perform those activities under the terms of each agreement 
revenue resulting from the achievement of substantive milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based on the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
stock based employee compensation we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for all stock based employee compensation 
we record deferred compensation for option grants to employees for the amount  if any  by which the market price per share exceeds the exercise price per share 
we amortize deferred compensation over the vesting periods of each option 
we have elected to adopt only the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method was calculated as of the date of grant of individual awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the volatility and expected term assumptions have the most significant effect on the results obtained from the black scholes option pricing model 
the volatility assumption for each year has been estimated with reference to our historical volatility 
the expected term assumption for each award has been estimated with reference to prior option exercise history  as well as the simplified method outlined by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
the following table contains the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model in each year to value stock based compensation year ended december  expected life years stock options employee stock purchase plan n a risk free interest rate stock options employee stock purchase plan n a volatility dividend yield impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist  such as our august restructuring described in overview in the liquidity and capital resources section of this form k 
because our history of negative operating cash flows is an indicator of impairment  we annually compare the market value of our equity and debt to the carrying value of our net assets 
the market value of our equity and debt exceeded the carrying value of our net assets as of december  and  therefore  we did not record any impairment of long lived assets beyond the impairment recorded in connection with our august restructuring 
estimating expenses from contract research and development service providers some of our research and development is conducted by third parties  including contract research and development service providers 
at the end of each quarter  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated service provided  we record prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs 
we monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjust estimates accordingly 
results of operations years ended december  and and outlook for our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to and provides our estimate of trends for for each component 
revenue from collaborative agreements 
our revenues from collaborative agreements have historically been derived from a few major collaborators 
our collaborative agreements provide for some or all of the following elements upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone revenues  and royalties on product sales 
revenue from collaborative agreements increased to  in from  in due to research and development funding under our collaborations with novo nordisk and biogenerix 
during the years ended december    and  one customer accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenues 
another customer accounted for and of our total revenues during the years ended december  and respectively 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 
material cash inflows from proprietary drug development projects are highly uncertain  and we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive  if ever  material net cash inflows from our major research and development projects 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including entering into collaborative agreements  the achievement of certain milestones  and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by the levels of effort committed and made by our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may discontinue development  may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  or they may not successfully market potential products 
research and development expense 
our proprietary drug development portfolio consists of two therapeutic protein candidates glycopeg epo ne and glycopeg gcsf 
erythropoietin epo is prescribed to stimulate production of red blood cells  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia and anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
based on early preclinical studies  we believe it is feasible to develop a long acting epo through glycopegylation 
in february  we initiated a phase i clinical trial for ne in a western european country 
we expect this clinical trial to conclude by mid in the us  our investigational new drug application ind for ne is currently on clinical hold with the us food and drug administration fda 
we anticipate finalizing our complete response to the fda in early the timing of submission of this response to the fda will depend upon the evolution of our regulatory and clinical strategy 
the early clinical development of ne could be carried out entirely in europe 
granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf is prescribed to stimulate production of neutrophils a type of white blood cell  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of neutropenia associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
based on our proof of concept data and preclinical development activities  we believe it is feasible to develop a long acting g csf through glycopegylation 
we expect that by the end of the first quarter of  in collaboration with our partner  biogenerix  we will commence the regulatory process in a european country 
we conduct exploratory research  both independently and with collaborators  on therapeutic candidates  primarily proteins  for development using our enzymatic technologies 
successful candidates may be advanced for development through our own proprietary drug program or through our partnering and licensing program  or a combination of the two 
although our primary focus is the development of long acting proteins  we are also conducting research to assess opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in other areas  such as glycopeptides and glycolipids 
we expect to continue this research during our current research and development projects are divided between two categories i glycoadvance and glycopegylation and ii other glycotechnology programs  which includes projects investigating opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in other areas  such as glycolipids 
the following chart sets forth our projects in each of these categories and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status glycoadvance and glycopegylation improved erythropoietin clinical phase i active improved granulocyte colony stimulating factor preclinical active other protein projects research active other glycotechnology programs non protein therapeutic applications research active nutritional applications n a evaluating outlicensing opportunities the process of bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase i  phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials to fda or other regulatory approval is time consuming and expensive 
because our announced product candidates are currently in the early clinical and preclinical stages  and there are a variety of potential intermediate clinical and non clinical outcomes that are inherent in drug development  we cannot reasonably estimate either the timing or costs we will incur to complete these research and development projects 
in addition  the timing and costs to complete our research and development projects will be affected by the timing and nature of any collaboration agreements we may enter into with a third party  neither of which we can currently estimate 
for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials  and supplies for each project 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and preclinical development costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property  and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 
our research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in during  excluding the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  we expect our research and development expenses to be lower than they were in as a result of the restructuring we implemented in august the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands year ended december  glycoadvance and glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses glycoadvance and glycopegylation our glycoadvance and glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased preclinical development costs associated with ne and glycopeg gcsf  and increased purchases of laboratory services and research supplies 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased research during to assess opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in glycolipids 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses decreased during  compared to  primarily due to decreased depreciation resulting from the august impairment of our san diego and witmer road facilities and their related assets 
further contributing to the decrease during were lower amounts spent for indirect outside laboratory services and consulting 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the corresponding period in the decrease in was attributable to lower salaries and personnel related expenses  lower consulting costs  and reduced depreciation  which resulted from the august impairment of our san diego and witmer road facilities and their related assets 
partially offsetting these decreases were an increase in patent legal expenses as well as higher non cash compensation expenses due to the issuance of restricted stock units 
during  excluding the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent with the expense amounts 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges for the year ended december  were  which included  of non cash property and equipment impairment charges and  of expected payments for employee severance and facility closure costs 
we did not incur any restructuring charges during interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the increase was due to higher interest rates during our interest income during is difficult to project  and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates and whether we enter into any new collaborative agreements and complete any equity or debt financings during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in  primarily due to higher interest rates during the increase was also partially attributable to the fact that we did not capitalize any interest expense during during  we capitalized  of interest expense associated with leasehold improvements that we placed in service in april our interest expense during is difficult to project and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates  whether we repay debt in connection with any sale of the witmer road facility  and whether we complete any new debt financings

years ended december  and our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to revenue from collaborative agreements 
revenue from collaborative agreements increased to  in from  in  primarily due to research and development funding under our collaborations with novo nordisk and biogenerix 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands 
year ended december  glycoadvance and glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses glycoadvance and glycopegylation our glycoadvance and glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased preclinical development costs associated with ne and glycopeg gcsf  purchases of laboratory services and research supplies  including proteins  and the reallocation of resources from our other glycotechnology programs 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs decreased during  compared to  consistent with our focus on our glycoadvance and glycopegylation programs 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increases related to depreciation of the leasehold improvements at a facility that we occupied in april  as well as the costs associated with operating this facility 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the corresponding period in the period contained higher patent legal expenses than the comparable period

during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  relating to our investment in series a convertible preferred stock of neuronyx  inc we recorded the equity investment  which was made in  at cost 
in october  neuronyx informed us they were nearing completion of a series c equity financing  under which series c and series b neuronyx investors would have an aggregate liquidation preference that would have been senior to the series a liquidation preference and exceeded the assumed post money valuation of neuronyx 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment to zero as of september  by recording the non cash impairment charge 
we did not record any impairment charges during interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in the increase was due to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances  as well as slightly higher interest rates  during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the corresponding period in  primarily due to higher average debt outstanding during the increase was partly offset by the capitalization of more interest expense during than during and  we capitalized  and  respectively  of interest expense associated with leasehold improvements which we placed in service in april recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
 which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made by us in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of sfas no 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we adopted the provisions of fin on december  no conditional asset retirement obligations were recognized and  accordingly  the adoption of fin had no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule permitting issuers to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after june  the statement requires us to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and to record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  we have the choice of adopting sfas no 
r using either a the modified prospective method  or b the modified retrospective method 
beginning january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method whereby compensation cost will be recognized for new awards granted and awards modified  repurchased  and cancelled after january   and for the unvested portion of all awards issued prior to and outstanding at january  at their respective grant date fair values as the remaining requisite service is rendered 
based on the awards outstanding at february   we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in approximately  to  of increased compensation expense during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the preceding estimate assumes an equal number of shares issuable pursuant to options granted during as compared to  and assumes the exercise price for options granted during march through december of equals the average exercise price for all options granted during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we are currently not engaged in hedging activities and we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
we do not believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is material to our results of operations 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of our interest income and expense to selected changes in market interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations and maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we seek the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in high credit quality institutional money market funds and fixed income securities 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
because our investments are short term in duration  we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant 
we held no marketable securities as of december  the approximate principal amount of our investment portfolio as of december  was  and the weighted average interest rate and interest income earned on the portfolio during were and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis as it relates to our investment activities assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their weighted average levels in a basis point move up or down in market interest rates would have caused a corresponding change of  in interest income for as of december   the principal components of our debt portfolio were a term loan from a bank for  that accrues interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus  tax exempt industrial development authority bond of  that accrues interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus  a term loan from our landlord of  that accrues interest at a fixed rate of  aggregate equipment financing of  that accrues interest at fixed rates ranging from to and capital lease obligations with a present value of  for which we imputed interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
our aggregate interest expense for was  by modifying the interest expense associated with our variable rate debt  and fixed rate debt entered into during  a basis point move up or down in market interest rates would have caused a corresponding change of  in interest expense for foreign exchange risk we have entered into some agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in euros or other foreign currencies  and  in the future  we may enter into additional  significant agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
if the values of these currencies increase against the dollar  our costs would increase 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results
