item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview during the past five years  the company has experienced net losses 
these losses  which are partially the result of lower sales volumes related to market declines in the rv industry have negatively impacted the company s liquidity 
in response to these conditions  the company has implemented initiatives to increase sales volumes through new product and floorplan introductions and the addition of new dealers  to re balance head counts to current retail sales supported production levels  to improve manufacturing efficiencies  and to further reduce manufacturing and other overhead costs 
for the year ended december  the company had a net loss of million or per share  compared to its net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  at december   the company established a full valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax asset and recorded the corresponding non cash charge in its december  financial results 
the company s full valuation allowance increased by million  to million  during the year ended december  as a result of the full tax valuation allowance established for the years ended december  and  the financial results do not include an income tax benefit 
in response to the weakness in the class a market and an industry wide build up in inventory levels  the company changed its overall strategy to a retail pull strategy and set its production rates at or below retail demand 
this allowed the company to reduce excess work in process and finished goods inventory to acceptable levels by the end of the year 
however  this effort was costly as the gross margin percentage declined by  to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the lower gross margins for the year ended december  were caused by higher sales incentives resulting from the weakening class a market  increased spending on engineering and product development  higher material handling costs  higher mid year manufacturing costs as the company s work in process inventories increased  multiple weeks of shutdowns  and finally  higher warranty costs driven by higher rates and costs of settlement of claims on older highline coaches

operating performance during  the rv industry experienced an decline in wholesale shipments while the company experienced a decline of only 
despite the improved shipments compared to the rv industry as a whole  the results of the company were significantly impacted by the industry wide slump in demand for class a motorhomes 
a build up in finished goods inventory at the company  and within the industry  led to significant discounting to reduce the excess inventories 
additionally  the company experienced production inefficiencies at its california operations driven by challenges with new model introductions  commodity flow difficulties  the work down of excess work in process inventory  and with lower production rates leading to lower fixed cost absorption 
other factors leading to the decline in operating performance include higher warranty costs related to large warranty claim settlements on older units at the company s highline division  significant investments in product development and the high cost of ongoing compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
looking ahead many of the same objectives the company addressed last year remain in place for the current year  including aggressive product development  cost containment  and increased customer satisfaction

the recreation vehicle industry association s rvia market expansion campaign  go rving  now in its eighth year  is fostering greater awareness and garnering media attention 
though rvia expects substantial growth for the industry in the long term or decade ahead  rvia expects a continued decline in the industry during this analysis of the company s financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company has performed an evaluation of its ability to continue as a going concern and believes it has sufficient financial resources to fund its operations through at least march accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of the assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are i the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and ii that require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and maintains a reserve for excess and obsolescence to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market or to amounts on hand to meet expected demand in the near term 
specifically  service and slow moving parts not being used in the manufacture of current model year motorhomes are reviewed by the company to determine which can be used in production  which can be used for future service and warranty repairs of customer owned motorhomes  and which can be returned to suppliers for full or partial credit 
in addition  finished good motorhomes are evaluated by the company and the value of those motorhomes is adjusted to an estimated market value based on a combination of the national automobile dealers association guide and the company s general industry knowledge 
the inventory reserves are reviewed each fiscal quarter and revisions are made as necessary 
unfavorable changes in obsolete inventory estimates would result in an increase in the inventory reserve and a decrease in gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets effective the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company assesses the fair value and recoverability of its long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  the company makes assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors 
the fair value of the long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of the company s business and the overall economic environment 
when the company determines that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  it measures impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
the following table provides the estimated useful lives used for each asset type land improvements years buildings and building improvements years machinery and equipment years office equipment years leasehold improvements  which are included in buildings and building improvements  made at the inception or during the term of the lease and assets under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased or when the capital lease is entered into 
warranty reserve the company s warranty reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company records an estimate for future warranty related costs based on recent actual warranty claims and historical experience 
also  the company s recall reserve is established  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the cost per unit to remedy a recall problem and the estimated number of units that will ultimately be brought in for the repair 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty costs that it has in the past 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
workers compensation self insurance reserve the company s workers compensation reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing employee workers compensation claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the company records a reserve estimate for future workers compensation related costs based on the company s historical workers compensation claims paid history using an actuarial incurred but not reported ibnr approach 
the company cannot provide assurance that these costs will continue at these levels  increase or decrease  in the near term 
a significant change in california workers compensation legislation  the cost of claims or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
legal proceedings the company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  including a variety of warranty  lemon law and product liability claims typical in the recreation vehicle industry 
with respect to product liability claims  the company s insurance policies cover  in whole or in part  defense costs and liability costs for personal injury or property damage excluding damage to company motorhomes 
while it is impossible to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to this litigation  management is of the opinion that while the final resolution of any such litigation may have an impact on the company s consolidated results for a particular reporting period  the ultimate disposition of such litigation will not have any material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer  iii the price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales incentives as is common throughout the rv industry  the company offers incentives to its dealers in the form of discounts and floorplan interest reimbursement programs  rebate and holdback programs  and retail sales incentives given to its dealers retail salespersons 
the company recognizes and records the costs of these incentives in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
discounts and floorplan interest reimbursement programs are offered to dealers on purchases of certain units 
the company recognizes the cost of discounts and floorplan interest reimbursement as a reduction of revenue and records the cost of these programs at the later of the offer or when the associated revenue is recognized 
rebate and holdback programs involve payments by the company to the dealer based on either a percentage of the net invoice price or a predetermined amount based on the model of the coach sold by the dealer 
the dealer incentive program varies by dealer 
not all dealers participate 
the purpose of the program is to provide an additional incentive to the dealer to promote sales of the product 
the dealers earn the incentive upon the wholesale purchase of the unit from the company 
the company recognizes these incentives as a reduction of revenue and records the cost of these incentives when the associated revenue is recognized 
the company often pays retail sales incentives directly to dealer retail salespersons to promote the sale of the product and the return of sale and warranty information 
this information assists in providing sales and marketing data to the company 
the company recognizes the cost of such retail sales incentives as a reduction of revenue and records the cost of such retail sales incentives when the associated revenue is recognized 
cooperative advertising arrangements exist through which dealers receive a certain allowance of the total purchases from the company if certain qualitative advertising criteria are met and if specified amounts are spent on the advertisements 
a dealer must maintain documentation of all advertising performed that includes the company s products and provide that documentation to the company upon request 
because the company receives an identifiable advertising benefit from the dealer  the company recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising as a selling expense and records the cost of cooperative advertising when the units are sold to the dealers 
the company uses a non monetary incentive program that rewards rv dealer personnel by performance 
instead of cash  rewards are offered at tiered levels  based on the number of the company s products by each dealership participant 
rewards include items such as home electronics  exercise equipment  personal data assistants  trips  and so on 
the more a salesperson sells  the more they are eligible to redeem items at the various reward levels set for the program 
the company accrues the estimated costs of the non monetary loyalty program upon retail sale of a unit in selling expenses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company estimates its income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company is required to assess the likelihood that its net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that its recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  the company is required to take into account all positive and negative evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset  including the company s past earnings history  market conditions  management profitability forecasts  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a net deferred tax asset 
sfas no 
further states that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
in situations involving tax related uncertainties  the company provides for tax liabilities when it determines it is probable and estimable that additional taxes may be due 
as additional information becomes available  or these uncertainties are resolved with the taxing authorities  revisions to these liabilities may be required  resulting in additional provision for or benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such determination is made

further states that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
recent cumulative losses  the downturn in current market conditions and its impact on near term earnings outweighed other factors including the long carryforward periods and led the company to conclude that it was more likely than not that its recorded net deferred tax assets will not be realized resulting in the full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset as of december  as a result  the company has recorded a non cash charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance against its december  net deferred tax asset

the company provided cash from operating activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and used cash from operating activities of million for the year ended december  the rv industry has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions 
with eroding consumer confidence and continued economic uncertainty  the company experienced a continuation of losses during the year ended december  these conditions led the company to assess its short term liquidity needs and plans to achieve profitability 
during the year ended december   the company financed its operations primarily through its existing working capital and its line of credit with ups capital corporation and wells fargo bank

for the year ended december   the company used million of cash in investing activities  which were primarily capital expenditures of million 
for the year ended december   the company provided million of cash from financing activities  which were primarily due to an increase in the book overdraft of million  partially offset by repayments on the line of credit of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  mainly due to the advances on the line of credit totaling million  an increase in book overdraft of million and million in proceeds from issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options

at january   the company had an asset based revolving credit facility of million with upsc  which was scheduled to expire in august on august   the original facility was replaced by a new three year asset based revolving credit facility with upsc and wells fargo bank for million  with the company having the option  subject to certain conditions  of increasing the revolver in million increments up to a total credit facility of million 
on september   the company affected such an increase in the amount of the credit facility from million to million 
the new credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s assets other than real estate 
borrowing availability is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the facility also includes a requirement to maintain a blocked account arrangement  whereby remittances from the company s customers reduce the debt outstanding 
the new credit facility contains  among other provisions  certain financial covenants  including funded debt to ebitda  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
if these financial covenants are not met  the company s availability under the credit facility will be reduced 
the company did not meet these financial covenants as of year end and currently does not expect to meet them until the fourth quarter of until these covenants are met  the company s average monthly borrowing availability under its million facility will be limited to an amount between million and million  depending on eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
initial amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate listed in the wall street journal plus percentage points and may be subsequently adjusted down based on a trailing twelve month funded debt to ebitda calculation 
at december  the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit was 
the weighted average interest rate for the borrowings under the line of credit during the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
management s plan to achieve operational profitability includes continuing or starting a variety of initiatives to improve its earnings and working capital position  including i new product and floor plan introductions in  ii new dealer additions to fill open market areas or replace under performing dealers  iii decrease overall sales incentives by tailoring programs that provide the maximum value to the company  iv reduce material and related obsolescence costs  v improve manufacturing efficiencies  vi further reduce manufacturing and other overhead costs  and vii decrease the costs of warranty 
in order to fund on going operations through at least march   the company remains dependent upon its ability to utilize outside financing through borrowings on its line of credit until it achieves sustained operational profitability through a combination of increased sales  cost reductions and improved product margins 
after consideration of the restrictions of the borrowing capacity noted above  the company believes it has sufficient financial resources to fund its operations through at least march  however  the company s ability to meet its obligations beyond march is dependent on its ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and is dependent on continued borrowings under its line of credit 
if management is unable to achieve its operational profitability plan or unforeseen events occur and its existing line of credit is insufficient to allow the company to meet its obligations  the company may need to implement alternative plans that could include long term financing collateralized by real estate which is presently unencumbered or obtaining additional debt financing  additional reductions in operating costs  deferral of capital expenditures  and further reductions in working capital 
while the company believes that it could successfully complete the alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that the company would be successful in its implementation of such plans 
contractual obligations the following is a schedule at december  of the company s known contractual obligations in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases capital leases in thousands less than after commercial commitments total year years years years revolving credit facility letter of credit wells fargo other commitments most of the company s motorhome sales are made on terms requiring payment within business days or less of the dealer s receipt of the unit 
most dealers finance all  or substantially all  of the purchase price of their inventory under floor plan arrangements with banks or finance companies under which the lender pays the company directly 
dealers typically are not required to commence loan repayments to such lenders for a period of at least six months 
the loan is collateralized by a lien on the motorhome 
consistent with industry practice  the company has entered into repurchase agreements with these lenders 
in general  the repurchase agreements require the company to repurchase a unit if the dealer defaults on the financed unit 
upon a dealer default  the agreements generally require the company to repurchase rvs at the election of the lender provided certain conditions are met  such as repossession of the rv by the lender  the rv being new and unused and the time elapsed between invoice date and demand for repurchase being no longer than a specified period which is typically months or less 
the company s undiscounted maximum potential exposure under these agreements approximated million at december  as with receivables  the risk of loss under the repurchase agreements was spread over a number of dealers and lenders and was reduced by the resale value of the rvs  which the company would be required to repurchase 
losses under these agreements have not been material in the past and management does not believe that any future losses under such agreements will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
consequently  no liability has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements
