restatement and internal control remediation matters during the preparation of the company s tax returns in the fourth quarter  the company became aware that certain intercompany interest income was subject to us withholding tax when the interest was paid and certain income from its puerto rico operations could be treated as income of acpt even though it was not distributed to acpt 
to correct the errors discovered  the company restated its financial statements for the periods covered in its form k for the fiscal year ended december  and its forms q for the first two quarters of fiscal the company has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over accounting for income taxes as of december   and has determined that the accounting errors referenced above and the potential for additional misstatements indicate a material weakness in internal control over accounting for income taxes 
the company is taking steps to ensure that the material weakness is remediated  including the retentio n of additional international tax advisors and providing our in house tax professionals and senior financial management with additional training to enhance their awareness of potential international tax matters and enable the company to more effectively manage its internal and third party tax professionals 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which we refer to as gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies  which we consider criti cal in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters  which are inherently uncertain 
sales  profit recognition and cost capitalization community development land sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained  possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer  and acpt has no significant continuing involvement 
under the provisions of sfas  related to condominium sales  revenues and costs are recognized when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non delivery of the unit  sufficient units in the project have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales proceeds are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the project can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly we recognize revenue and costs upon settlement with the homebuyer which doesn t occur until after we receive use and occupancy permits for the building 
the costs of acquiring and developing land are allocated to our land assets and charged to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
the costs of acquiring the land and construction of the condominiums are allocated to these assets and charged to cost of sales as the condominiums are sold 
the cost of sales is determined by the relative sales value method  which relies on estimated costs and sales values 
residential and commercial land sales can be highly cyclical 
once development is undertaken  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to sell the various developed lots or condominiums in a timely manner 
failure to sell such lots and homes in a timely manner could result in significantly increased carrying costs and erosion or elimination of profit with respect to any development 
even though our cost estimates are based on outside engineers cost estimates  construction contracts and historical costs  our actual development and construction costs can exceed estimates for various reasons  including but not limited to unknown site conditions  rising prices and changes in government regulations 
any estimates of such costs may differ substantially from the actual results of such costs and reduce or eliminate the future profits with respect to any development 
the portion of interest allocated to land during the development and construction period is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
remaining interest costs are expensed 
the interest incurred on the land acquisition and construction loan is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
investment in unconsolidated real estate entities the company accounts for investments in unconsolidated real estate entities that are not considered variable interest entities under fin in accordance with sop accounting for investments in real estate ventures and apb opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the company s investments in unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting consisted of general partnership interests in limited partnerships which own apartment properties in the united states and puerto rico  a limited partnership interest in two limited partnerships that own commercial properties in puerto rico  and a ownership interest in a limited liability company 
the company considers many factors in determining whether or not an investment should be recorded under the equity method  such as economic and ownership interests  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners 
income and losses are recognized in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements and any guarantee obligations or commitments for financial support 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  or eitf eitf provides an accounting model to be used by a general partner  or group of general partners  to determine whether the general partner s controls a limited partnership or similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited partners and provides additional guidance on what constitutes substantive kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
we have determined that new guidance provided by eitf  which is effective january   requires the company to consolidate all its apartment partnerships for which it serves as the general partner except for brookside gardens limited partnership and lakeside apartments limited partnership 
the impact of consolidating the previously unconsolidated partners hips will materially impact the presentation of the company s assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
refer to note in item of this report for additional disclosures regarding the impact on the company s financial statement presentation 
impairment of long lived assets acpt carries its rental properties  homebuilding inventory  land and development costs at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our real estate assets are considered long lived assets under us gaap  we are required to evaluate whether the carrying amount of each of these assets will be recovered from their undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if the carrying value were to be greater than the undiscounted future operating cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount is not recoverable 
our estimates of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties  including  among others  demand for apartment units  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
up on determination that an impairment has occurred  the company records an impairment charge equal to the excess of the historical cost over fair value 
depreciation of investments in real estate we are required to make assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on our income statement on an annual basis 
our assessments  all of which are judgmental determinations  of our investments in our real estate assets are as follows buildings and improvements are depreciated over five to forty years using the straight line or double declining balance methods  furniture  fixtures and equipment over five to seven years using the straight line method leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the life of the lease or their estimated useful life  maintenance and other repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
income taxes the company s complex tax structure involves foreign source income and multiple entities that file separate returns 
due to the complex nature of tax regulations affecting our entities  our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
if it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is expensed in the financial statements 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  we rely on the advice of our outside counsel as to the potential and probable outcome of these proceedings when evaluating any financial statement impact 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of sec regulation s k item a 
results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares the components of the results of operations by segment for each of the three years ended december   and historically  the company s financial results have been affected by the cyclical nature of the real estate industry and timing of the delivery of fully developed residential lots and commercial acres 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future results 
this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations us operations for the year ended december   our us segment generated  of operating income compared to  of operating income generated by the segment for the same period in and  in please review the discussion below for an analysis of our operating results 
community development us operations land sales revenue in any one period is affected by the mix of lot sizes and  to a greater extent  the mix between residential and commercial sales 
in march  the company executed an agreement with lennar corporation to sell  residential lots  single family lots and town home lots in fairway village 
the agreement requires the homebuilder to provide  in letters of credit to secure the purchase of the lots 
lennar has agreed to purchase residential lots per year  provided that they are developed and available for delivery 
based on lot sales per year  it is estimated that lot settlements will take place through sales are closed on a lot by lot basis at the time when the builder purchases the lot 
the ultimate selling price per lot sold to lennar may exceed the amount recognized at closing since the final lot price is equal to of the base price of the home sold on the lot 
additional revenue exceeding the initial price per lot will be recognized upon lennar s settlement with the respective homebuyers 
residential lots can vary in size and location resulting in pricing differences 
gross margins of residential lots are fairly consistent within any given village in st 
charles 
commercial land is typically sold by contract that allows for a study period and delayed settlement until the purchaser obtains the necessary permits for development 
the sales prices and gross margins for commercial parcels vary significantly depending on the location  size  extent of development and ultimate use 
commercial land sales are cyclical and usually have a noticeable positive effect on our earnings in the period they reach settlement 
compared to community development land sales revenue increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in the increase in our community development land sales revenue in is the result of major residential development and delivery of residential lots to lennar 
residential land sales in  we delivered lots to lennar at an average selling price of  per lot  the price includes the initial selling price of  per lot plus water and sewer fees  road fees and other off site fees 
in we sold standard single family residential lots for an average initial selling price of  per lot 
in  we also recognized for the first time  additional revenue of  based on the final settlement of homes of lots previously sold to lennar in and prices for our residential lots reflect the healthy housing market in and its upward trend in home prices in charles county 
the current selling price of town homes in this area is in excess of  while single family homes in fairway village are selling in excess of  as of december   we had developed residential lots available for delivery 
commercial land sales in  we sold acres of commercial land for per square foot compared to acres of commercial land for sales prices for per square foot for the same period in the average sales prices of these parcels differ due to their location  use and level of development 
as of december   our backlog contained acres of commercial acres under contract for a total of  st 
charles active adult community  llc land joint venture in september  the company transferred a parcel of land in the glen eagles neighborhood in fairway village with a cost basis of  to a newly formed joint venture with lennar in exchange for cash of  and a membership interest in the venture 
pursuant to an operating agreement  the joint venture will develop the property and sell it to the homebuilding company 
the company serves as the managing agent for the project and receives a management fee 
the company recorded deferred revenues equal to the cash it received at closing and off site fees the joint venture is obligated to pay the company until the lots are sold by the joint venture to the homebuilder 
the company recorded deferred costs related to of the cost basis of the land 
we expect minimal profit from the activities of the joint venture 
however  we expect to recognize the profit on the portion of land transferred as lots are sold by lennar through the amortization of previously deferred revenues and costs 
pursuant to the terms of the lot option agreement  lots began selling in the fourth quarter of and are expected to continue through the first quarter of the company recorded the remaining of the land s cost basis as investment in the joint venture within our community development assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the joint venture sold its first lots to lennar 
as a result  the company recognized  for fees   of deferred revenue and  of deferred costs 
the joint venture did not sell any lots to lennar in gross margin on land sales the gross margin on land sales for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period of our gross margins on land sales in and have been affected by increases in the price of steel  oil and fuel and the strong demand and limited supply for contractors for the development of lots in fairway village 
these cost increases were more than offset by increased sales prices of homes in fairway village 
customer dependence our community development land sales revenue from lennar in was  which accounts for of the company s total revenue and of the us segment s revenue 
loss of all or a substantial portion of our land sales  as well as the joint venture s land sales  to lennar would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results until such lost sales could be replaced 
compared to community development land sales revenue increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in residential land sales in  we sold standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  per lot compared to standard size single family lots which sold for an average sales price of  during the same period of the average selling price of the standard single family lot increased in compared to due to the fact that residential lots sold in were negotiated with homebuilders in and during a relatively flat housing market 
prices for our current residential lots reflect the healthy housing market and its upward trend in home prices 
the current selling price of town homes in this area is approximately  while single family homes in fairway village are selling in excess of  as of december   we did not have any developed residential lots available for delivery 
commercial land sales in  we sold acres of commercial land for per square foot compared to acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot for the same period in the average sales prices of these parcels differ due to their location  use and level of development 
as of december   our backlog contained of commercial acres under contract for a total of  gross margin on land sales the gross margin on land sales for the year ended december  increased to compared to for the same period of although the selling price of our residential lots increased in as compared to  our gross margin on land sales was affected by increases in the costs for the development of lots in fairway village 
our development costs have been directly affected by the increase in the price of steel  oil and fuel and the strong demand and limited supply for contractors 
rental property revenues and operating results us operations certain of the us based apartment properties in which we hold an ownership interest qualify for the consolidation method of accounting 
as a result  we include within our financial statements the consolidated apartment properties total revenue and operating expenses 
the portion of net income attributable to the interests of the outside owners of some of these properties and any losses and distributions in excess of the minority owners basis in those properties are reflected as minority interest 
as of december   nine of the consolidated properties are market rent properties  allowing us to determine the appropriate rental rates 
even though we can determine the rents  a portion of our units at some of the properties must be leased to tenants with low to moderate income 
hud subsidizes one of the properties and the three remaining properties are a mix of subsidized units and market rent units 
hud dictates the rents of the subsidized units 
apartment acquisitions on october   the company acquired the assets of two apartment properties  owings chase llc and prescott square llc  located in pikesville  maryland

the company will evaluate and determine on a continuing basis  depending upon market conditions and the outcome of events described under the section titled forward looking statements  the most efficient use of the company s capital  including acquisitions and dispositions  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging or retiring certain of the company s outstanding debt obligations or repurchasing shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions  open market transactions or by other direct or indirect means to the extent permitted by law and its existing contractual obligations debt guarantees and other obligations acpt and its subsidiaries typically provide guarantees for another subsidiary s loan or letters of credit 
in many cases more than one company guarantees the same debt 
all of these companies are consolidated and the debt or other financial commitment is included in acpt s consolidated financial statements 
these guarantees should not impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has been moderate in recent years 
in general  we attempt to minimize any inflationary effect by increasing our market rents  land prices and home prices 
however  in recent history  the increases in the hud subsidies have not offset the increase in the costs to insure  operate and maintain the properties  resulting in a negative impact on our cash flow 
intercompany dividend restrictions certain of our debt and regulatory agreements require us to abide by covenants which  among other things  limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions 
the regulatory agreements governing the apartment properties limit the dividend to annual or semi annual distributions of no more than surplus cash 
in addition  the distributions of the apartment properties are limited to a specified annual cumulative rate of return ranging from to 
lender approval is required prior to lda or torres making any cash distributions in excess of distributions to pay income taxes on lda s and torres generated taxable income  unless certain conditions exist that provide for adequate working capital for debt service and operations for the following twelve months 
these restrictions are not expected to impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
insurance and risk of uninsured loss we carry various lines of insurance coverage for all of our investment properties  including property insurance and believe that we are adequately covered against normal risks 
these policies  and other insurance policies we carry  have policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable 
we renewed our insurance coverage on may  for our puerto rico operations and october  for our us operations for one year policy terms 
although the insurance coverage provided for in the renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year  our premium costs increased overall by as compared to the prior policy year 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures  and the need to remediate such mold  is not a new phenomenon  there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects  including allergic or other reactions 
to help limit mold growth  we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture 
we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present 
however  we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner 
if a sig nificant mold problem arises at one of our properties  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 
we cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our apartment properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the use of financial instruments  such as debt instruments  subjects our company to market risks  which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets 
market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices 
we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
it is the company s policy to minimize the impact of variable rate debt to the greatest extent possible by pursuing equity and long term fixed rate financing and refinancings of current fixed rate debt at lower rates when favorable market conditions exist 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents the company s debt obligations  principal repayments  and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair values 
the company has no derivative financial instruments 
we believe that the change in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be immaterial to our total assets and total liabilities 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate in thousands fair value december  thereafter total long term debt  including current portions fixed rate debt principal fixed rate debt interest average interest rate variable rate debt principal variable rate debt interest average interest rate
