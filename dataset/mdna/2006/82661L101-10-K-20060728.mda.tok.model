these statements speak as of the date of this report and the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements in light of future events or otherwise 
overview the company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of ems  which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products 
in connection with the production of assembled products  the company also provides services to its customers  including automatic and manual assembly and testing of products  material sourcing and procurement  design  manufacturing and test engineering support  warehousing and shipment services  and assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies 
the company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the north america  china and taiwan 
as the demand for electronic products has continued to increase over the past several months  the lead time for many components has increased 
pricing for some components and related commodities has escalated due to the increased demand and the transition to rohs components and may continue to increase in the future periods 
the impact of these price increases could have a negative effect on the company s gross margins and operating results 
the company relies on numerous third party suppliers for components used in the company s production process 
certain of these components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  a customer s specifications may require the company to obtain components from a single source or a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  and the company may be required to operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers 
the company does not enter into purchase agreements with major or single source suppliers 
the company believes that ad hoc negotiations with its suppliers provides flexibility  given that the company s orders are based on the needs of its customers  which constantly change 
the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and new listing requirements subsequently adopted by nasdaq in response to sarbanes oxley  have required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these new rules  regulations  and requirements have increased the company s legal expenses  financial compliance and administrative costs  made many other activities more time consuming and costly and diverted the attention of senior management 
these new rules and regulations have also made it more difficult for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
in addition  if the company receives a qualified opinion on the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting  shareholders could lose confidence in the reliability of the company s financial statements  which could have a material adverse impact on the value of the company s stock 
sales can be a misleading indicator of the company s financial performance 
sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services consignment and turnkey rendered by the company and the demand by customers 
consignment orders require the company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer  and the company charges only for its labor  overhead and manufacturing costs  plus a profit 
in the case of turnkey orders  the company provides  in addition to manufacturing services  the components and other materials used in assembly 
turnkey contracts  in general  have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly  owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold 
variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the company s revenue levels 
however  the company does not believe that such variations are a meaningful indicator of the company s gross margins 
consignment orders accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the year ended april  in the past  the timing and rescheduling of orders have caused the company to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and earnings  and the company expects such fluctuations to continue 
critical accounting policies management estimates and uncertainties the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods  the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves for inventory and valuation of goodwill 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of product including the company s electronic manufacturing service business are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
in general it is the company s policy to recognize revenue and related costs when the order has been shipped from our facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order except for consignment inventory 
consignment inventory is shipped from the company to an independent warehouse for storage or shipped directly to the customer and stored in a segregated part of the customer s own facility 
upon the customer s request for inventory  the consignment inventory is shipped to the customer if the inventory was stored offsite or transferred from the segregated part of the customer s facility for consumption  or use  by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue upon such transfer 
the company does not earn a fee for storing the consignment inventory 
the company provides a ninety day warranty for workmanship only and does not have any installation  acceptance or sales incentives  although the company has negotiated extended warranty terms in certain instances 
the company assembles and tests assemblies based on customers specifications 
historically the amount of returns for workmanship issues has been de minimus under the company s standard or extended warranties 
any returns for workmanship issues received after each period end are accrued in the respective financial statements 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company establishes inventory reserves for valuation  shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
the company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the company s inventories and cost of products sold 
the company records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
actual product demand or market conditions could be different than that projected by management 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
the company has adopted sfas no 
 which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
goodwill and other intangibles the company adopted on june   sfas no 
business combinations 
under sfas no 
 a purchaser must allocate the total consideration paid in a business combination to the acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the company to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
during the fourth quarter of the company completed its annual assessment of impairment regarding the goodwill recorded 
that assessment  supported by independent appraisals did not identify any impairment as of april  new accounting standards in june fasb interpretation accounting for uncertainty in income taxes was issued which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and earlier application of the provisions of this interpretation is encouraged if the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  in the period this interpretation is adopted 
the company has not yet determined the impact of fasb interpretation on its financial statements 
on june   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles 
the company adopted sfas at december   there is no material change to the company s operating results as a result of this adoption 
in december the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r on may  sfas r requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity award based on the grant date fair value 
the cost will be recognized in financial statements as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service 
the company has determined that the adoption sfas r will not have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations  eps and cash flows 
however  sfas r could have a material impact on the company s results of operation if additional options are granted 
on december   fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of act  was issued 
fsp fas provides companies additional time  beyond the financial reporting period during which the act took effect  to evaluate the act s impact on a company s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying statement fsp fas was effective upon issuance 
based on the company s analysis of the repatriation provision of the act  although not yet finalized  it is unlikely that the company had any foreign earnings to repatriate  and accordingly  the financial statements do not reflect any provisions for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 
the impact on the company has not been material 
in november the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 charter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of abnormal 
the statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  as of may   for the company and are to be applied prospectively 
the company does not believe the impact will be material 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides a deduction from income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out except for certain pre existing binding contracts of the existing extraterritorial income eti exclusion tax benefit for foreign sales which the world trade organization wto ruled was an illegal export subsidy 
the european union eu believes that the act fails to adequately repeal the illegal export subsidies because of the transitional provisions and has asked the wto to review whether these transitional provisions are in compliance with their prior ruling 
additionally  the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations
