this was the result of our fiscal year end being on the last saturday in december 
accordingly  all fiscal operational figures were higher than had fiscal been weeks in length 
the estimated impact on our net sales and net earnings due to the extra week of fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we completed the acquisitions of newmark international  inc newmark  a manufacturer of concrete and steel pole structures mainly for the north america utility industry  wj whatley  inc whatley  a manufacturer of fiberglass poles principally for outdoor lighting applications and the assets of sigma industries  inc sigma  a manufacturer of overhead sign structures mainly serving the eastern united states 
newmark is reported as part of the utility support structures segment and whatley and sigma are reported as part of the engineered support structures ess segment 
the results of these operations were included in our consolidated results starting on the closing dates of the acquisitions 
the newmark and whatley acquisitions were completed in the second quarter of and the sigma acquisition was completed in the third quarter of consolidated net sales increased as compared with due to a full year impact of acquisitions completed in million and higher selling prices associated with the rapid increase of steel costs throughout much of these net sales increases were offset somewhat by decreased sales volumes in the irrigation segment in  as compared with gross profit as a percent of sales increased  mainly resulting from the impact of higher selling prices 
in  our gross profit as a percent of net sales fell in our engineered support structures ess and utility support structures segments  as pricing actions taken in response to higher steel costs lagged steel cost increases 
in  gross profit percentages in these segments recovered to more historical levels  as steel costs were more stable in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in over levels  mainly due to the full year impact of the acquisitions completed in million  increased employee incentives of million due to increased profitability in  increased sales commissions associated with higher sales million and additional personnel costs related to the preparation of our new ess segment operation in china approximately million 
this plant is scheduled to begin production in the second quarter of net interest expense increased in mainly due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt  as compared with approximately million 
higher average borrowing levels in as compared to  due to the million of debt incurred to fund the acquisitions completed in also contributed to the increase in net interest expense 
the effective tax rate increased in due to million in taxes due to repatriation of foreign earnings 
on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law  which included a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal the cash dividends received in net of taxes paid was approximately million 
otherwise  our effective tax rate in was essentially unchanged from minority interest expenses were lower in than mainly due to lower earnings in our irrigation segment operations in brazil and south africa 
in addition  we increased our ownership interest in the brazil operation from to in  which contributed to lower minority interest expenses as compared with net earnings increased in due in part to a million pre tax expense in approximately million after taxes associated with the restructuring of our long term debt in earnings per share increased at a lower percentage than net earnings in from due to more fully diluted shares outstanding 
engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in as compared with was due to price increases related to steel cost increases and the full year impact in from the acquisitions million 
the improvement in gross profit mainly related to sales price increases 
in  we raised sales prices as our steel costs increased 
however  the impact of sales price increases generally lagged our cost increases  resulting in lower gross profit margins in sales prices lagged cost increases due to the backlog nature of our business and existing orders could not be re priced 
in  steel costs were more stable  which enabled our gross profit margins to improve to more traditional levels 
increased sg a spending principally resulted from the full year impact of higher employee incentives attributable to improved operating income in  as compared with million  the acquisitions million  and increased compensation costs in china to prepare for the start up of our second plant approximately million 
this plant is scheduled to begin production in the second quarter of all regions contributed to the improved operating income for the segment 
in europe  earnings improved by million as compared with due to increased volumes and cost structure reductions implemented in china s earnings improved million which was attributable to higher sales volumes and improved product pricing 
lighting and traffic products the increase in north american lighting and traffic structure sales in was partly due to the effect of a full year of activity from the acquisitions of whatley million and the full year impact of price increases implemented in in response to higher steel costs 
north american volumes were slightly down in as compared with we believe delays in the enactment of the highway bill in the us resulted in postponement of lighting projects and reduced demand in the transportation market 
the commercial lighting market remained stable in in europe  lighting sales were higher than due to a combination of higher selling prices to offset higher steel costs and an approximate volume increase due to improvement in economic conditions in our main market areas and sales of new products developed this year 
specialty products sales of specialty products were up from  mainly due to the full year of the acquisition of sigma approximately million 
wireless communication structures and components remained fairly stable in as compared to  reflecting relatively stable market conditions 
sales of wireless communication poles in china were down slightly from a very strong utility products this product line includes sales of utility structures for markets outside of north america 
sales improved in as compared with due to introduction of new utility structure products for the chinese market and export sales of utility structures outside of china 
we believe as china develops its electrical infrastructure  there will be a solid demand in the future for steel transmission  substation and distribution structures to help transport and distribute electrical power to users 
furthermore  we believe that china will continue to be a key part of our efforts to penetrate export utility structure markets 
utility support structures segment this segment includes the operations of newmark since its acquisition on april  and the north american utility structure operations that were previously part of the ess segment 
the increase in sales from to includes approximately million related to the full year impact of the newmark acquisition and the effect of increased selling prices to offset higher steel costs incurred in while sales volumes were comparable to  order rates were well above levels 
increased investment in the electrical transmission grid by utility companies and independent power producers resulted in higher order rates and backlogs in  as compared with gross profit improved in over  as margins returned to more traditional levels through increased pricing  while volumes were comparable to increased sg a expense in resulted from the full year impact of newmark million  increased incentives of million due to increased segment earnings and increased commissions of million due to increased segment sales in coatings segment coatings segment sales were slightly down in from mainly due to lower volumes  but favorably offset by higher prices due in part to increased zinc and natural gas costs that were passed on to the marketplace as price increases or surcharges 
gross profit improved mainly through increased factory productivity and lower workers compensation costs in  as compared with  of approximately million in our california operations 
improved safety procedures and changes in california workers compensation laws contributed to decreased workers compensation costs in irrigation segment sales were down in as compared to due to lower sales volumes in both domestic and international markets  partially offset by higher sales prices 
in north america  irrigation machine sales volumes were down approximately in  as compared with we believe relatively low farm commodity prices and higher input costs energy  fuel and fertilizer contributed to reduced demand for irrigation machines in most of our key markets around the world 
additionally  a weak us dollar also contributed to reduced sales demand in our international markets 
on a regional basis  sales decreases in south america and south africa were somewhat offset by improved sales in the asia pacific region 
gross profit decreased more than sales in  as compared with  due to decreased factory productivity associated with the decreased sales volumes 
the impact of lower factory productivity on gross profit was approximately million in in  sg a expenses decreased from due to reduced employee incentives associated with decreased operating income approximately million and to a bad debt reversal of million for a receivable that was recovered in tubing segment tubing segment sales increased in due to improved demand  partially offset by lower pricing  in certain markets 
gross profit was comparable to  despite the increase in sales volume 
gross profit margins were hampered in  as compared with  due to lower pricing and an unfavorable sales mix  partially offset by improved factory performance approximately million 
sg a expense was down in  due to decreased employee incentives resulting from lower growth in segment earnings 
other our other businesses include our machine tool accessory business in france  our industrial fastener business in the us  and wind energy development 
operating income decreased mainly due to increased research and development spending to develop a structure for the wind energy industry 
our spending on the wind energy initiative was million in  as compared with million in net corporate expense the most significant items that resulted in the increase in net corporate expense in as compared with were increased employee incentives of million related to improved net earnings in and approximately million related to the acquisition of a new corporate aircraft and the sale of our existing aircraft in fiscal compared with fiscal overview in  we completed three acquisitions 
on april   we completed the purchase of newmark international  inc newmark  a manufacturer of concrete and steel pole structures mainly for the electrical utility industry 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash including transaction costs  plus the assumption of approximately million of interest bearing debt 
on may   we completed the purchase of wj whatley  inc whatley  a manufacturer of fiberglass poles principally for outdoor lighting applications 
the purchase price for the whatley shares was approximately million in cash including transaction costs  plus the assumption of approximately million of interest bearing debt 
on august   we completed the purchase of the net assets of sigma industries  inc sigma  a manufacturer of overhead sign structures mainly serving the eastern united states 
the purchase price for the net assets of this business was approximately million  plus the assumption of approximately million of interest bearing debt 
the results of newmark are reported in the utility support structures segment and the results of whatley and sigma are reported in the engineered support structures segment 
the results of these operations are included in our consolidated results starting on the closing dates of the acquisitions 
the funds used for these acquisitions were borrowed through our existing credit facilities 
see also liquidity and capital resources 
steel is a significant cost component of the products we manufacture 
in  we experienced substantial cost increases for rolled sheet  plate and other products made from steel 
significant increases of steel production in china drove up prices and created shortages of key steel producing inputs such as coke  iron ore and scrap steel  which led to restricted steel supplies 
this situation in turn caused rapid  unprecedented increases in what we paid for steel and created availability issues 
in some cases  suppliers broke pricing agreements on or added surcharges to existing contracts 
firm pricing and consignment programs from the steel mills were no longer available  which  along with uncertain availability and extended lead times  led us to increase our steel inventories above historical norms to ensure our ability to meet customer commitments 
where possible  we increased our sales prices to mitigate the impact of higher steel costs on operating income 
the negative impact on operating income as a result of higher steel costs that could not be passed on in the marketplace was approximately million 
the increase in sales as compared with was due to the impact of acquisitions completed in million  sales volume increases in the engineered support structures ess and tubing segments and sales price increases resulting from steel cost increases 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was down as compared with  due mainly to the impact of steel cost increases not covered by sales price increases 
sg a spending increased mainly due to the impact from acquisitions million  increased employee incentives due to improved operating profit million  currency translation effects million and increased commissions related to higher sales volumes million 
the increase in interest expense in as compared with was due to higher average borrowing levels in these higher borrowing levels were due to acquisitions funded by borrowings million and higher working capital levels resulting from higher sales levels and increased inventories due to steel industry conditions mentioned above 
the million in debt prepayment expenses in relates to a charge we recorded in the second quarter of mainly related to the prepayment of our promissory notes as part of the refinancing of our long term debt 
the decrease in the effective tax rate relates primarily to a reduction of million in deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with net operating loss carryforwards in a european subsidiary due to improved profitability in that entity 
in  we recognized a profit in our share of the earnings of non consolidated subsidiaries  as compared with a loss in this improvement was the result of improved business conditions and operating performance of our non consolidated joint ventures in an irrigation distributor in argentina and a steel pole manufacturing facility in mexico 
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was comparable to  as lower net earnings in our irrigation segment operations in brazil and south africa were offset by improved earnings in our irrigation segment retail store operation in california 
our ownership percentages in these locations are less than 
due to our acquisition activity and lower operating cash flows in as compared with  we have higher interest bearing debt than at the end of fiscal accordingly  our long term debt to invested capital ratio increased from in to in while this ratio is in excess of our internal goal of  we believe that  with continued improvements in earnings and working capital management  we will be able to reduce this ratio to below our internal goal over the next to months 
engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment was related to the acquisition of whatley and sigma million  currency translation effects million  sales volume increases and sales price increases implemented to offset rising steel costs 
gross profit grew at a lower rate than sales  as sales price increases did not completely cover the increased cost of steel and the sales mix was unfavorable 
these factors were offset to a degree by improved gross margins in europe resulting from improved factory performance 
sg a spending was up mainly due to fiscal acquisitions million and currency translation effects million 
operating income improved in all regions  mainly as a result of sales volume increases in all regions  the impact of acquisitions million  and operational improvements in europe  where operating income improved by million in as compared with during  we reduced our cost structure in europe to position ourselves for better profitability 
while the impact of cost reductions was somewhat offset by severance costs  we believe that our current operating structure and management team are appropriate to allow us to build on for continued operating improvements 
operating profits in china grew by million in as compared with  due to continued sales growth 
lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales increased in as compared with due to a combination of a sales volume increase of approximately and sales price increases in response to higher steel prices 
market demand continues to be driven by government spending programs and the need for improved street and highway lighting and traffic control 
the current us federal highway program was extended throughout by a series of short term extensions and is currently extended through may we believe that a new six year spending program will be enacted in  which  if enacted  should provide for stability in the funding of projects that include street and area lighting and traffic structures 
commercial lighting sales in north america were down slightly in  as compared with competitive pricing in this market resulted in slightly lower orders from lighting fixture manufacturers  as some competitors did not increase sales prices as much as we did when steel prices escalated 
in europe  sales volumes increased modestly in local currency terms  as demand for lighting and traffic structures reflected slightly better economic conditions in our major market areas 
in china  sales were comparable to specialty products in north america  sales of specialty products were up approximately as compared with the most significant source of growth was from overhead sign structures 
in  we entered this market and was our first full year of operation 
sign structure sales of million in included those of sigma industries since its acquisition in august sales of wireless communication structures and components were up from a weak  as wireless carriers increased spending on new structures and antennas to improve coverage and service 
sales of wireless communication poles in china increased by approximately in as compared with  due to continued development of its wireless networks 
our sales of wireless structures in china have steadily grown over the years as we believe we have built a good reputation with the wireless carriers and benefited from the strong demand in wireless communication services in china 
while we expect relatively strong demand to continue in the future  growth rates may moderate from past growth rates 
utility products this product line includes sales of utility structures for markets outside of north america 
sales improved over  mainly due to sales growth in china of approximately million 
we continue to believe that as china grows its electrical generation and distribution capacity  we should see good demand for steel poles for electrical transmission  substation and distribution applications 
utility support structures segment the sharp increase in sales in as compared with was due to the acquisition of newmark in april million  improved sales volumes in our existing utility structures product line and increased sales prices 
while sales volumes of steel utility structures increased approximately in as compared with  our sales were particularly low in the second and third quarters of  when our order rates fell as we attempted to maintain pricing when market prices were falling 
newmark s sales volumes of concrete utility poles since its acquisition in april were approximately higher than the same period in in  demand for steel and concrete transmission  substation and distribution structures was stronger than in  as electrical utility companies increased spending for structures to improve the electrical grid system  despite the lack of us energy policy legislation 
gross profit improved at a higher rate than sales because the difficult pricing environment in improved somewhat in approximately million of the operating income improvement from to was due to the acquisition of newmark 
coatings segment coatings segment sales and profitability decreased in as compared with mainly due to lower anodizing service sales to a major customer 
while we still expect future sales to this customer  we do not expect such sales to return to historical levels 
in light of these lower sales volumes  we are making efforts to expand our anodizing customer base and strengthen our relationships with current customers 
we have also reduced our cost structure to further position ourselves for improved profitability in the future 
aside from the lower volumes  gross profit in this segment was also negatively impacted by approximately million of increased workers compensation costs in california 
we believe workers compensation reform legislation passed in california this year will help us better control workers compensation costs in the future 
galvanizing volumes were comparable to  with a modest improvement in profitability 
sg a spending in was comparable to irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment sales was due to price increases associated with increased steel costs 
in north america  sales volumes of irrigation machines and related service parts were down approximately in  as compared with while the agricultural economy in general was favorable throughout most of  weakness in commodity prices and higher energy and other farm input costs have contributed to weakness in demand in the latter part of profitability in north america was up by million in as compared with  due to improved retail operations  good expense control and disciplined product pricing in light of rising steel costs 
in markets outside of north america  sales were similar to  after consideration of currency translation effects 
sales in brazil and south africa were slightly lower than strong sales levels  reflecting somewhat weaker farm commodity prices 
the strong south african currency versus the us dollar has negatively impacted the competitiveness of farm exports in that region 
sales decreases in these regions were offset by stronger sales in other regions 
international profitability in was down by million from a strong  mostly related to lower operating income in brazil and south africa 
tubing segment tubing segment sales increased mainly through sales price increases to pass along increased steel costs  although sales volume was up approximately as well 
we believe that sales demand was driven to some extent by rapidly rising steel prices and our availability of steel 
the increase in gross profit was due to an improved pricing environment for our commodity type products  our ability to pass along increased steel costs to the market and an unfavorable inventory adjustment that was recorded in sg a expense was up in as compared to due to employee incentives million related to increased operating income and sales commissions million due to increased sales 
other our other businesses include our machine tool accessory business in france  our industrial fastener business in the us and wind energy development 
sales and profitability were down in  as compared with  due to approximately lower demand for machine tool accessories in europe 
our spending to develop a structure for the wind energy industry was million in as compared with million in we continue to make progress on this new product development initiative and we remain optimistic as to our future in this business 
net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expenses in as compared with mainly related to increased employee incentives associated with improved operating income approximately million  and approximately million in incremental costs related to compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at fiscal year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december   as compared with at december  the decrease in working capital mainly resulted from our use of operating cash flows to reduce our long term debt 
operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in and million in the increase in operating cash flow in as compared with related mainly to increased net income  lower inventory and accounts receivable and higher accounts payable levels as compared with in  availability issues  extended lead times and lack of firm pricing for steel resulted in higher inventory levels in and compared with historical levels 
these conditions eased in  which allowed us to decrease our inventory levels throughout investing cash flows capital spending was million in  as compared with million in  and million in the most significant capital expenditure in was the purchase of a corporate aircraft for million  which replaced an aircraft that was sold for approximately million in cash 
our depreciation and amortization expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
throughout much of the s our capital spending was relatively high as we added manufacturing capacity in a number of areas  most notably our irrigation segment factory in mccook  nebraska and our utility support structures factory in jasper  tennessee 
we have not made any substantial capacity additions in the past three years  except for a new ess segment manufacturing facility in southern china 
the total capital cost for the facility is expected to be approximately million million was expended in and is planned to start production in the second quarter of in addition  we made a number of acquisitions from through that added capacity and allowed us to expand our market coverage 
we do not anticipate a substantial increase in capital spending in the near future 
fiscal capital expenditures are estimated to be between and million 
the most significant investing cash flow item in was the million expended net of cash acquired related to the newmark  whatley and sigma acquisitions 
financing cash flows total interest bearing debt decreased from million in to million as of december   a decrease of million 
most of this decrease occurred in our revolving credit facility and bank term loan 
in december  we prepaid approximately million of our bank term loan 
the increase in interest bearing debt in was due to our acquisitions  which totaled million including million in debt that was assumed as part of the acquisitions 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at the end of fiscal this internal objective is exceeded from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities to grow and improve our businesses 
we believe the acquisitions described above were appropriate opportunities to expand our market coverage and product offerings and generate earnings growth 
while our long term debt to capital ratio exceeded our objective as a result of the newmark acquisition in april  our cash flows enabled us to reduce our long term debt levels to under of invested capital by september dependent on our level of acquisition activity and steel industry availability and pricing issues  we expect our long term debt to invested capital ratio to remain below in our priorities in use of future cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses pay down interest bearing debt invest in acquisitions clearly connected to our core businesses or an existing competency return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices our debt financing at december  consisted mainly of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million of senior subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in may we may repurchase the notes starting in may at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that accrues interest at our option at a the higher of the prime lending rate and the federal funds rate plus basis points or b an interest rate spread over the libor of to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in addition  this agreement provides that another million may be added to the total credit agreement at our request at any time prior to may   subject to the group of banks increasing their current commitment 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of may  and contains certain financial covenants that limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
term loan with a group of banks that accrues interest at our option at a the higher of the prime lending rate and the federal funds rate plus basis points or b libor plus a spread of to basis points  depending on our debt to ebitda ratio and had an outstanding balance of million at december  this loan requires quarterly principal payments through the annualized principal payments beginning in in millions are    and the effective interest rate on this loan was per annum at december  under these debt agreements  we are obligated by covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities 
our key debts covenants are that interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters and that our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
based on our available credit facilities and our history of positive cash flows from operations  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our short term cash needs 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations  various operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt capital leases unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the million of senior subordinated notes and the bank term loan million was outstanding at december  
we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit agreement at december  obligations under these agreements could be accelerated in event of non compliance with covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
capital leases relate principally to a production facility in france and transportation and office equipment 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
as of december   our interest obligations associated with our long term debt and capital leases were as follows in millions of dollars after unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel for periods up to one year 
we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
the most significant operating lease is the lease of our corporate headquarters office building in omaha  nebraska 
through  we leased the entire office complex and sublet other office space in the complex to outside parties 
the lease payments were based on the london interbank offer rate libor  plus a spread that varies depending on our financial leverage 
this lease also contained certain covenants that are similar to those in our revolving credit agreement  including covenants related to financial leverage and coverage of certain fixed charges 
the estimated fair value of the residual value guarantee at december  was approximately million  which was classified on the balance sheet in other noncurrent liabilities 
this lease was reviewed under the provisions of fas interpretation r consolidation of variable interest entities  and we determined that we were not required to consolidate the lessor entity because we were not the primary beneficiary 
subsequent to december   the office complex was sold and we executed a year operating lease for the office space in the complex that we occupy 
in addition  our residual value guarantee to the former lessor was terminated 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
except as noted below  these commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments the above commitments include million in loan guarantees of non consolidated subsidiaries in argentina and mexico and are in proportion to our ownership percentage of these companies or are accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
as prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  the fair value of the guarantees was million and is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our december  balance sheet 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  hot rolled steel prices have been volatile 
in  prices rose sharply early in the year before falling later in the year 
in  prices rose dramatically throughout much of the year 
the volatility in price over time was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years  including in  zinc prices rose rapidly throughout the year  reaching near record high prices in late our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to minimize the impact of volatility in prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
in  our strategies as they pertain to steel were not as effective as in the past  as suppliers discontinued fixed price contracts and consignment programs 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt is a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an impact on interest expense of approximately million in and million in foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are immaterial 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe south america asia south africa commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
annual us gas requirements are approximately  mmbtu 
we have purchased swaps totaling approximately of our expected us requirements through april the fair value of these instruments is based on quoted market prices from the nymex 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  our market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was approximately million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since we forward price only a portion of our natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas we purchase 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed periodically with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumption in our estimate is the rate we apply to those recent sales  which is based on historical claims experience 
if this estimated rate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
the remainder of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in  we experienced substantially higher costs to produce inventory than in  due mainly to higher costs for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income of approximately million than had all our inventory been valued on the fifo method 
the  prices decreased modestly and operating income would have decreased by approximately million had all of our inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional write downs of the inventory may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that were acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we value our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
the key assumptions are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under sfas  we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of most of our reporting units  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names and their values are separately assessed from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
this assessment is made using the relief from royalty method  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be our after tax cost of capital 
stock options our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we do not record any compensation expense on the income statement with respect to options granted to employees and directors 
alternatively  under gaap  we could have recorded a compensation expense based on the fair value of employee stock options 
as described in note in the consolidated financial statements  had we recorded a fair value based compensation expense for stock options  earnings per share would have been to less than what was reported for each of the  and fiscal years 
on december   the fasb issued statement no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require us to measure the cost of all employee stock based compensation awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning in the company s first quarter of fiscal we expect that the adoption of this standard will reduce our operating income by approximately million in and will not have a material affect on our cash flows 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while future taxable income and tax planning strategies are considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if a deferred tax asset is estimated to be not fully realizable in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets related mainly to operating and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  we removed million of prior valuation allowances and  accordingly  reduced our income tax expense  because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
if these circumstances change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million related to nonconsolidated subsidiaries 
these deferred tax assets relate to operating loss carryforwards and we do not believe that it is more likely than not that future earnings will be adequate to utilize these carryforwards before they expire 
accordingly  these deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation adjustment 
recently issued accounting pronouncements sfas r in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which requires us to recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
such expense will be recognized over the requisite service period of the stock option award  which is normally the vesting period 
the expense for awards granted after implementation of fasr will be based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
that estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of awards to vest will differ from the estimate 
the estimate of forfeitures does not materially impact our calculation of compensation expense 
currently  we disclose the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas as amended by sfas the requirements of sfas r are effective for us at the beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the expense that we will recognize in consists of grants made subsequent to december  and the unvested portion of options granted prior to december  for options granted prior to december   the expense that will be recognized will correspond to that which was calculated as part of our pro forma disclosures 
we plan to use the modified prospective method of adoption of this standard and we expect to record expense of approximately million in fiscal related to the unvested portion of options that were granted as of december  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
beginning with the options that are granted in  we plan to use a binomial model in calculating estimated fair value of stock options and recognizing that expense on a straight line basis over the requite service period of the award 
the binomial model uses more inputs than the black scholes model  and we believe the use of the binomial model will result in a better estimate of fair value than was previously used for purposes of determining the pro forma impact of sfas sfas in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
under this pronouncement  abnormal amounts of these costs are required to be charged against earnings rather than included in the cost of inventory on the balance sheet 
sfas no 
will be effective at the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
we do not believe this pronouncement will have a significant effect on our financial statements
