item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are an independent provider of financial and operational consulting services 
we commenced operations in may with a core group of experienced financial and operational consultants  composed primarily of former arthur andersen llp partners and professionals 
we have grown significantly since we commenced operations  nearly tripling the number of our consultants from on may  to as of december  in response to strong demand for our services  we began aggressively hiring consultants in the first quarter of and added over new consultants during while this aggressive hiring reduced our utilization rate determined by dividing the number of hours all of our consultants worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for all of our consultants during the same period  assuming a forty hour work week  less paid holidays and vacation days as we integrated our new hires  we believe the early 
table of contents results of this growth initiative are evident in our financial results 
revenues in totaled million for our first eight months of operations and rose to million in  our first full year of operations 
revenues in totaled million  a increase from revenues in totaled  a increase from we provide our services through two segments financial consulting and operational consulting 
our financial consulting segment provides services that help clients effectively address complex challenges that arise from litigation  disputes  investigations  regulation  financial distress and other sources of significant conflict or change 
our operational consulting segment provides services that help clients improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of their operations  reduce costs  manage regulatory compliance and maximize procurement efficiency 
revenues we derive all of our revenues from providing financial and operational consulting services through three principal types of billing arrangements consisting of time and expense  fixed fee and performance based 
we manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses 
we believe this is the most accurate reflection of our consulting services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that we bill to our clients at cost 
since our inception  most of our revenues have been generated from time and expense engagements 
in time and expense engagements  fees are based on the hours incurred at agreed upon billing rates 
time and expense engagements represented approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively 
in fixed fee engagements  we agree to a pre established fee in exchange for a pre determined set of consulting services 
we set the fees based on our estimates of the costs and timing for completing the fixed fee engagements 
it is the client s expectation in these engagements that the pre established fee will not be exceeded except in mutually agreed upon circumstances 
for the years ended december  and  fixed fee engagements represented approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
performance based fee engagements generally tie fees to the attainment of contractually defined objectives 
we enter into performance based engagements in essentially two forms 
first  we generally earn fees that are directly related to the savings formally acknowledged by the client as a result of adopting our recommendations for improving cost effectiveness in the procurement area 
second  we have performance based engagements in which we earn a success fee when and if certain pre defined outcomes occur 
often this type of success fee supplements time and expense or fixed fee engagements 
for example  our revenues for the second quarter of included a million success fee earned on a time and expense engagement that included a performance based component related to the completion of a series of asset sales transactions managed on behalf of a single financial consulting segment client over a two year period 
while performance based fee revenues represented approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively  such revenues in the future may cause significant variations in quarterly revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance based criteria 
our quarterly results are impacted principally by our utilization rate  the number of business days in each quarter and the number of our consultants who are available to work 
our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate 
our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients 
for example  during the third and fourth quarters of the year  vacations taken by our clients can result in the deferral of spending on existing and new engagements  which would negatively affect our utilization rate 
the number of business work days are also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter 
we typically have to fewer business work days available in the third and fourth quarters of the year  which can impact revenues during those periods 

table of contents reimbursable expenses reimbursable expenses that are billed to clients  primarily relating to travel and out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with engagements  are included in total revenues and reimbursable expenses  and typically an equivalent amount of these expenses are included in total direct costs and reimbursable expenses 
the amount of reimbursable expenses included in total revenues and reimbursable expenses may not always correspond with the amount of these expenses included in total direct costs and reimbursable expenses due to the fact that revenues from reimbursable expenses associated with performance based engagements may be deferred and recognized at a later date when the revenue on these engagements is recognized 
this treatment can result in a timing difference between when revenue from reimbursable expenses is recognized and when such expenses are recognized in the statement of operations 
such timing differences are eliminated when the performance based engagement is completed  as total cumulative revenues from reimbursable expenses will equal the total cumulative reimbursable expenses incurred on the engagement 
total direct costs our most significant expenses are costs classified as total direct costs 
these total direct costs primarily include direct costs consisting of salaries  performance bonuses  payroll taxes and benefits for consultants  as well as fees paid to independent subcontractors that we retain to supplement consulting personnel  typically on an as needed basis for specific client engagements 
total direct costs also include stock based compensation  which represents the cost of stock option and restricted stock awards granted to our consultants 
compensation for stock based awards is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which is generally four years 
as a result of the granting of restricted common stock awards and anticipated future awards  stock based compensation expense will increase in the future 
total direct costs also include intangible assets amortization relating to customer contracts 
operating expenses our operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  performance bonuses  payroll taxes and benefits for non billable professionals 
also included in this category are other sales and marketing related expenses  rent and other office related expenses  and professional fees 
other operating expenses include certain depreciation and amortization expenses not included in total direct costs and stock based compensation  which represents the cost of stock option and restricted stock awards granted to our non billable professionals 
compensation for stock based awards is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which is generally four years 
as a result of the granting of restricted common stock awards and anticipated future awards  stock based compensation expense will increase in the future 
segment results segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment  less the direct costs of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by the segment 
unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment 
these administrative function costs include corporate office support costs  all office facility costs  costs relating to accounting and finance  human resources  legal  marketing  information technology and company wide business development functions  as well as costs related to overall corporate management 
beginning january   the forensic technology and discovery services group was moved from the financial consulting segment to the operational consulting segment to improve marketing synergies with the legal business consulting practice 
previously reported segment information has been reclassified to reflect this change 

table of contents initial public offering on october   we completed our initial public offering 
in the initial public offering  we sold  shares of common stock and a selling stockholder  hcg holdings llc  sold  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
on october   the underwriters exercised in full their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock from the selling stockholder 
the initial public offering generated gross proceeds to us of million  or million net of underwriting discounts 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholder 
on october   we used million of the net proceeds to redeem the outstanding preferred stock  including cumulative dividends and a liquidation participation amount totaling million 
also on october   the company used million of the net proceeds to repay the notes payable to hcg holdings llc  including accrued and unpaid interest of million 
the costs associated with the initial public offering  which totaled million  were paid from the proceeds 
on may   we used a portion of the remaining net proceeds from the initial public offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of speltz weis llc 
we are using the remaining initial public offering proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital and potential business acquisitions 
acquisition of speltz weis llc on may   huron consulting group  inc acquired of the outstanding membership interests of speltz weis llc  a specialized consulting firm that consisted of consultants 
with the acquisition of speltz weis llc  our financial consulting segment can provide interim management  organizational renewal and turnaround services and other crisis management services to distressed hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was million  which consisted of million cash paid at closing  notes payable totaling million payable in three equal annual installments of million together with accrued interest at per annum beginning on may   and million of transaction costs 
additional purchase consideration may be payable based on the performance of speltz weis llc during the three year period beginning june  and ending may  also  additional payments may be made based on the amount of revenues we receive from certain referrals made by speltz weis llc employees 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of speltz weis operations have been included within the financial consulting segment in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make assessments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to impact our financial position and operating results 
while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important  we believe that there are six accounting policies that could be considered critical 
these critical policies relate to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services  carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets  valuation of net deferred tax assets and stock based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the related services are provided  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our services are primarily rendered under engagements that require the client to pay on a time and expense basis 
fees are based on the hours incurred at agreed upon rates and recognized as services are provided 
revenues related to fixed fee engagements are recognized based on estimates of work completed versus the total services to be provided under the engagement 
losses  if any  on fixed fee engagements are recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenues related to performance based engagements are recognized when all performance based criteria are met 
we also have contracts with clients to deliver multiple services that are covered under both individual and separate engagement letters 
these arrangements allow for our services to be valued and accounted for on a separate basis 
reimbursable expenses related to time and expense and fixed fee engagements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expense is incurred 
reimbursable expenses subject to performance based criteria are recognized as revenue when all performance criteria are met 
direct costs incurred on all types of engagements  including performance based engagements  are recognized in the period in which incurred 
differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue are recognized as either unbilled services or deferred revenue 
revenues recognized for services performed but not yet billed to clients are recorded as unbilled services 
amounts billed to clients but not yet recognized as revenues are recorded as deferred revenue 
client prepayments and retainers that are unearned are also classified as deferred revenue and recognized over future periods as earned in accordance with the applicable engagement agreement 
allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and for services performed but not yet billed for estimated losses based on several factors  including the historical percentages of fee adjustments and write offs by practice group  an assessment of a client s ability to make required payments and the estimated cash realization from amounts due from clients 
the allowances are assessed by management on a regular basis 
if the financial condition of a client deteriorates in the future  impacting the client s ability to make payments  an increase to our allowances might be required or our allowances may not be sufficient to cover actual write offs 
the provision for doubtful accounts and unbilled services is recorded as a reduction in revenue to the extent the provision relates to fee adjustments and other discretionary pricing adjustments 
to the extent the provision relates to a client s inability to make required payments on accounts receivables  the provision is recorded in operating expenses 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our goodwill balance as of december  was million  which resulted from the acquisition of speltz weis llc in the second quarter of under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever indications of impairment exist 
we have elected and will begin to perform this annual impairment test in the second quarter of or earlier if indications of impairment arise  such as loss of key personnel  unanticipated competition  or other unforeseen developments 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 
an impairment test involves considerable management judgment and estimates regarding future operating results and cash flows 
intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill 
our intangible assets balances  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at december  and primarily consist of customer contracts and relationships relating to the speltz weis llc 
table of contents acquisition  as well as purchased technology 
we obtained a third party valuation to assist us in estimating the initial fair value of intangible assets acquired through the speltz weis llc acquisition 
these valuations are primarily based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows expected to be derived from the client contracts and relationships  discounted for assumptions about future customer attrition 
we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
therefore  higher or earlier than expected customer attrition may result in higher future amortization charges or an impairment charge for customer related intangible assets 
for example  during the third quarter of  we wrote off a portion of the intangible assets pertaining to a customer contract as described in client bankruptcy case below 
valuation of net deferred tax assets we have recorded net deferred tax assets as we expect to realize future tax benefits related to the utilization of these assets 
although we experienced net losses early in our history  no valuation allowance has been recorded relating to these deferred tax assets because we believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to utilize these assets 
should we determine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of these deferred tax assets  we would need to establish a valuation allowance  which would be recorded as a charge to income in the period the determination was made 
while utilization of these deferred tax assets will provide future cash flow benefits  they will not have an effect on future income tax provisions 
stock based compensation the accounting for stock based compensation is complex  and under certain circumstances  gaap allows for alternative methods 
as permitted  we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and have elected the disclosure option of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
requires that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value  or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the notes to the financial statements 
accordingly  we have measured compensation expense for stock options that we have granted to employees as the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price 
the calculated stock based compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis by charges to earnings over the vesting period of the applicable options 
given the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  we established an estimated fair value of the common stock as well as the exercise price for the options to purchase this stock 
we estimated the fair value of our common stock by evaluating our results of business activities and projections of our future results of operations

table of contents million in the year ended december  compared to million in we added a number of non billable professionals during the past year to continue to support a public company infrastructure 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative costs in the year ended december  compared to year ended was due to increases in recruiting costs  promotion and marketing costs  rent and other facility costs  legal fees  and new costs associated with being a public company  including sarbanes oxley compliance 
additionally  during in connection with a secondary offering that was withdrawn in november and a secondary offering that was completed in february  we incurred costs totaling million after tax  or per diluted share 
these costs were expensed in the period incurred because we did not issue securities in either offering

in conjunction with the speltz weis llc acquisition  we recorded million of intangible assets representing customer relationships  which is being amortized over a weighted average life of months 
also included in amortization expense in the year ended december  is a million charge representing the write off of an intangible asset relating to a speltz weis llc customer contract  as described in client bankruptcy case below 
operating expenses in the year ended december  also included a million pre tax restructuring charge associated with the closing of two small  underperforming offices in miami  florida and palo alto  california 
the charge consisted of approximately million for severance payments for the ten employees formerly employed at these locations  which were paid by april   and million for office lease payments  which were paid by august  additionally  during we eliminated a service offering in a practice area in the operational consulting segment that was not meeting our expectations and we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
operating income operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues and the absence of restructuring charges  partially offset by the increases in direct costs and operating expenses as discussed above 
operating margin  which is defined as operating income expressed as a percentage of revenues  was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  as described in client bankruptcy case below  one of our clients filed for bankruptcy in as a result  new financial terms and conditions  including billing terms and rates for our services  were negotiated pursuant to a new engagement contract 
these new terms will have a negative impact on our operating margins in due to the factors listed below  we expect our direct costs and operating expenses to increase in as compared to between april  and december   we increased our headcount by employees  representing a increase from march   to address continued demand for our services 
the majority of our headcount growth was experienced in our operational consulting segment 

table of contents during  we increased the number of our managing directors who are consultants from at december  to at december  in addition  in january  we promoted of our employees to the managing director level  compared to in january during  we expect to continue to hire additional managing directors 
we anticipate that some of these managing directors will initially focus their time on sales efforts during the first part of and may not be fully productive until later in in  we expect to hire additional managers  associates and analysts to expand support for our existing practices and better leverage our managing directors and directors 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we entered into new lease agreements for two of our offices  including one in new york city 
as a result of the costs associated with these factors  combined with anticipated ongoing growth in our business activity and the reduced billing rates at a client who filed for bankruptcy as described in client bankruptcy case below  we expect our operating margin for the first quarter of to be lower than the operating margin we experienced in the first quarter of  as we absorb these costs during the first part of although we expect operating margins to increase over the remainder of the year as we fully integrate our new hires and leverage the lease investments we made in the second half of  there can be no assurance that our expectations will be met and therefore our operating margins may be less than we expect 
net income attributable to common stockholders net income attributable to common stockholders increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income  partially offset by an increase in weighted average shares resulting from our initial public offering
