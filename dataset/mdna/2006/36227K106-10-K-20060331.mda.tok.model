there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in raising such additional funds 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in preparing the company s financial statements  management makes several estimates and assumptions that affect the company s reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
those accounting estimates that have the most significant impact on the company s operating results and place the most significant demands on management s judgment are discussed below 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates may require adjustment 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
the majority of the company s revenue is derived through the sale of uniquely designed systems containing hardware  software and other materials under fixed price contracts 
in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the revenue under these fixed price contracts is accounted for on the percentage of completion method 
this methodology recognizes revenue and earnings as work progresses on the contract and is based on an estimate of the revenue and earnings earned to date  less amounts recognized in prior periods 
the company bases its estimate of the degree of completion of the contract by reviewing the relationship of costs incurred to date to the expected total costs that will be incurred on the project 
estimated contract earnings are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses  and the cumulative effect of any change in estimate is recognized in the pe riod in which the change is identified 
estimated losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified 
the company recognizes revenue arising from contract claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and realization is probable and there is a legal basis of the claim 
uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity  material costs  change order scope and pricing  software modification and customer acceptance issues 
the reliability of these cost estimates is critical to the company s revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause the company s revenue and related margins to change significantly from the amounts estimated in the early stages of the project 
as the company recognizes revenue under the percentage of completion method  it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical and projected claims experience 
the company s long term contracts generally provide for a one year warranty on parts  labor and any bug fixes as it relates to software embedded in the systems 
the company s system design contracts do not provide for post customer support service pcs in terms of software upgrades  software enhancements or telephone support 
in order to obtain pcs  the customers must purchase a separate contract 
such pcs arrangements are generally for a one year period renewable annually and include customer support  unspecified software upgrades  and maintenance releases 
the company recognizes revenue from these contracts ratably over the life of the agreements in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of software licenses which do not require significant modifications or customization for the company s modeling tools are recognized when the license agreement is signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from certain consulting or training contracts are recognized on a time and material basis 
for time and material type contracts  revenue is recognized based on hours incurred at a contracted labor rate plus expenses 
capitalization of computer software development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes computer software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established  but prior to the release of the software product for sale to customers 
once the product is available to be sold  the company amortizes the costs  on a straight line method  over the estimated useful life of the product  which normally ranges from three to five years 
as of december   the company has net capitalized software development costs of  on an annual basis  and more frequently as conditions indicate  the company assesses the recovery of the unamortized software computer costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product 
if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs the company will write down the investment to its estimated fair value based on future discounted cash flows 
the excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related net realizable value is written down and charged to operations 
significant changes in the sales projections could result in an impairment with respect to the capitalized software that is reported on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income tax valuation allowance 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
as required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  management makes a regular assessment of the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income of the company in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred income tax asset to its realizable value 
as of december   the company s largest deferred tax asset related to a us net operating loss carryforward of million which expires in various amounts over the next twenty years 
the amount of loss carryforward which can be used by the company may be significantly limited 
the recovery of the net deferred tax asset could not be substantiated by currently available objective evidence 
accordingly  the company has established a million valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets
