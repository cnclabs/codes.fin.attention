item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary we believe that we are recovering from the substantial adverse impact on our businesses that resulted from the criminal and civil proceedings and related publicity surrounding martha stewart s sale of non company stock in december we first felt that impact when the negative publicity began in june  and though not all the related legal proceedings have concluded  in our business solidly improved 
those improvements include an increase in advertising pages and rates as well as improved circulation trends at our flagship magazine  martha stewart living  the launch of our new syndicated television program  martha  as well as an overall improvement in consumer sentiment towards our brands 
we also are cautiously optimistic about similar improvements in certain other areas of the company  including growth in advertising pages and revenue in certain of the company s other magazines 
additionally  the company has begun to benefit from the fourth quarter launch of a martha stewart branded satellite radio channel on sirius satellite radio 
in we anticipate reinvesting a portion of our advertising revenue into building a more functional website that will allow us to take full advantage of the growth in online media 
the investment will include further development in content areas such as crafts  recipes  and holidays 
our goal is to provide our users a central hub to interact with our rich multi media content library and growing branded product offering 
in january  we announced that we entered into a licensing relationship with ek success  ltd and gtcr golder rauner  llc to create  market and sell paper based craft products 
we expect to launch these martha stewart crafts products in the fourth quarter of or the first quarter of we expect the products will be available in a variety of craft stores nationwide 
we anticipate recording the revenue related to this licensing arrangement in our merchandising segment 
in october of  we announced that we entered into a licensing relationship with kb home  inc to design and style interior and exterior components for new homes in carey  north carolina 
the first models were completed in early in february  we announced an expanded agreement with kb home 
under the new agreement  we anticipate collaborating with kb home on martha stewart branded homes throughout the united states 
as part of the agreement  we intend to create a line of interior and exterior home products or design options to be offered exclusively in kb studios nationwide 
we anticipate recording the revenue related to our licensing arrangement with kb home  inc in our merchandising segment 
on september  we launched our new syndicated television program  martha 
viewer response to the show has been favorable and the show was recently nominated for six daytime emmy awards 
in january  we announced that season two of martha will be available in more than of us television households 
although we expect that the show will have only a marginal  if any  economic value to us  and may not be profitable  we believe that it has great promotional value for the company s businesses and products  especially during the company s turnaround phase 
additionally  as part of an agreement with mark burnett  an influential producer of television programming  the company participated in the production of a primetime network television series titled  the apprentice martha stewart 
while mso did not have a direct financial ownership interest in this show  we believe that we benefited from the program s promotion of the company s brands  products  and business 
we further believe that this program exposed the brand to a wider audience of viewers  consumers and business partners 
related to this program  mark burnett vested in of a warrant we issued to him to purchase a total of million shares at an exercise price of 
the non cash charge relating to the vesting of this portion of the grant of million was included in our corporate segment 
as part of the agreement with mark burnett in conjunction with his role as executive producer of our syndicated television show martha  mark burnett vested in a second of the million shares covered by the warrant 
the non cash charge relating to the vesting of this portion of the grant of million was included in the broadcasting segment 
in the aggregate  the total non cash charge relating the vesting of of the million shares covered by the warrant was million 
under the terms of this warrant  the third tranche ie   shares will not vest 
in the first half of  however  we began negotiating with mr 
burnett regarding his continued services and compensation  if such negotiations result in an agreement  the terms may include the grant of a new warrant covering a number of shares similar in magnitude to the unvested tranche from the original warrant 
while we account for the non cash charge based on a fair value methodology  the actual impact to the company and its shareholders in the form of dilution will be the issuance of common shares 

table of contents currently  the internet segment principally consists of the online content portion of our business  as well our online floral business  marthasflowers 
com 
in august  we decided to discontinue martha stewart the catalog for living and its online product offerings 
those businesses had been included as part of our internet segment but were not profitable 
the company s current agreement with kmart provides for certain minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
due principally to store closures since the signing of the agreement in june  kmart has closed approximately of its stores and lower same store sales  we expect the minimum guarantees will significantly exceed the royalties that otherwise would be earned from actual retail sales through for the contract years ending january  and the extension years  the minimum guarantees will be substantially lower than in prior years 
the specific computation is discussed in the paragraph below 
the following are the minimum guaranteed royalty payments in millions over the term of the agreement minimum royalty amounts for the year ending january   the minimum royalty amount is the greater of million or of the earned royalty for the year ending january  for the year ending january  the minimum royalty amount is the greater of million or of the earned royalty for the year ending january  furthermore  up to million of the january  and january  minimum royalty payments and million of the january  and january  minimum royalty payments  but not more than million in the aggregate over the term of the agreement  will be deferred and subject to recoupment in the periods ending january  and january  the company will adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
in the company expects to recognize expense of  from unvested options due to the implementation of statement r 
the majority of the expense will be in the corporate segment

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations several of our businesses can experience fluctuations in quarterly performance 
for example  our publishing segment results can vary from quarter to quarter due to publication schedules 
revenues from the merchandising segment can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to new product launches and the seasonality of certain product lines 
in addition  we recognize a substantial portion of the revenue resulting from the difference between the minimum royalty amount under the kmart contract and royalties paid on actual sales in the fourth quarter of each year  when the amount can be determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets and accrued losses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve the highest degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the emerging issues task force reached a consensus in may on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf which became effective for revenue arrangements entered into in the third quarter of in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  eitf provides guidance to determine a how the arrangement consideration should be measured  b whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting  and c how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the company has applied the guidance included in eitf in establishing revenue recognition policies for its arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for agreements with multiple deliverables  if the company is unable to put forth vendor specific objective evidence required under eitf to determine the fair value of each deliverable  then the company will account for the deliverables as a combined unit of accounting rather than separate units of accounting 
as a result  revenue is recognized as products and services are delivered 
we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned 
revenues and associated accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for estimated future returns  doubtful accounts and other allowances 
newsstand revenues in our publishing segment and product sales in our internet segment are recognized based upon assumptions with respect to future returns 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and current market conditions 
reserves are adjusted regularly based upon actual results 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
revenues for royalties in our merchandising business are accrued on a monthly basis based on sales volume provided to us by our partners and payment is generally made by our partners on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we recognize a substantial portion of the revenue resulting from the difference between the minimum royalty amount under the kmart contract and royalties paid on actual sales in the fourth quarter of each year  when the amount can be determined 
some of our other merchandising agreements also contain minimum guarantee provisions 
these minimum guarantees will be recorded when such amounts are both determinable and deemed collectible 
television advertising revenues are recorded when the related commercial is aired and is recorded net of estimated reserves for television audience underdelivery and bad debts 
television royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with specific terms of each agreement 

table of contents television production costs television production costs are capitalized and amortized based upon estimates of future revenues to be received and future costs to be incurred for the applicable television product 
the company bases its estimates on existing contracts for programs  historical advertising rates and ratings as well as market conditions 
estimated future revenues and costs are adjusted regularly based upon actual results and changes in market and other conditions 
intangible assets a substantial portion of our intangible assets is goodwill 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
all of the company s goodwill is attributable to certain magazines in its publishing segment 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit magazines in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
in and  the company estimated future cash flows based upon individual magazine historical results  current trends and operating cash flows to access the fair value 
in  the company engaged an external valuation services firm to report on the fair value of the company s goodwill 
no impairment charges were recorded in  and long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
advertising cost advertising costs  consisting primarily of direct response advertising  are expensed in the period in which the advertising effort takes place 
non cash equity compensation we currently have several stock incentive plans that permit us to grant various types of share based incentives to key employees  directors and consultants 
the primary types of incentives granted under these plans are stock options and restricted shares of common stock 
restricted shares are valued at the market value of traded shares on the date of grant  while stock options are valued using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires numerous assumptions  including  expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the option
