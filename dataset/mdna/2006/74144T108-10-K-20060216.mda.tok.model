item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general 
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios 
investment advisory clients outside the united states account for of our assets under management at december  we manage a broad range of us and international stock  bond  and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors 
investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 
financial market results in the united states during were mixed with the three major stock market indexes falling below end of levels for much of the year 
there were periods of strength  however  as all three indexes reached four year highs before falling back late in the year 
investor concerns about rising interest rates and record high fuel prices were compounded by the hurricane damage to the gulf coast region of the united states 
military action  terrorism and the uncertainties surrounding the strength of the us economy also continued to weigh on the financial markets 
the s p closed with the best performance among the indexes  posting a modest return for the year 
the nasdaq index  which is heavily weighted with technology companies  ended the year up only while the dow jones industrials closed down 
for the year 
foreign equity markets were stronger in  with the dow jones latin america  asia pacific  and europe indexes all outperforming their us counterparts 
lower global interest rates  higher corporate profits  and stronger economic conditions  including those in emerging markets  broadly presented favorable conditions for the financial markets outside the united states 
as for fixed income securities  yields for year us treasuries rose only to close at 
by year end  the yield curve had inverted with short term rates exceeding long term rates and investors worried about the possibility of a pending economic downturn 
the federal reserve continued its series of 
increases in  pushing the target short term rate up basis points over the course of the year to 
as began  the federal reserve signaled that its series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end 
despite this less than robust financial environment in  total assets under our management ended at a record billion  up billion during the year

the underlying investment portfolios consist of billion in the t 
rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and billion in other investment portfolios that we manage  including separately managed accounts  sub advised funds  and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 
in an improving market environment for  we would expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients 
these efforts may involve significant costs that precede the recognition of any future revenues that we may realize from increases to our assets under management

contractual obligations 
the following table in millions presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees 
because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature  we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations 
the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in and future years 
total later noncancelable operating leases other purchase commitments we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional equity investments totaling million at december  critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives 
further  significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet  the revenues and expenses in our statement of income  and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements 
making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time 
accordingly  actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements and notes 
we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this annual report 
in the following discussion  we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities 
we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available for sale 
at the end of each quarter  we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 
a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence  such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end  to overcome that presumption 
we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near term recovery is possible 
a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary that is impaired is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer s financial condition and our ability and intent to hold these investments until fair value recovers  which may mean until maturity  and to collect all contractual cash flows 
minor impairments of or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach 
we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit  our investment advisory business 
goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business 
our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds the carrying amount basically  our stockholders equity and  therefore  that no impairment exists 
should we reach a different conclusion in the future  additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non cash impairment charge to be recognized 
we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred 
the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet  million 
provision for income taxes 
after compensation and related costs  our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense 
we operate in several states and several countries through our various subsidiaries  and must allocate our income  expenses  and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations 
annually  we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities 
each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations 
from time to time  we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to  or in the process of  being audited by various tax authorities 
because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates  it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements 
as a result  additions to  or reductions of  income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 
we recognize any such prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 
stock options 
the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants 
fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter term  market traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations  including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date  the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period  and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time 
our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted 
unlike most of our expenses  the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non cash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 
pending change in accounting for stock option based compensation 
on january   we will adopt the provisions of sfas r  and begin recognizing stock option based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method applied on a modified prospective basis 
it is important to note that this change to the fair value based method will not diminish stockholders equity 
the following table in thousands presents the future compensation expense attributable to the  nonvested options and  restricted shares outstanding at december  future stock based compensation expense is estimated in a manner similar to that used in making our historical pro forma disclosures discussed above  except that  in order to conform to the requirements of sfas r  we have also included a reduction for estimated future forfeitures of our stock incentive awards 
estimated future compensation expense will change to reflect future option grants including reloads  future share awards  changes in estimated forfeitures  and adjustments for actual forfeitures 
the estimated income tax benefits presented will also vary as compensation expense changes and employees disqualify their incentive stock options  as well as to reflect changes in our effective income tax rate

forward looking information 
from time to time  information or statements provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price  including those within this report  may contain certain forward looking information  including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income  changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management  our expense levels  and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions 
readers are cautioned that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of t 
rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information because of various factors including  but not limited to  those discussed below and in item a of this form k annual report under the caption risk factors 
further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management 
such changes result from many factors including  among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t 
rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios  fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management  our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios  and changes in retirement savings trends favoring participant directed investments and defined contribution plans 
the ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence  the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes  the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management  and broader financial services sectors  and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business 
our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses  which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states  variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  stock option grants  stock awards  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  any goodwill impairment that may arise  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations  expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  depreciation  amortization  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure  unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients  and disruptions of services  including those provided by third parties  such as facilities  communications  power  and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation  and changes in legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results  including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general  or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management 
accordingly  declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 
we invest in our sponsored mutual funds  which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk  that is  the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares 
each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices  credit ratings  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares 
this potential future loss of value  before any income tax benefits  reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund s lowest fair value per share during in considering this presentation  it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day  it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted  and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 
fair value at potential december  of lower of portfolio value portfolio potential loss stock funds bond funds the comparable potential loss of value presented in our annual report was million on sponsored mutual fund investments of million at december  during  we actually experienced net unrealized gains of million 
investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds  by their nature  are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments 
t 
rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds 
in addition  investment holdings may be altered from time to time  in response to changes in market risks and other factors  as deemed appropriate by management 
the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk 
if interest rates change  the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 
we also have other investments of million at december  that are included in our balance sheet in other assets 
we are at risk for losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate  however  our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
additionally  we recognize our yen investment in a interest of daiwa sb investments japan at million using the historical cost basis of accounting 
our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
we operate in several foreign countries  most prominent among which is great britain 
we incur operating expenses and have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations  though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations
