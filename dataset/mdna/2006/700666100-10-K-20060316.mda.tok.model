item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of park ohio holdings corp 
and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the historical financial information is not directly comparable on a year to year basis  primarily due to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance in  debt extinguishment costs and writeoff of deferred financing costs associated with the tender and early redemption during of our senior subordinated notes  restructuring and unusual charges in and  a goodwill impairment charge in to reflect the cumulative effect of an accounting change  and acquisitions and divestitures during the three years ended december  executive overview we are an industrial supply chain logistics and diversified manufacturing business  operating in three segments ils  aluminum products and manufactured products 
ils provides customers with integrated supply chain management services for a broad range of high volume  specialty production components 
ils customers receive various value added services  such as engineering and design services  part usage and cost analysis  supplier selection  quality assurance  bar coding  product packaging and tracking  just in time and point of use delivery  electronic billing and ongoing technical support 
the principal customers of ils are in the heavy duty truck  automotive and vehicle parts  electrical distribution and controls  power sports fitness equipment  hvac  aerospace and defense  electrical components  appliance and semiconductor equipment industries 
aluminum products casts and machines aluminum engine  transmission  brake  suspension and other components such as pump housings  clutch retainers pistons  control arms  knuckles  master cylinders  pinion housings  brake calipers  oil pans and flywheel spacers for automotive  agricultural equipment  construction equipment  heavy duty truck and marine equipment oems  primarily on a sole source basis 
aluminum products also provides value added services such as design and engineering and assembly 
manufactured products operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly engineered products including induction heating and melting systems  pipe threading systems  industrial oven systems  injection molded rubber components  and forged and machined products 
manufactured products also produces and provides services and spare parts for the equipment it manufactures 
the principal customers of manufactured products are oems  sub assemblers and end users in the steel  coatings  forging  foundry  heavy duty truck  construction equipment  bottling  automotive  oil and gas  rail and locomotive manufacturing and aerospace and defense industries 
sales  earnings and other relevant financial data for these three segments are provided in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
sales and profitability continued to grow substantially in  continuing the trend of the prior year  as the domestic and international manufacturing economies continued to grow 
net sales increased and net income increased in compared to net income was affected by a million reversal of the tax valuation allowance and million of restructuring charges 
million reflected in cost of products sold and million in restructuring and impairment charges 

table of contents during  net sales increased  and net income was million compared to a net loss of in during  we reinforced our long term availability and attractive pricing of funds by refinancing both of our major sources of borrowed funds senior subordinated notes and our revolving credit facility 
in november  we sold million of senior subordinated notes due we used the net proceeds to fund the tender and early redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes due we incurred debt extinguishment costs primarily related to premiums and other transaction costs associated with the tender offer and early redemption and wrote off deferred financing costs totaling million associated with the repurchased senior subordinated notes 
in december  we amended our revolving credit facility  extending its maturity so that it now expires in december  increasing the credit limit so that we may borrow up to million subject to an asset based formula  and providing lower interest rate levels 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all our assets 
we had approximately million of unused borrowing availability at december  funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are expected to be adequate to meet our cash requirements 
at the end of december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of lectrotherm  which is primarily a provider of field service and spare parts for induction heating and melting systems  located in canton  ohio  for million cash funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
this acquisition augments our existing  high margin aftermarket induction business 
lectrotherm had no significant affect on earnings 
in july  we acquired substantially all the assets of ppg  a provider of supply chain management services for a broad range of production components for million cash funded with borrowings from our revolving credit facility  
million in a short term note payable and the assumption of approximately million of trade liabilities 
this acquisition added significantly to the customer and supplier bases  and expanded our geographic presence of our ils segment 
ils has already eliminated substantial overhead cost and begun the process of consolidating redundant service centers 
we acquired substantially all of the assets of the amcast components group amcast  a producer of aluminum automotive products  on august  for million cash and the assumption of approximately million of operating liabilities 
this acquisition significantly increased the sales and production capacity of our aluminum products business and added attractive new customers  product lines and production technologies 
we acquired the remaining of the common stock of japan ajax magnethermic company jamco  now a japanese located subsidiary of our induction heating and melting equipment business  on april  for cash existing on the balance sheet of jamco at that date 
we sold substantially all the assets of st 
louis screw and green bearing in first quarter for cash totaling approximately million 
accounting changes and goodwill we elected to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
compensation expense resulting from fixed awards of restricted shares was measured at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period 
an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation would have been the fair value method defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
fas permitted use of the intrinsic value method and did not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
if compensation cost for stock options granted had been determined based on the fair value method of fas  our net income 
table of contents loss and diluted income loss per share would have been decreased or increased by million

per share in in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes a fair value measurement objective in determining the value of such a cost 
fas r was effective as of january  fas r is a revision of fas and supersedes apb the adoption of fair value recognition provisions for stock options is expected to increase the company s fiscal compensation expense by million before tax 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  we review goodwill annually for potential impairment 
this review was performed as of october   and  using forecasted discounted cash flows  and it was determined that no further impairment is required

aluminum products sales increased in primarily due to sales from manufacturing plants acquired in august from the amcast  partially offset by volume decreases in the automotive industry 
manufactured products sales increased in primarily in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses

table of contents of a customer  murray  inc aluminum products gross margin decreased due to the addition of the lower margin amcast business  product mix and pricing changes and the increased cost of natural gas 
gross margin in the manufactured products segment increased  primarily as a result of increased sales and overhead efficiencies achieved in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses  and also due to

the company expects a further 
million negative impact to sg a expenses in the first quarter of resulting from the dana bankruptcy 
sg a expenses were reduced in compared to by a 
million increase in net pension credits reflecting improved returns on pension plan assets 
other than these changes  sg a expenses remained essentially flat  despite increased sales and production volumes 
sg a expenses as a percent of sales decreased by

interest expense year ended december  percent change change interest expense debt extinguishment costs included in interest expense average outstanding borrowings average borrowing rate basis points interest expense decreased in compared to  primarily due to the fourth quarter debt extinguishment costs 
these costs primarily related to premiums and other transaction costs associated with the tender offer and early redemption and writeoff of deferred financing costs associated with the senior subordinated notes 
excluding these costs  interest increased in due to higher average outstanding borrowings  partially offset by lower average interest rates during the increase in average borrowings in resulted primarily from higher working capital requirements and the purchase of amcast components group and ppg in august and july  respectively 
the lower average borrowing rate in was due primarily to the lower interest rate of on our senior subordinated notes sold in november compared to the interest rate on the senior subordinated notes outstanding during the first eleven months of the lower average borrowing rate in included increased interest rates under our revolving credit facility compared to  which increased primarily as a result of actions by the federal reserve

based on strong recent and projected earnings  the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the tax valuation allowance reversal resulted in an increase to net income for the quarter 
in  the company will begin recording a quarterly provision for federal income taxes  which is expected to result in a total effective income tax rate of approximately 
the company s significant net operating loss carry forward should preclude the payment of cash federal income taxes in and  and possibly beyond 
in the fourth quarter of  the company will reassess the remaining tax valuation allowance 
if it is determined that a portion or all of the remaining deferred tax asset will more likely than not be realized  then the appropriate portion of its remaining tax valuation allowance will be reversed into income at that time  which could increase net income by as much as million 
we had income tax benefits of million in  including a million reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this was an effective income tax benefit rate of 
the provision for income taxes was million in  an effective income tax rate of 
excluding the reversal of the million tax valuation allowance  in we provided million of income taxes  an effective income tax rate 
in both years  these taxes consisted primarily of state and foreign taxes on profitable operations 
in neither year did the income tax provision include federal income taxes 
at december   our subsidiaries had million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes 
we are presenting taxes and tax rates without the tax benefit of the tax valuation allowance reversal to facilitate comparison between the periods 
results of operations versus net sales by segment year ended december  percent change change ils aluminum products manufactured products consolidated net sales net sales increased by in compared to ils sales increased due to general economic growth  in particular due to significant growth in the heavy duty truck and semiconductor industries  the addition of new customers and increases in product range to existing customers 
ils growth was partially offset by a million sales decrease related to the sale of green bearing 
aluminum products sales increased million due to the amcast components group acquisition in august  with additional growth from new contracts and increased volumes in the existing business 

table of contents manufactured products sales increased primarily in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses 
of this increase  million was due to the second quarter acquisition of the remaining of the common stock of jamco  partially offset by the divestiture of st 
louis screw in the first quarter of cost of products sold gross profit year ended december  percent change change consolidated cost of products sold consolidated gross profit gross margin cost of products sold increased in compared to  while gross margin increased to from in ils gross margin decreased modestly  primarily due to steel price increases and mix changes and the negative impact of million resulting from the bankruptcy of a significant customer  murray  inc aluminum products gross margin decreased due to a combination of the addition of the lower margin amcast business  product mix and pricing changes and specific one time costs incurred in for product startup  scrap and reserves 
the million of sales from the acquired amcast business generated significantly lower margins than the existing aluminum products business 
we expect margins at the acquired plants to increase over time as a result of post acquisition cost reductions  price increases and new business 
gross margin in the manufactured products segment increased  primarily as a result of increased sales and overhead efficiencies achieved in the induction equipment  pipe threading equipment and forging businesses 
gross margins in both the aluminum products and manufactured products segments were negatively impacted by rising natural gas costs 
sg a expenses year ended december  percent change change consolidated sg a expenses sg a percent consolidated sg a expenses increased by in compared to approximately million of the sg a increase was due to acquisitions  primarily jamco and amcast components group  while approximately million of the increase was due to compliance costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the remainder of the sg a increase was primarily due to increased sales and production volumes 
despite this increase  sg a expenses as a percent of sales decreased by basis points due both to cost reductions from restructuring and to the absorption of these expenses over increased sales 
sg a expenses were reduced in compared to by a million increase in net pension credits reflecting improved returns on pension plan assets 
interest expense year ended december  percent change change interest expense debt extinguishment costs included in interest expense average outstanding borrowings average borrowing rate basis points 
table of contents interest expense increased in compared to  primarily due to the fourth quarter debt extinguishment costs 
these costs primarily related to premiums and other transaction costs associated with the tender and early redemption and writeoff of deferred financing costs associated with the senior subordinated notes 
excluding these costs  interest decreased due to lower average interest rates in  partially offset by higher average outstanding borrowings 
the lower average borrowing rate in was due primarily to decreased rates on our revolving credit facility 
the increase in average borrowings in resulted primarily from higher working capital requirements 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for was 
primarily foreign and certain state income taxes were provided for in both years because federal income taxes were not owed due to the recognition of net operating loss carry forwards for which valuation allowances had been provided 
at december   our subsidiaries had million of net operating loss carry forwards for federal tax purposes 
we have not recognized any tax benefit for these loss carry forwards 
in accordance with the provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas recorded no tax benefit for the net loss because we had incurred three years of cumulative losses 
income taxes of 
million were provided in  primarily for state and foreign taxes on profitable operations 
liquidity and sources of capital our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our senior subordinated notes 
on july   we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a group of banks that provided for availability of up to million  subject to an asset based formula 
in september  we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the availability to million subject to an asset based formula 
in december  we further amended our revolving credit facility to increase the availability to million  subject to an asset based formula  as well as to extend the maturity from july  to december  the revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all our assets in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
borrowings from this revolving credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be borrowed at the company s election at either i libor plus 
to or ii the bank s prime lending rate 
the libor based interest rate is dependent on the company s debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  a detailed borrowing base formula provides borrowing availability to the company based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and approximately million of unused borrowing availability 
current financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet current cash requirements 
the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on the company s ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant  which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends 
failure to meet the debt service ratio could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings 
at december   the company was in compliance with the debt service ratio covenant and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  working capital increased by million to million at december  from million at december  major components of working capital  including accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets  trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  increased 
table of contents substantially during due primarily to significant revenue growth and the acquisition of ppg and lectrotherm 
during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the increase in cash provision of million was primarily the result of a much smaller increase in net operating assets  net of the impact of acquisitions  in compared to million compared to million  respectively  and an increase in net income of million 
approximately million of the increase in net income was due to noncash changes in deferred income taxes  partially offset by noncash restructuring and impairment charges 
during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures and million in acquisitions and borrowed an additional million under its revolving credit facilities 
during  the company provided million from operating activities as compared to providing million in the decrease of million was primarily the result of the increase in working capital  net of the impact of acquisitions  of million and the absence of non cash restructuring charges million in offset by the increase in net income of million 
during  the company also invested million in capital expenditures and million in an acquisition  generated million from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes and million from its revolving credit facility and used million to redeem the senior subordinated notes 
these activities resulted in an increase in cash of million for the year 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at december   none were outstanding 
we currently have no other derivative instruments 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and other commercial commitments over various future periods as of december  payments due or commitment expiration per period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations interest obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations postretirement obligations standby letters of credit total interest obligations are included on the senior subordinated notes due only and assume notes are paid at maturity 
the calculation of interest on debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other variable rate debt  based on average interest rate and outstanding borrowings of at december  is not included above due to the subjectivity and estimation required 
postretirement obligations include projected postretirement benefit payments to participants only through 
table of contents we expect that funds provided by operations plus available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize more than of our revenue when title is transferred to unaffiliated customers  typically upon shipment 
our remaining revenue  from long term contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
our policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectibility concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
writeoffs of accounts receivable have historically been low 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though we consider these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during   and  the company decided to exit certain under performing product lines and to close or consolidate certain operating facilities and  accordingly  recorded restructuring and impairment charges as discussed above and in note o to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
restructuring we recognize costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges for charges prior to detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated on a quarterly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in the estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the changes 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which nullified eitf and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at the fair value only when the liability is incurred 
fas has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to 
table of contents goodwill we adopted fas as of january  under fas  we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed the transitional impairment review of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the charge has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have also completed the annual impairment test as of october   and and have determined that no additional goodwill impairment existed as of those dates 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
in determining these amounts  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income and the extended period of time over which the postretirement benefits will be paid and accordingly records a tax valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized as required by fas at december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire between and pension and other postretirement benefit plans we and our subsidiaries have pension plans  principally noncontributory defined benefit or noncontributory defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trends 
pension plan asset performance in the future will directly impact our net income 
we have evaluated our pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions  considering current trends in interest rates and market conditions and believe our assumptions are appropriate 
stock based compensation we elected to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
compensation expense resulting from fixed awards of restricted shares was measured at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period 
an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation would have been the fair value method defined by fas fas permits use of the intrinsic value method and did not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
if compensation cost for stock options granted had been determined based on the fair value method of fas  our net income loss and diluted income loss per share would have been decreased increased by million

fas r was effective as of january  fas r is a revision of fas and supersedes apb the adoption of fair value recognition provisions for stock options is expected to increase the company s compensation expense by 
million before tax 
environmental we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third party sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state laws  which provide for strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability 
we are 
table of contents participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  our share of such costs has not been material and based on available information  our management does not expect our exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we have been named as one of many defendants in a number of asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
our cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and  based upon available information  our management does not expect our future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
we caution  however  that inherent in management s estimates of our exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors that may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results our results of operations are typically stronger in the first six months than the last six months of each calendar year due to scheduled plant maintenance in the third quarter to coincide with customer plant shutdowns and due to holidays in the fourth quarter 
the timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our business units 
such variability is particularly evident at the capital equipment businesses  included in the manufactured products segment  which typically ship a few large systems per year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our floating rate revolving credit facility  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  our foreign subsidiaries generally conduct business in local currencies 
during  we recorded a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment of 
million related to net assets located outside the united states 
this foreign currency translation adjustment resulted primarily from the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar 
our foreign operations are also subject to other customary risks of operating in a global environment  such as unstable political situations  the effect of local laws and taxes  tariff increases and regulations and requirements for export licenses  the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions and transportation delays 
our largest exposures to commodity prices relate to steel and natural gas price increases  which have increased significantly in we do not have any commodity swap agreements or hedge contracts for future increases in steel or natural gas prices
