item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
orthopaedic products industry according to a research report published by knowledge enterprises  inc in october  the worldwide market for orthopaedic products in was estimated to be billion  which represented an increase of from the previous year 
according to this study  the primary three market segments in which exactech offers its products and services  reconstructive devices  orthobiologics and other products which includes instrumentation and other orthopaedic products  were estimated to be billion  billion and billion  respectively  during according to this report  bone and joint diseases account for half of all the chronic conditions in people over fifty years of age 
with the prediction of this population of persons over fifty to double by the year  the report suggests that demographics alone will drive growth in the global orthopaedic marketplace 
management shares the belief that the industry will continue to grow due to an aging population in much of the world 
increasing life spans impact the number of individuals with joints subject to failure  thereby increasing demand for joint replacement procedures 
products exactech s joint replacement products are used by orthopaedic surgeons to repair or replace joints that have deteriorated as a result of injury or disease 
reconstructive joint surgery involves the modification of the area surrounding the affected joint and the insertion of a set of manufactured implant components to replace or augment the joint 
during the surgery  the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and a portion of the bones that comprise the joint  prepares the remaining bone surfaces and surrounding tissue and then installs the implant 
when necessary  the surgeon uses biologic allograft materials  like those services distributed by exactech  to repair bone defects and provide an environment to stimulate new bone growth 
in many joint replacement procedures  acrylic bone cement is used to affix implant components to the prepared bone surfaces 

table of contents the following table includes the net revenue and percentage of net revenue for each of exactech s product lines for the years ended december   and sales revenue by product line dollars in thousands year ended december  december  december  knee implants hip implants biologics other products total knee implants 
we believe that our optetrak knee system represents a major advance in knee implant design 
the optetrak knee system is a modular system designed to improve the movement of the knee cap  which is called patellar tracking  reduce the force between surfaces in a joint  also called articular contact stress  that leads to implant failure  and provide a functional range of motion 
the optetrak system provides for a variety of femoral components  which relate to the thighbone  or femur  region  and includes a total primary knee replacement system which is available with either a cruciate ligament sparing femoral component in both cemented and porous coated designs and used in situations where the surgeon chooses to maintain certain ligaments or a posterior stabilized femoral component in both cemented and porous coated designs and used in situations where the surgeon chooses to eliminate certain ligaments 
the optetrak system also includes a constrained total knee system for revision surgery and primary surgery with severe deformities 
the constrained version includes two types of femoral components the constrained condylar modular femoral component and a constrained non modular femoral component 
the modular component includes stem and block augmentation to aid in repairing damaged or weakened bone 
the constrained condylar femoral component was designed to provide greater constraint between the tibial and femoral components of the system to compensate for ligaments weakened or lost due to disease or as a result of failure of previous treatments 
during  we began full scale marketing of an asymmetrical femoral component product line extension to the optetrak system 
this line extension includes a cruciate sparing  posterior stabilized and a new high flexion line 
these asymmetrical line extensions will provide for differentiated right and left femoral components that we hope will be successful in meeting surgeon preferences 
during  we released a high flexion and rotating bearing versions of the optetrak system 
in  we plan to further expand the optetrak line with introduction of a unicondylar knee designed for cases where only one compartment of the knee is replaced  low profile instrumentation for reduced incision surgery and a rotating bearing knee system for international markets 
in march  we commenced distributing link s line of implant products which includes the link endo model tm rotational knee  designed to provide stability with controlled rotation for severe joint deterioration with insufficient ligament support and the link endo model tm sled uni knee  designed for cases where only a portion of a joint warrants replacement 
hip implants 
exactech s line of hip implant and instrument products includes the acumatch integrated hip system which is designed to address the majority of requirements for total hip replacement  including primary and revision needs 
the system includes the c series cemented femoral stem  the a series acetabular components for the hip socket  the p series press fit femoral stem  the m series modular femoral stem  the l series femoral stem system  bipolar and unipolar partial hip replacement components  a variety of femoral heads and a cemented acetabular component 
the acumatch cemented revision components include revision long stems and calcar replacement stems that were originally part of the aura revision hip system 
exactech s acumatch c series cemented femoral stem is a forged cobalt chromium stem designed to improve stability and reduce dislocation complications by improving the head neck ratio and restoring anatomic offset for patients requiring cemented total hip arthroplasty  or joint reconstructive surgery 
the acumatch a series was designed to provide a comprehensive acetabular offering with 
table of contents sufficient polyethylene thickness to help lower stresses in the polyethylene liner 
the acumatch m series modular femoral stem offers components that are interchangeable  allowing the surgeon to customize the prosthesis at the time of surgery and according to the patient s bony structures 
this versatility and the manner in which the components mate can have a positive effect on patient outcomes 
the acumatch p series press fit femoral stem system has multiple coating options for fixation to bone and features a scientifically sound solution to stiffness mismatch and rotational instability in the bone  potential underlying causes of post operative residual thigh pain 
the acumatch l series hip system features both cemented and press fit femoral components  as well as unipolar and bipolar endoprostheses  often used for the treatment of hip fractures 
a low profile instrumentation system was launched during to support cases in which the surgeon may choose a smaller incision length 
the link hip implant product lines distributed by exactech include the mp tm modular femoral revision stem  offering surgeons a product specifically designed and required for situations where there is deficient proximal bone the top quarter of the femur 
this unique design offers enhanced stability and fatigue strength over and above competitive stems indicated for similar clinical situations 
also distributed by exactech is the link saddle prosthesis  a salvage type prosthesis designed to support the pelvic region when the acetabulum cannot be reconstructed  the link spii hip stem  and the link partial pelvis 
during  we introduced the press fit version of the new novation hip system as well as connexion gxl enhanced polyethelene for the acumatch a series acetabular system  which we feel will make our hip offerings more competitive 
the novation hip system will ultimately feature cemented primary femoral stems  and a comprehensive acetabular system which is being designed to incorporate the use of enhanced polyethylene as well as alternative bearing couples such as ceramic on ceramic and diamond on diamond 
exactech submitted its ceramic on ceramic design for pma approval to the food and drug administration fda in the fourth quarter of and is hoping to receive approval in late or early exactech continues to develop the diamond on diamond technology in cooperation with diamicron  corporation 
biologics 
prior to december  exactech exclusively distributed worldwide bone paste materials processed by rti for use in non spinal musculoskeletal orthopaedic procedures 
during december  rti and exactech and rti and medtronic sofamor danek  inc modified their agreements providing for each organization to market the services for all musculoskeletal procedures 
these unique allograft materials are distributed as opteform and optefil and are clinically proven for effectively repairing bone and filling bone defects 
during  exactech expanded the breadth of its allograft materials line in cooperation with rti by releasing the optefil rt line and released an opteform rt line during these room temperature  or rt  lines are allograft materials that are distributed in a non frozen form 
exactech also distributes regenaform and regenafil allograft tissue implants for usage in oral and dental applications 
in october  rti announced a voluntary recall of some of its allograft tissue implants due to questions raised with respect to donor documentation on donated tissues received from an unaffiliated donor recovery organization 
this recall affected some of the allograft tissue services distributed by exactech 
the ultimate effect of this recall on exactech s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows is uncertain 
in march  exactech received clearance from the fda to market a new demineralized bone matrix  or dbm  based human allograft material 
we released this material to market in early optecure tm includes a synthetic bioabsorbable polymer carrier technology  licensed from genzyme corp 
exactech is currently developing variations of this material to expand the product line 
also during  exactech commenced marketing of optemx tm a tri calcium phosphate hydoxyapatite based synthetic bone graft extender licensed under a non exclusive us distribution agreement with biomatlante 
other products 
the acudriver automated osteotome system is an air driven impact hand piece that assists surgeons during joint implant revision procedures by aiding in effective removal of failed prostheses and bone cement 
the acudriver accomplishes this by providing the surgeon with precise positioning without the inconvenience and inconsistency of striking the osteotome with a mallet 
exactech also distributes link surgical instrumentation that can be used in various orthopaedic procedures including shoulder  knee  spine  foot  ankle and hip arthroplasty 

table of contents the cemex bone cement system features a unique self contained delivery system that has been clinically proven in europe for more than a decade 
by integrating bone cement powder and liquid into a sealed mixing system  cemex is designed to offer surgeons and operating room personnel simplicity  safety and reliability in bone cement 
exactech distributes cemex in the united states under an exclusive distribution agreement with the italian manufacturer  tecres spa in june  exactech gained fda clearance and began marketing cemex genta  a bone cement containing antibiotics 
in exactech announced that tecres had received clearance from the fda to market pre formed cement hip and knee spacer products containing an antibiotic that is included in our distribution agreement 
the interspace tm hip and knee spacers are used in two stage revision procedures involving an infection with a previously implanted prosthesis and provides orthopaedic surgeons with a new  convenient way to treat this difficult problem 
we began marketing the spacers in in  exactech acquired rights to a patented total shoulder system from teknimed  sa teknimed  a french manufacturer of orthopaedic implants and processor of biological products 
teknimed continued to manufacture and distribute the shoulder system in europe for the company while exactech established appropriate manufacturing support and upgraded the design 
in november  we received fda clearance for marketing the equinoxe tm primary and fracture shoulder systems in the united states 
during  we commenced full scale marketing of the primary and fracture systems 
marketing and sales exactech markets its orthopaedic implant products in the united states through fifty independent sales agencies and one domestic distributor 
these agencies  along with their independently contracted personnel  serve as the company s sales representatives 
internationally  exactech markets its products through twenty five distributors that currently distribute products in twenty seven countries 
the customers for exactech s products are hospitals  surgeons and other physicians and clinics 
exactech generally has contractual arrangements with its independent sales agencies whereby the agency is granted the exclusive right to sell the company s products in the specified territory 
in turn  the agency is required to meet sales quotas to maintain its relationship with exactech 
we typically pay our sales agencies a commission based on net sales 
exactech is highly dependent on the expertise and customer relationships of its sales agencies 
exactech s sales organization is managed by six regional directors of sales assigned to the east  central  midwest  southeast  southwest and west regions 
we have a contractual arrangement with our domestic distributor that is similar to our arrangements with our sales agencies  except we do not pay the distributor commissions and the distributor purchases inventory from the company for use in fulfilling customer orders 
exactech currently offers its products in all fifty states  and the district of columbia 
exactech provides inventories of its products to its united states sales agencies until sold or returned 
these inventories are necessary for sales agents to market the company s products and fill customer orders 
the size of the component to be used for a specific patient is typically not known with certainty until the time of surgery 
due to this uncertainty  a minimum of one of each size of each component in the system to be used must be available to each sales agency at the time of surgery 
accordingly  exactech is required to maintain substantial levels of inventory 
the maintenance of relatively high levels of inventory requires us to incur significant expenditures of our resources 
the failure by exactech to maintain required levels of inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company s expansion 
as a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory  exactech is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in the event that a substantial portion of the company s inventory becomes obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on the company 
we review our inventory for obsolescence on a regular basis and adjust our inventory for impairment 
during each of the years ended december   and  approximately of our sales were derived from a major hospital customer 
during   and  one international distributor accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of exactech s total sales revenue 
exactech generally has contractual arrangements with its international distributors pursuant to which the distributor is granted the exclusive right to market our products in the specified territory and the distributor is required to meet sales quotas to maintain its relationship with us 
international distributors typically purchase product inventory and instruments from us for their use in marketing and filling customer orders 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  international sales accounted for   and  respectively  representing approximately  and  respectively  of exactech s sales 
of those international sales  sales to our spanish distributor accounted for   and  in  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to expand our sales in international markets in which there is increasing demand for orthopaedic implant products 
manufacturing and supply early in our history  exactech utilized third party vendors for the manufacture of all of our component parts  while internally performing product design  quality assurance and packaging 
at present  we manufacture approximately of our components in our manufacturing facility and headquarters in gainesville  florida 
we have continued to increase the number of internally manufactured components 
with the increase of internal manufacturing  we have experienced a greater degree of control of production costs  and we expect this trend to continue 
exactech continually assesses the manufacturing capabilities and cost effectiveness of our existing and potential vendors in an attempt to secure our supply chain and decrease dependency on key suppliers 
for the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately  and  respectively  of our externally sourced component requirements from our top three suppliers 
we typically do not maintain supply contracts with most of our manufacturers  and purchase components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
during the first half of  we experienced challenges with our supply chain that adversely impacted our ability to meet complete demand for some of our new and existing hip and knee implant products  however  we believe we have made significant progress in working with our suppliers to resolve those issues  both in the short and long term 
exactech has developed alternative sources for components 
while we do not anticipate that we will encounter problems in obtaining adequate supplies of components  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain components under acceptable terms and in a timely manner 
certain tooling and equipment unique to exactech s products are provided by us to our suppliers 
order backlog is not a material aspect of our business 
exactech s internal manufacturing  assembly  packaging and quality control operations are conducted at our principal offices in gainesville  florida 
components received from suppliers  as well as those internally manufactured  are examined by exactech personnel prior to assembly or packaging to ensure that our specifications and standards are maintained 
patents and proprietary technology  license and consulting agreements exactech holds united states and international patents covering several of our implant components  biologic materials technologies and some of our surgical instrumentation 
we believe that patents and intellectual property will continue to be important in the orthopaedic industry 
in this regard  we defend our intellectual property rights and believe that our patents and products do not and will not infringe patents or violate proprietary rights of others  although it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur 
in the event some of exactech s intellectual property and agreements relating to our products are deemed invalid  such action could have a material adverse effect on exactech s financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with the development of our knee implant systems  exactech pays royalties to dr 
william petty and dr 
gary miller  who are executive officers and principal shareholders of the company 
dr 
petty also serves as chairman of the company s board of directors 
new employment agreements entered into between exactech and each of drs 
petty and miller on january  provide for the continuation of the royalty payments in addition to their regular compensation as executive officers 
compensation associated with these agreements is the only compensation paid by exactech to drs 
petty and miller 
exactech has entered into a verbal consulting agreement with albert burstein  phd  a director of the company  to provide services regarding many facets of the orthopaedic industry including product design rationale  manufacturing and development techniques and product sales and marketing 
during  exactech paid dr 
burstein  as compensation under this consulting agreement 

table of contents research and development during  and  exactech expended   and  respectively  on research and development and anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase 
exactech s research and development efforts contributed to the successful integration of the acumatch hip systems  line extensions of the optetrak knee system and design improvements targeted to improving internal manufacturing efficiency 
exactech s research and development efforts continue to focus on implant product line extensions  advanced biologic materials  extremity joint reconstruction and alternative bearing surfaces 
as an important part of our research and development efforts  we have developed strategic partnerships through agreements with genzyme biosurgery and diamicron corporation to bring expertise in advanced materials to exactech s products 
the agreement with genzyme is for the development of polymer based synthetic biomaterials that when delivered with other biologic products support the growth of new bone 
through our agreement with diamicron  we intend to apply diamicron s polycrystalline diamond compact  or pdc  technology to our hip implants 
this diamond technology holds the promise of improved mechanical and wear characteristics over currently available technology 
this technology will likely require a number of years of development and regulatory clearance prior to the release of products for sale 
exactech believes that the purchase of intellectual property and product line assets augmented by additional development provides a cost effective and efficient way to bring products to market and expects to continue to do so in the future to complement its internal product development 
competition the orthopaedic industry is highly competitive and dominated by a number of large companies with substantially greater financial and other resources than exactech 
the largest competitors in the orthopaedic market are depuy  inc  a division of johnson and johnson  zimmer  inc  a subsidiary of zimmer holdings  inc  stryker howmedica osteonics  a subsidiary of stryker corp  smith and nephew plc  and biomet orthopaedics  a subsidiary of biomet  inc these five companies  according to a report by knowledge enterprises  inc  the worldwide orthopedic market  had an estimated aggregate market share of approximately in companies in the industry compete on the basis of product features and design  innovation  service  the ability to maintain new product flow  relationships with key orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals  the strength of their distribution network and price 
while price is a key factor in the orthopaedic market  there are other significant factors  including surgeon preference  ease of use  clinical results  and service provided by the company and its representatives 
product liability and insurance exactech is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  marketing and sale of orthopaedic implants and surgical instrumentation 
we have implemented strict quality control measures and currently maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are typical in the industry for similar companies 
during through  we experienced stable insurance premiums  as a percentage of sales 
we evaluate annually our levels of product liability insurance  as well as the amount of retention carried compared to other companies in the industry 
due to the volatility of the insurance marketplace  the value of the product liability insurance products delivered and the small number of providers of these products  there can be no guarantees as to whether we will be able to secure such coverage in the future at a cost deemed to be appropriate 
government regulation exactech is subject to government regulation in the united states and other countries in which it conducts business 
for some products  and in some areas of the world  government regulation is significant  and there appears to be a general trend toward more stringent regulation throughout the world 
governmental regulatory actions can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls or seizures of product  total or partial suspensions of production  refusals to grant future 
table of contents pre market clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals  and criminal prosecution 
it is exactech s practice to comply with all regulatory requirements governing its products and operations and to conduct its affairs in an ethical manner 
exactech devotes significant time  effort and expense addressing the extensive government and regulatory requirements applicable to its business and believes that it is no more or less adversely affected by existing government regulations than are its competitors 
the primary regulatory authority in the united states is the fda 
the development  testing  marketing and manufacturing of medical devices  including reconstructive devices  are regulated under the medical device amendments of to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the safe medical devices act of  the fda modernization act of  the medical device user fee and modernization act of and additional regulations promulgated by the fda and various other federal  state and local agencies 
in general  these statutes and regulations require that manufacturers adhere to certain standards designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices 
the fda is authorized to obtain and inspect devices  their labeling and advertising  and the facilities in which they are manufactured 
exactech is registered with the fda and believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable material governmental regulations 
exactech believes it is well positioned to face the changing international regulatory environment 
the international standards organization  or iso  has an internationally recognized set of standards aimed at ensuring the design and manufacture of quality products 
exactech has successfully participated in iso audits and obtained iso registration 
the european union requires that medical devices bear a ce mark 
the ce mark is an international symbol  which indicates that the product adheres to european medical device directives 
each of exactech s medical devices sold in europe bears the ce mark 
exactech is subject to federal anti kickback laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration  either directly or indirectly  in return for  or to induce referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or another government sponsored health care program  or purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for  or recommending the purchase  lease or order of  any service or product for which payment may be made by a government sponsored health care program 
violation of these laws is a felony  punishable by fines up to  per violation and imprisonment for up to five years 
civil penalties may also be imposed which exclude violators from participation in medicare or state health programs 
regulators may challenge or review exactech s current or future activities under these laws which would be costly and time consuming and could reduce cash flows and revenues 
significant prohibitions against physician referrals were enacted by congress in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of these laws prohibit  subject to specified exemptions  a physician or a member of his immediate family from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing designated health services in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest  or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement 
the penalties for violating these laws include a prohibition on payment by these government programs and civil penalties of as much as  for each violative referral and  for participation in a circumvention scheme 
the violation of these laws by the company could result in significant fines or penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
while exactech is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be affected by future regulatory developments  it believes that its substantial experience in dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions throughout the world should enable it to continue to compete effectively within this increasingly regulated environment 
environmental law compliance exactech s operations are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
environmental permits and controls are required for some of exactech s manufacturing operations and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities 
exactech does not have underground storage tanks and believes that its facilities are in substantial compliance with its permits and environmental laws and regulations and does not believe 
table of contents that future environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
exactech s environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or as a result of increased manufacturing activities at its facilities 
exactech could be materially adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws  including the costs of undertaking a clean up at a site to which its wastes were transported 
employees as of december   exactech employed full time employees 
exactech has no union contracts and believes that its relationship with employees is good

royalty expenses consist primarily of expenditures made to the owners of patents and contributing surgeons who have licensed the use of their inventions or contributed their professional expertise to exactech for our product development and manufacturing uses 
knee implant products generally carry a higher royalty charge than other implant products  however  new implant product line technologies are expected to be subject to royalty charges as they are introduced 
in marketing its products  exactech uses a combination of traditional targeted media marketing and our primary marketing focus  direct customer contact and service to orthopaedic surgeons 
since surgeons are the primary decision maker when it comes to the choice of products and services that best meet the needs of their patients  our marketing strategy is focused on developing relationships and meeting the needs of the surgeon community in the orthopaedic industry 
in cooperation with our organization of independent sales agencies in the united states and network of independent distributors and subsidiaries internationally  exactech conducts this effort through continuing education forums  training programs and product development advisory panels

as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses were in  as compared to in in  sales and marketing expenses increased from  primarily as a result of increases in variable selling costs associated with sales growth  such as commissions paid to our independent agents  however  the increases in the variable costs were offset by a reduction in special marketing events of as we did not host a large  worldwide surgeons conference in as we did in we expect that sales and marketing expenses in will continue to be similar to those we experienced in on a percentage of sales basis as we will continue our marketing programs in support of new product launches and customer service 
general and administrative expenses increased in from primarily due to increases in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts and product liability insurance costs 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased  during the year primarily due to the filing of a reorganization plan under bankruptcy protection by one of our hospital accounts 
in  we did not experience any bad debt expense as a result of a bankruptcy of any of our customer accounts

income from operations income from operations decreased in from  as growth in operating expenses outpaced growth in top line sales revenue

the series c stock  of altiva  a newly created class of altiva s capital stock of which exactech is the only holder  at exactech s election any time between october  and october  the conversion ratio of the loans is structured such that if exactech loans the full million commitment  the conversion of all outstanding balances under the loans combined with shares of series c stock exactech received in connection with its original investment  will give exactech a interest in altiva 
if less than a million amount of principal is outstanding under the loan at the time exactech elects to convert  the number of shares issued is subject to a proportionate adjustment 
the series c stock to be issued to exactech upon conversion of the loan is held solely by exactech and has identical rights and privileges to the common stock of altiva except that the series c stock has a superior liquidation preference with respect to dividends and upon liquidation of altiva up to the extent of exactech s investment in altiva and is convertible on a for basis into shares of altiva s common stock

table of contents exactech has evaluated its investment in altiva corporation at december  in accordance with the provisions of fin r  and based upon this analysis  it is management s opinion that altiva does not qualify as a variable interest entity requiring consolidation 
we will conduct an analysis of our investment in altiva each interim period to determine if the fair value of the equity investment  guarantee of a line of credit and commitment to fund convertible debt constitutes more than of the fair value of altiva s total equity  subordinated debt and other forms of subordinated financial support  thus requiring consolidation under fin r

should interest rates vary significantly  our estimate could be materially different from actual results in at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on exactech and our subsidiaries financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
exactech s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in management s opinion  exactech s critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  intangible assets  subsidiary consolidation and accrued liabilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts exactech s accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from hospitals 
amounts due from international distributors carry longer payment terms than domestic customers  typically due in days 
we typically perform credit evaluations on our customers and generally do not require collateral 
exactech invoices sales to international distributors in us dollars and is not subject to currency exchange rate risk on accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to estimate the losses due to the inability to collect required payment from our customers for products and services rendered 
in calculating the allowance  we utilize a model that ages the accounts receivable and applies a progressively higher allowance percentage to each tier of receivables past due terms 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required which would affect exactech s future operating results due to increased expenses for the resulting uncollectible bad debt 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include implants consigned to customers and agents 
exactech provides significant loaned implant inventory to non distributor customers 
impairment charges for obsolete and slow moving inventories are recorded based upon an analysis of specific identification of obsolete inventory items and quantification of slow moving inventory items 
for slow moving inventory  this analysis compares the quantity of inventory on hand to the annual sales of such inventory items 
as a result of this analysis  we record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of any impaired inventory to its fair value  which becomes its new cost basis 
impairment charges for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
if the actual product life cycles  demand or general market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory impairment charges may be required which would affect future operating results due to increased costs from the resulting adjustment 
intangible assets in assessing the value of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows  economic life and other factors to determine fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge for these assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
exactech analyzes its intangible assets for impairment issues on a quarterly and annual basis 
subsidiary consolidation in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 exactech evaluates its equity investments on a quarterly basis to determine the necessity to consolidate the investment as a subsidiary of the company 
our wholly owned subsidiaries  exactech asia  ltd 
and exactech uk  ltd 
are fully consolidated after all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
accrued liabilities exactech is subject to various claims  lawsuits  disputes with third parties and actions involving various allegations against exactech incident to the operation of its business  principally product liability claims 
exactech accrues liabilities for such claims that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable  as required by sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  based upon exactech s experience with similar past claims  advice of counsel and the best information available 
if one or both of these criteria are not met  exactech discloses the loss contingency if it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred  in accordance with sfas no 
should the outcome of any pending  threatened  or future litigation have an outcome unfavorable to exactech  it may affect future operating results due to the resulting increases in operating expenses associated with such litigation
