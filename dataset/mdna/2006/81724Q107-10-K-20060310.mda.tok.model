part i item business overview we are a leading company focused on using proprietary taste receptor based assays and screening technologies to discover and develop novel flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators for the packaged food and beverage industry 
we believe our flavor ingredients will enable packaged food and beverage companies to improve the nutritional profile of their products while maintaining or enhancing taste and may generate cost of goods savings 
we license our flavor ingredients to our collaborators on an exclusive or co exclusive basis  which we believe we will provide these companies with the ability to differentiate their products 
we have entered into product discovery and development collaborations with five of the world s leading packaged food and beverage companies cadbury schweppes  campbell soup company  the coca cola company  kraft foods global  inc and nestl sa 
we currently anticipate that we will derive all of our revenues from existing and future collaborations 
depending upon the collaboration  our existing collaboration agreements provide for upfront fees  research and development funding  reimbursement of certain regulatory costs  milestone payments based upon our achievement of research or development goals and  in the event of commercialization  royalties on future sales of consumer products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
our current programs focus on the development of savory  sweet and salt flavor enhancers and bitter taste modulators 
flavors are substances that impart tastes or aromas in foods and beverages 
individuals experience the sensation of taste when flavors in food and beverage products interact with taste receptors in the mouth 
a taste receptor functions either by physically binding to a flavor ingredient in a process analogous to the way a key fits into a lock or by acting as a channel to allow ions to flow directly into a taste cell 
as a result of these interactions  signals are sent to the brain where a specific taste sensation is registered 
there are currently five recognized primary senses of taste umami  which is the savory taste of glutamate  sweet  salt  bitter and sour 
we are currently pursuing savory  sweet and salt flavor enhancer and bitter taste modulator discovery and development programs 
the goals of our savory program are to enhance the taste of naturally occurring glutamate and enable the reduction or elimination of added monosodium glutamate  or msg 
the goals of our sweet program are to enhance the taste of natural and artificial sweeteners and enable a significant reduction in added sweeteners 
the goals of our salt program are to enhance the taste of salt and enable a significant reduction in added salt 
the goals of our bitter taste modulation program are to reduce or block bitter taste and improve the overall taste characteristics of packaged foods  beverages  over the counter or otc health care products and pharmaceutical products

industry background packaged food and beverage industry packaged food and beverage products include carbonated and non carbonated beverages  frozen foods  snack foods  ice cream  pasta  canned soup and numerous other products 
according to recent data from euromonitor international  an independent research organization  worldwide sales of packaged food and beverage products in were approximately trillion  of which billion was generated in the united states 
these figures represent growth rates of approximately and  respectively  over amounts 
based on these estimates  of the worldwide total  sales of packaged foods were approximately trillion and sales of non alcoholic beverages were approximately billion 
based on recent data from euromonitor  information resources  inc and our collaborators annual reports  we estimate that our collaborators combined worldwide sales in of their products that fall within their exclusive product fields were over billion 
our collaboration agreements provide that we will receive royalties of up to on our collaborators sales of products containing our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
however  we do not anticipate that our collaborators will incorporate our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators into all of their products within their exclusive product fields 
each of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators addresses large  potentially overlapping markets 
the following table sets forth the four primary taste areas on which we are focused and  for each taste area  provides examples of product categories that could incorporate ingredients in those taste areas  estimated worldwide sales and our estimates of the worldwide sales for food and beverage products of our existing collaborators in their exclusive or co exclusive product fields 
taste areas example product categories estimated worldwide sales estimated revenues of existing collaborators in exclusive product fields savory ready meals  sauces  spreads  frozen foods  beverages  meal replacements  soups  pastas  dried foods  snack foods  processed meats  processed cheeses and cracker products billion billion sweet confectionaries  cereal  ice cream  beverages  yogurt  dessert  spreads and bakery products billion billion salt product categories are the same as those set forth for savory taste area plus canned foods and bakery products billion billion bitter products which contain bitter tastants  including confectionary  beverages  ice cream  ready meals  canned foods and soups  and products which utilize certain artificial sweeteners billion billion according to recent euromonitor data for packaged food and beverages  excluding pharmaceutical and otc health care applications 
based on recent data from euromonitor  information resources  inc and our collaborators annual reports 
flavor industry flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators are used in a variety of packaged food and beverage products throughout the world 
flavors are substances that impart tastes or aromas in foods or beverages 
flavor enhancers and taste modulators are substances that supplement  enhance or modify the original flavor or aroma of foods  without necessarily imparting noticeable flavors or aromas 
flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators can originate from either naturally occurring or chemically synthesized compounds 
while some packaged food and beverage companies have their own internal research and development programs  most have traditionally relied on purchases of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators from third parties 
historically  flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators have been sold on a commodity basis by independent manufacturers who make their products broadly available to packaged food and beverage companies on a non exclusive basis 
this has limited the ability of packaged food and beverage companies to use flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators to differentiate their brands from competitors 
traditionally  flavor companies have discovered new flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators primarily using inefficient  non automated and labor intensive trial and error processes involving a limited number of trained taste testers 
using this approach  taste testers must physically taste each potential flavor and flavor enhancer compound to assess the taste characteristics of the compound 
taste testers can assess only a limited number of potential flavors or flavor enhancers at one time due to the sensory fatigue that results from repeated tasting 
as a result  only a small fraction of the available universe of compounds can be tested economically 
in the united states  most flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators are regulated as generally recognized as safe  or gras  substances under the provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or fd c act 
gras determinations for most new flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators are made by an independent panel of scientists administered by the flavor and extract manufacturers association  or fema 
four compounds developed as part of our savory program have received fema gras determination 
the process from selection for development until receipt of that determination took approximately months 
costs associated with the fema gras process  including synthesis of material for regulatory studies  contract safety studies and preparation of the application  were less than million 
we expect that future flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators we develop will take a similar amount of time and cost a similar amount 
however  the length of time may vary depending on the properties of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator 
once a flavor or flavor enhancer is determined to be fema gras  it may be immediately incorporated into products for test marketing and commercialization in the united states and in other countries 
flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators as a source of competitive advantage the packaged food and beverage industry is comprised of a number of large and highly competitive market segments 
small market share gains in specific large market segments can translate into significant additional revenue for packaged food and beverage companies 
for example  according to recent euromonitor data  estimated worldwide sales of soft drinks were approximately billion 
thus  an increase of a tenth of a percentage point in overall worldwide market share would result in additional revenue of approximately million 
as a result of these market opportunities  packaged food and beverage companies are constantly seeking ways to differentiate their products  demand for which can be greatly affected by very small actual or perceived improvements in flavor or health profiles 
flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators can potentially provide an important way to differentiate a particular product through enhanced taste  improvements in nutritional profile or labeling  flavor ingredient exclusivity and cost of goods savings 
taste 
product taste is a critical competitive factor for packaged food and beverage companies 
these companies seek to use flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators to improve or maintain taste while improving the nutritional profile of packaged food and beverage products or reducing ingredient costs 
health benefits 
packaged food and beverage companies are exploring ways to improve overall nutritional quality of their products 
it is widely accepted that poor diet contributes to adverse health conditions such as cardiovascular disease  diabetes and obesity 
to address these concerns  many companies have introduced reduced calorie  reduced sodium and reduced fat content products to the market 
flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators with specific desired characteristics provide an innovative way to reduce the levels of ingredients that may contribute to these concerns without compromising desirable taste attributes 
flavor ingredient exclusivity 
failure of packaged food and beverage companies to differentiate their brands from their competition  including private label products  may result in significant loss of market share  price pressure and erosion of profit margins 
packaged food and beverage companies spend millions of dollars creating brands and brand images to compete with other products 
many of these competitive products contain the same or similar flavor ingredients 
the limited availability of proprietary flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators makes it difficult for manufacturers to differentiate their products based on flavor ingredients 
cost of goods savings 
the packaged food and beverage industry purchases enormous volumes of raw materials to produce their products 
according to the food and agriculture division of the united nations  estimated worldwide sugar production in was approximately million metric tons  and consumption was over million metric tons 
given such high demand for sugar  spot prices for processed sugar rose over from february to february such that the market value of processed sugar produced worldwide during that period exceeded billion  based on us spot prices in february similarly  according to the chemical economics handbook  worldwide consumption of msg was nearly million metric tons in at a cost of billion 
flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators can potentially facilitate a reduction in the volume of these ingredients used in packaged food and beverage products  which could result in significant decreases in costs and associated increases in profit margins 
our solution we use our proprietary taste receptor based assays and screening technologies to discover and develop novel flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we have developed proprietary taste receptor based assays that incorporate human taste receptors 
we use these assays in our high throughput screening systems to rapidly and efficiently screen our compound libraries and identify large numbers of novel potential flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we believe our approach improves the likelihood that compounds with the desired characteristics can be discovered and then optimized into novel flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
we believe our approach will result in the discovery and development of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators that will provide the following valuable solutions to the following key challenges faced by the packaged food and beverage industry maintaining and improving taste 
we are developing flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators to enable our collaborators to improve or maintain taste while improving the nutritional profile of packaged food and beverage products or reducing ingredient costs 
reducing sugar  salt and msg in packaged food and beverage products 
we are developing flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators to enable our collaborators to significantly reduce the levels of sugar  salt and msg in packaged food and beverage products while maintaining or improving taste 
we believe reducing the levels of such ingredients will improve the nutritional profile of packaged food and beverage products 
blocking undesirable tastes 
we are discovering taste modulators that we believe will be useful in blocking bitter and other unwanted tastes associated with certain packaged food  beverage  otc health care products and pharmaceutical products 
obtaining exclusive or co exclusive use of proprietary flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we are able to offer our collaborators exclusive or co exclusive use of our proprietary flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators in defined packaged food and beverage product categories 
we believe this approach will assist our collaborators in differentiating their products from those of their competitors 
reducing cost of goods 
we believe our proprietary flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators will enable our collaborators to reduce overall raw material ingredient costs  particularly for those products containing high levels of natural and artificial sweeteners and msg 
our strategy our goal is to become the leader in discovering  developing and commercializing new and improved flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
key elements of our strategy include collaborating with leading packaged food and beverage companies 
we are collaborating with leading packaged food and beverage companies to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
our collaborators are responsible for marketing  selling and distributing their products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators that are incorporated into their products 
in addition  our collaborators are responsible for all manufacturing costs of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
as a result  we expect to commercialize our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators without incurring significant sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution costs 
we currently have collaborations with cadbury schweppes  campbell soup  coca cola  kraft foods and nestl 
developing flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators that are eligible for fema gras determination 
our primary focus is on the development of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators that will qualify for a fema gras determination 
four compounds developed as part of our savory program have received fema gras determination 
the process from selection for development until receipt of that determination took approximately months 
costs associated with the fema gras process  including synthesis of material for regulatory studies  contract safety studies and preparation of the application  were less than million 
we expect that future flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators we develop will take a similar amount of time and cost a similar amount 
however  the length of time may vary depending on the properties of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator 
upon the gras determination  our collaborators can begin to test market and commercialize products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
in the event that a particular flavor enhancer or taste modulator is not eligible for fema gras determination  we may dedicate our development efforts to alternative compounds 
pursuing additional collaborations and market opportunities 
we seek to establish additional collaborations with leading packaged food and beverage companies to use flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators developed through our existing programs for exclusive or co exclusive use within new packaged food and beverage product fields 
we intend to receive from future collaborators up front fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products incorporating these flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
in addition  we plan to target fields in which our collaborators can incorporate more than one of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators into a particular product 
expanding our product candidate pipeline 
we will continue to focus on the discovery and development of additional flavor ingredients based on additional taste receptors to address new taste areas 
we believe potential new taste receptors include the fat taste and cold taste receptors 
we also intend to improve the beneficial characteristics of our current product candidates through the development of next generation flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we will also continue to consider applications of our current products and technologies outside of the packaged food and beverage industry 
maintaining and expanding our technology position 
we believe our proprietary taste receptor based technologies  including our receptor discovery  assay development and high throughput screening technologies and natural and synthetic compound libraries  provide us and our collaborators with significant competitive advantages 
we intend to continue to develop and acquire proprietary technologies and related intellectual property rights to expand and enhance our ability to discover and develop new proprietary flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
our discovery and development process the following diagram summarizes our discovery and development process 

gbaijpg 
the key elements of our discovery and development process are proprietary taste receptor based assay development 
the first step in our discovery and development process is to develop proprietary assays based on human taste receptors 
our assays are tests that measure interactions between the taste receptors and potential flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
to date we have developed assays to test for compounds that affect savory  sweet and salt taste 
we are in the process of developing an assay for bitter taste receptors 
high throughput screening and identification of lead compounds 
the next step in our discovery and development process is to use our proprietary taste receptor based assays to identify compounds that bind to human taste receptors  known as hits 
we use automated high throughput screening to rapidly evaluate our libraries of diverse synthetic and natural compounds 
a panel of taste testers then evaluates the taste effect of the most potent hits 
based on this evaluation  we designate hits that exhibit a positive taste effect as proof of concept compounds 
we then select the most promising of those proof of concept compounds  which we call lead compounds  for optimization 
optimization of lead compounds and selection of product candidates 
the next step in our discovery and development process is to chemically enhance  or optimize  our lead compounds to allow lower amounts of the compound to be used in the finished product or improve the enhancement effect to meet the taste attribute goals of our collaborators 
optimization may also be required to enhance the safety profile or to improve the physical properties of a compound so that it is stable under manufacturing  storage and food preparation conditions 
we refer to optimized compounds that provide desirable taste attributes in packaged food and beverage product prototypes as product candidates 
safety studies and fema gras determination of product candidates 
the next step in our discovery and development process is to select  in conjunction with our collaborators  one or more product candidates for commercialization 
we then evaluate the selected product candidate for safety 
following this evaluation  we submit the safety data along with the physical and chemical properties of the product candidate and a description of manufacturing and conditions of intended use to the fema gras expert panel for review 
four compounds developed as part of our savory program have received fema gras determination 
the process from selection for development until receipt of that determination took approximately months 
costs associated with the fema gras process  including synthesis of material for regulatory studies  contract safety studies and preparation of the application  were less than million 
we expect that future flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators we develop will take a similar amount of time and cost a similar amount 
however  the length of time may vary depending on the properties of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator 
following a fema gras determination  foods and beverages containing our proprietary flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators can be immediately commercialized in the united states and other countries 
we intend to use the data from the fema gras review to facilitate approval of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators for use in products sold in additional countries 
we anticipate  however  that our collaborators will test market their products containing our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators through a series of consumer acceptance tests prior to initiating any wide scale commercialization 
our discovery and development programs we are currently pursuing the discovery and development of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators through programs focused on savory  sweet  salt and bitter 
savory enhancer program using savoryscreenht  our high throughput savory receptor based assay system  we identified two product candidates  s and s  that enhance the savory taste of glutamate 
our collaborator evaluated s and s for savory taste enhancement in product prototypes 
s is approximately three times more potent than s in taste tests and exhibits greater water solubility compared to s other characteristics  such as heat stability  are similar for the two compounds 
based on the results of such studies  our collaborator formally selected both s and s for development in may we completed the safety assessment studies for s and s and submitted applications for gras determination to the fema expert panel in december in march  s and s were determined to be gras 
in addition  two other flavor enhancers  s and s  which are related to s  were also determined by fema to be gras 
a more detailed description of the fema gras process is provided in item i  business regulatory process 
with our having achieved fema gras status for the four savory compounds  our collaborator initiated product development efforts to identify initial applications  optimal concentrations and the development of new recipes 
application work and taste testing is being conducted at multiple product development sites 
this work is expected to be completed no later than the end of september in parallel to this effort  we are conducting additional application and product development work both in house and in collaboration with a number of consultants and potential partners 
sweet enhancer program using sweetscreenht  our high throughput sweet receptor based assay system  we identified s and s  proof of concept compounds 
optimization chemistry led to the identification of s  which in taste tests was found to be approximately three times more potent than s and s we believe that the compounds we are developing in our sweet enhancer program will function with both carbohydrate and artificial sweeteners used in a variety of packaged food and beverage products and may provide for a significant reduction in added sweetener in the finished product while maintaining or improving the desired sweet taste 
during  we identified a number of novel compounds using our optimization chemistry process 
one compound  s  demonstrated enhanced potency in the receptor assay and in preliminary taste tests over the previous lead compound s at a concentration of approximately parts per million in a solution of fructose  s tastes as sweet as a fructose solution 
this is equivalent to a reduction of the added carbohydrate sweetener 
s was also effective in more complex product prototypes such as ice cream and cereal  but required approximately parts per million to significantly reduce the carbohydrate sweetener and maintain the sweet taste 
during the fourth quarter of  we created derivatives of s and other compounds to reduce the amounts needed in products and to optimize physical properties such as solubility in food and beverages 
recently  we identified s  a compound that is approximately as potent as s in taste tests  but is significantly more water soluble than s we expect such improvements in physical properties to improve functionality in products 
it is our goal to identify a sweet product candidate and initiate development and safety studies by the end of the third quarter of  and to achieve the first commercial sale of a product containing an ingredient from the sweet program in salt enhancer program the goal of our salt enhancer program is to identify compounds that enhance the taste of salt and provide a significant reduction in sodium levels in a variety of foods while maintaining or improving the desired salt taste 
we are continuing to identify enhancers of the ion channel  enac  the most potent of which is s in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we completed characterization of a second form of enac in taste cells  termed delta enac  which may also play a role in salt taste but has different properties from alpha enac  the form we had been studying previously 
based on our new findings  we have initiated discovery of delta enac enhancers and have isolated a set of active compounds using our proprietary screening methods 
we will continue to identify enhancers of alpha and delta enac and optimize these compounds to improve potency with the goal of identifying a compound that functions in taste tests by the end of the second quarter of as with the sweet program  our goal is to identify a product candidate and initiate development and safety studies by the end of the third quarter of in order to achieve the first commercial sale of a product containing one of our salt enhancers in bitter taste modulator program the goal of our bitter taste modulator program is to identify compounds that modulate or eliminate the bitter taste associated with certain packaged food and beverage products  otc health care products and pharmaceutical products 
in  we continued to make progress along several lines of research 
the first steps of this program involve the identification of taste receptors that respond to bitter ingredients known to be present in a variety of food and beverages  followed by the use of these receptors to discover bitter taste blockers 
a key accomplishment during was our development of methods that allow us to test fluorescent samples  which we previously could not test in our bitter assay 
these new methods allow us to test a broader range of bitter compounds in our screening process 
lastly  we continue to develop high throughput screening assays to identify bitter blockers 
we anticipate initiating screening for bitter blockers by the end of product discovery and development collaborations we pursue collaborations with leaders in the packaged food and beverage market

if all milestones are achieved  and including all research and development funding paid or payable  we may be entitled to up to million under the initial collaboration 
in addition  in the event of commercialization  we are entitled to receive royalties on future net sales of products containing a discovered flavor or flavor enhancer from the date of introduction of each product in each country until the expiration of relevant patents 
we cannot assure you that we will receive any further milestone payments or royalties under this collaboration 
in october  we entered into a second product discovery and development collaboration agreement with nestl to work for a five year collaborative period focusing on the discovery and commercialization of specified novel flavor ingredients in the coffee and coffee whiteners field 
under the terms of the agreement  nestl has agreed to pay us certain research and development funding over five years  subject to earlier termination under specified circumstances 
we are also eligible to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specific product discovery and development goals 
through december   we have received million in research and development funding 
if all milestones are achieved  and including all research and development funding paid or payable  we may be entitled to up to million under the second collaboration 
in addition  in the event of commercialization  we are entitled to receive royalties on future net sales of products containing a discovered flavor ingredient from the date of introduction of each product in each country until the expiration of relevant patents 
we cannot assure you that we will receive any milestone payments or royalties under this collaboration 
our technology we have discovered or in licensed many of the key receptors that mediate taste in mammals 
having isolated human taste receptors  we have created proprietary taste receptor based assay systems that provide a biochemical or electronic readout when a test compound affects the receptor 
to enable faster compound discovery  we integrated our proprietary taste receptor based screening assays into a robot controlled automated system that uses plates containing an array of individual wells  each of which can screen a different compound 
our receptor based discovery and development process has enabled us to improve our ability to find novel flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators over the traditional use of simple taste tests 
receptor discovery and assay development technology there are currently five recognized primary senses of taste umami which is the savory taste of glutamate  sweet  salt  bitter and sour 
scientists generally believe that each of these taste sensations is recognized by a distinct taste receptor or family of taste receptors in the mouth or on the tongue 
a taste receptor functions either by physically binding to a flavor ingredient in a process analogous to the way a key fits into a lock or by acting as a channel to allow ions to flow directly into a taste cell 
the brain recognizes tastes by determining which of the numerous receptors in the mouth have been contacted by a given flavor ingredient 
savory  sweet and bitter taste compounds bind to taste receptors specific to each taste on the surface of taste bud cells 
in contrast  the taste of salt and the sour taste are thought to be recognized by taste channels that allow the passage of particular ions into the taste bud cells 
the current status in the development of proprietary taste receptor based assay systems for human taste receptors is as follows savory receptor 
glutamate is a natural component of foods including tomatoes  mushrooms  parmesan cheese  and meats 
it is often added to foods in the form of msg to provide a savory flavor 
the human savory receptor is composed of two proteins called htr and htr the tr proteins are members of the g protein coupled receptor  or gpcr  family and are expressed on the surface of certain taste bud cells 
we created savoryscreenht  a proprietary high throughput savory taste receptor based assay system and demonstrated that it responded to msg and inosine monophosphate  or imp 
we have screened over  compounds in savoryscreenht and identified a number of savory enhancers  including s  s  s and s  which were determined to be gras in march sweet receptor 
the human sweet receptor is composed of two proteins called htr and htr the htr protein is shared in common with the savory receptor 
like the savory receptor  the sweet receptor is also a member of the gpcr family and is expressed on the surface of certain taste bud cells 
we created sweetscreenht  a proprietary high throughput sweet taste receptor based assay system  and demonstrated that it responded to many different sweet tasting compounds including carbohydrate sweeteners and high potency artificial sweeteners 
we have screened over  compounds in sweetscreenht and identified novel compounds that modulate sweet taste 
bitter receptors 
there are bitter receptors in humans 
these are also members of the gpcr protein family 
work from model systems showed that the bitter receptors are likely present together in the same taste cell 
the bitter receptors are believed to have evolved as a defense mechanism to warn of and prevent the ingestion of poisonous substances 
it is thought that each bitter receptor recognizes a different set of bitter tasting compounds 
we have characterized many of the tr receptors and we have initiated the development of receptor based assays 
salt receptor 
in contrast to the gpcrs that mediate savory  sweet  and bitter tastes  sodium ions and to a lesser extent potassium ions  are thought to produce a salt taste via ion channels present on the surface of taste bud cells 
ion channels are receptors that span the cell membrane and allow a flow of ions into or out of cells 
published work suggests that the epithelial sodium channel  or enac  is a mediator of salt taste 
we have characterized two forms of enac from human taste cells  termed alpha enac and delta enac 
for each form of enac  we have developed two proprietary enac based assay systems  saltscreenht  a high throughput system capable of screening thousands of compounds per day  and saltscreenep  a lower throughput electrophysiology based system 
we demonstrated each of the saltscreen systems are responsive to sodium and therefore could be used to identify novel salt flavor enhancers 
screening technologies and compound libraries we have developed or acquired access to expansive libraries of potential flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators currently comprised of over  natural and synthetic compounds 
we intend to continue to acquire or develop additional compounds to add to our libraries 
we have designed and selected our libraries to comprise compounds that we believe are likely to be safe and economical for use in packaged food and beverage products 
we are using our savoryscreenht  sweetscreenht  saltscreenht  saltscreenep and bitterscreen assay systems to screen the compounds in our libraries for their effects on specific taste receptors 
these systems use many of the same technologies that pharmaceutical companies use to discover medicines 
we also use these systems to assist us in optimizing our lead compounds by rapidly and iteratively testing the potency of the flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators generated in the optimization process as the lead compound progresses to become a product candidate 
regulatory process flavoring substances  including flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  intended for use in foods in the united states are regulated under provisions of the fd c act administered by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
flavor compounds sold in countries and regions outside of the united states are also subject to regulations imposed by national governments or regional regulatory authorities as is the case in the european union 
regulation of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators in the united states in the united states  flavor compounds are regulated by the fda as approved food additives  or as gras ingredients under the fd c act 
the food additive amendments of prompted the flavor industry to establish in the fema expert panel 
fema has administered the gras program for flavors on behalf of the industry for over years 
other possible routes to approval of a flavor modifying compound would be a gras self determination independent of fema with or without fda notification  or a food additive petition to the fda  however  few flavors are currently approved via these routes 
our goal is that the flavor compounds  including flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators we may discover will be subject to the fema gras review process as described below 
gras review process 
flavor compounds that qualify for the gras review process are generally intended to be consumed in small quantities and have data supporting their safety under conditions of intended use 
an expert panel  convened to undertake a gras review  determines whether a compound is generally recognized as safe under the conditions of its intended use 
these experts are qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of chemicals used in food and may declare certain compounds as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures to be generally recognized as safe under the conditions of their intended use 
under the gras process  manufacturers are required to obtain safety data from the scientific literature or through the conduct of safety studies  determine the estimated daily intake of the flavor compound per person and submit a report to the gras review panel describing the physical  chemical  safety  and metabolic properties of the flavor compound 
the entire gras determination process  including the safety and metabolic studies  application preparation and gras panel review  can take up to two years or longer 
however  if there are prior safety data on the compound or a compound with a related structure  then fewer safety studies may be required for the gras review and the gras review process can be considerably shorter than two years 
the most common types of gras review are fema expert panel 
the fema expert panel is an independent panel of experts established by fema 
the fema expert panel  which may be used by fema members and certain other parties  meets at least three times per year 
the conclusions of the expert panel regarding a flavor or flavor enhancer are provided directly to the fda and published in the journal food technology 
to our knowledge  the fda has not challenged the fema expert panel s conclusion that the use of a flavoring substance is gras 
in  the fema expert panel published its findings on new compounds determined to be gras for specific flavor applications 
we have been an associate member of fema since four of our savory compounds were determined to be gras by the fema expert panel in specifically convened independent panel 
an independent  qualified panel of experts in pertinent scientific disciplines may be formed by the manufacturer to evaluate the safety of a specific compound for gras status 
this process is known as a self determination of gras status 
the basis for the gras self determination is not required to be submitted to the fda 
however  the fda may request information on compounds that have been self determined to be gras  or the information may be provided voluntarily 
food additive petition process 
food ingredients for which the gras process is not available may be evaluated as food additives 
food additives require fda approval prior to use in foods 
a compound may be ineligible for gras determination  and may be considered a food additive  because there is insufficient general knowledge or for a variety of other reasons  including conditions of intended use resulting in high dietary exposure or the compound s safety profile 
if the compound is considered a food additive  a food additive petition must be filed and approved by the fda 
examples of compounds that have gone through a food additive petition include the artificial sweeteners aspartame  acesulfame k  and sucralose  and the fat substitute olestra 
the food additive petition approval process for such food ingredients can take eight years or more 
in the event that a particular flavor or flavor enhancer is not eligible for gras determination and therefore requires fda approval prior to use  we may dedicate our development efforts to alternative compounds that would be eligible for a gras determination 
benefits of the fema gras process there are three key benefits of the fema gras review process rapid time for commercialization 
four compounds developed as part of our savory program have received fema gras determination 
the process from selection for development until receipt of that determination took approximately months 
we expect that future flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators we develop will take a similar amount of time 
however  the length of time may vary depending on the properties of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator 
this is much shorter than the typical eight years or longer to obtain fda approval under the food additive petition process applicable to other food ingredients 
once the compound is determined to be fema gras  it can be immediately commercialized in the united states and other countries that recognize the fema gras status 
as described above  the initial phase of commercialization may include compound manufacturing  incorporation of the flavor enhancer into products  and the commercialization of products in consumer test markets 
low development costs 
the total costs for the fema gras process  including synthesis of material for regulatory studies  contract safety studies and preparation of the fema gras application is generally under million per compound 
facilitated approval in other countries 
approval of flavors for use outside of the united states varies widely by country 
according to fema  seven countries  including brazil  new zealand and australia  recognize compounds on the fema gras list 
an additional set of countries recognize compounds on the fema gras list in principle 
these include canada  china  philippines and turkey 
approval in these countries may require specific applications to the food safety authority of the individual countries but usually not additional safety testing 
license arrangements we have licensed rights from several companies and academic institutions  including the following university of california in march  we entered into a license agreement with the university of california under which we obtained exclusive rights to certain technologies held by the university of california that are involved in the biology of taste  including specified receptors in two taste receptor families  trs and trs 
the license may be converted to a non exclusive license  or terminated  by the university of california if we fail to meet specified milestones relating to the discovery of specified products and the sale of specified products and services 
our exclusive rights are also subject to rights granted by the university of california to the united states government and a private medical foundation 
the agreement required a license issue fee  payable in installments through  and calls for annual maintenance fees commencing in and royalties or service revenues on sales of any products developed using technologies licensed under the agreement 
royalties will accrue in each country for as long as there exists a valid patent claim covering a product developed under the agreement 
no royalty payments have accrued under the agreement to date 
the agreement will remain in effect until the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent licensed under the agreement  or ten years from the date that the last product to be developed under the agreement is introduced to market in the united states 
we may terminate the agreement at any time  without cause  upon notice to the university of california 
the university of california may terminate the agreement upon a breach of our obligations under the agreement 
in addition  we are in discussions with the university of california to amend the license agreement to include additional related technology related to the coexpression of tr taste receptors 
aurora biosciences corporation in november  we entered into a technology collaboration and license agreement with aurora to develop certain assay technologies  which was amended april under the collaboration  we developed high throughput screening assays using aurora s proprietary screening technologies 
the agreement terminated in october and invitrogen corporation subsequently acquired certain surviving rights and obligations under this agreement 
under the surviving terms of the agreement  we maintain exclusive rights to use certain proprietary screening technologies with our taste receptor targets for the discovery of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
these exclusive rights are subject to rights granted under other current and future license agreements in connection with the purchase of certain screening systems  as well as invitrogen s right to grant licenses under its proprietary technology to academic  government and other non profit organizations 
our rights with respect to the screening of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators are fully paid up and will remain in effect  except in the event that we breach any remaining obligations to invitrogen under the agreement 
in november  aurora purchased  shares of our series c preferred stock for million 
competition our goal is to be the leader in discovering novel flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators for use in a wide range of packaged food and beverage products 
other companies are possibly pursuing similar technologies and the commercialization of products and services relevant to flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
although we are not aware of any other companies that have the scope of proprietary technologies and processes that we have developed in our field  there are a number of competitors who possess capabilities relevant to the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulation fields 
in particular  we face substantial competition from companies pursuing the commercialization of products and services relevant to taste using more traditional methods for the discovery of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
these competitors include leading flavor companies  such as international flavors fragrances inc  givaudan sa  symrise  quest international and firmenich 
these companies provide flavors and other products  such as oils  extracts and distillates  to consumer products companies for use in a wide variety of products including foods  beverages  confectionaries  dairy products and pharmaceuticals 
we also face indirect competition from other companies such as newly weds foods  inc  a manufacturer of food coatings and seasonings for restaurants  airlines and the food services industry 
we currently compete and will continue to compete in the future with these companies in collaborating with and selling flavor products and technologies to manufacturers of packaged food and beverage products 
many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources  research and development resources and experience  manufacturing capabilities  regulatory expertise  sales and marketing resources  established relationships with consumer products companies and production facilities 
we may in the future face competition from life sciences and other technology companies and other commercial enterprises 
these entities engage as we do in biotechnology  biology or chemistry and could apply this technology to the discovery and development of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we are aware of another company  linguagen corp  a privately held company  that we believe is involved in research on sweetness potentiators  salt substitutes and bitter blockers  specifically adenosine monophosphate  or amp  and has announced research and development collaborations with a number of companies 
while we do not believe that either of these collaborations is competitive with our product discovery and development efforts  we cannot guarantee that products developed as a result of our competitors existing or future collaborations will not compete with our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
universities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors 
while these organizations primarily have educational objectives  they may develop proprietary technologies related to the sense of taste or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products 
we may attempt to license these proprietary technologies  but these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
to our knowledge  there are no other entities using a receptor based approach to develop flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
methods for reducing sodium include the use of potassium chloride in combination with flavors and masking agents 
although savory flavor enhancers  such as imp  are commercially available  they are not very potent  are not patent protected and are sold as a commodity 
the blocking of bitter taste is typically accomplished by attempting to mask the bitter taste with a sweetener or another flavor ingredient 
although amp has received gras determination  we do not believe this compound has been widely adopted into packaged food and beverage products 
however  our competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  may succeed in developing technologies or discovering flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that are similar or preferable in the areas of  among others  effectiveness  safety  cost and ease of commercialization  and our competitors may obtain intellectual property protection or commercialize such products sooner than we do 
developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete 
in addition  our current product discovery and development collaborators are not prohibited from entering into research and development agreements with third parties in any particular field 
patents and proprietary rights we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are described by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
accordingly  we are pursuing and will continue to pursue patent protection for our proprietary technologies 
as of december  we had issued united states patents  pending united states patent applications and pending foreign applications covering various aspects of our proprietary technology 
our issued patents have terms that expire in through in addition  we have exclusive license agreements with johns hopkins university  the university of california  incyte corporation and aurora covering an additional issued united states patents  pending united states patent applications  issued foreign patents and pending foreign applications 
our policy is to file patent applications and to protect technologies  inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business 
for example  we may seek patent protection for receptors and nucleic acid sequences encoding receptors that are involved in taste and the use of such receptors to identify ingredients that modulate taste 
we also rely on trademarks to protect our proprietary technology 
generally  united states patents have a term of years from the date of issue or years from the earliest claimed priority date  whichever is later  for patents issued from applications filed with the united states patent and trademark office prior to june  or years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date in the case of patents issued from applications filed on or after june  patents in most other countries have a term of years from the date of filing the patent application 
our success depends significantly upon our ability to develop ingredients and technologies that are protected by our intellectual property and that do not infringe any competitor patents 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we discover and develop new flavors or flavor enhancers and technologies 
seeking and obtaining patents may provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property 
however  our patent positions are highly uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent standard regarding the allowability and enforceability of claims in many of the pending patent applications has emerged to date 
as a result  we cannot predict the breadth of claims that will ultimately be allowed in our patent applications  if any  including those we in licensed or how we may be able to enforce our patent claims against our competitors 
in addition  we may not have been the first to file patent applications for or to invent inventions relating to the technologies upon which we rely  which would preclude us from obtaining issued patents on the relevant inventions 
we are aware of other companies and academic institutions which have been performing research and have applied for patents in the area of mammalian taste 
in particular  other companies and academic institutions have announced that they have identified taste receptors  published data on taste receptor sequence information or have filed patent applications on receptors and their use  including the university of california  linguagen  monell chemical senses  mount sinai school of medicine  scripps research institute  pfizer and the german institute of human nutrition 
if any of these companies or academic institutions are successful in obtaining broad patent claims  such patents could potentially block our ability to use various aspects of our discovery and development process and might prevent us from developing or commercializing newly discovered flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators or otherwise conducting our business 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and process 
our policy is to execute confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of their employment shall be our exclusive property 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively enforce these agreements or that the subject proprietary information will not be disclosed 
we are not a party to any litigation  opposition  interference  or other potentially adverse ex parte or inter party governmental or non governmental proceeding with regard to our patent and trademark positions 
however  if we become involved in litigation  interference proceedings  oppositions or other intellectual property proceedings  for example as a result of an alleged infringement  or a third party alleging an earlier date of invention  we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and  in the event of an adverse ruling  we could be subject to liability for damages  invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products  any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights  or earlier date of invention  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  lengthy governmental proceedings  divert management s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous if available at all 
sales and marketing while we do not currently intend to establish internal sales and marketing capabilities  we are developing the capability to enable us to work closely with our collaborators and their suppliers in the incorporation of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators into their products 
under our current collaboration agreements  our collaborators are responsible for sales  marketing  and distribution of any packaged food or beverage product incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
as a result  we expect to commercialize our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators without incurring significant sales  marketing and distribution costs 
our five current collaborators  cadbury schweppes  campbell soup  coca cola  kraft foods and nestl  are recognized leaders in the sales  marketing  and distribution of packaged food and beverage products 
manufacturing we intend to utilize third parties to manufacture our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
under two of our existing product discovery and development collaborations  our collaborator may  in its sole discretion  manufacture itself or through a third party manufacturer the flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators it licenses from us 
the remaining four agreements require the collaborator to identify with us a mutually agreed upon third party to manufacture the flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators it licenses from us 
in some of these agreements  we maintain either the first right of negotiation or an option to manufacture based on provisions within the agreement 
there are a number of reliable third party contract manufacturers available to produce our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
our current product candidates are relatively simple structures making them easy and inexpensive to produce 
we do not anticipate any capacity issues because of our low volume requirements and the number of reliable and available manufacturers 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including with phd degrees 
of our full time workforce  employees are engaged in research and development and are engaged in business development  finance and administration 
we also retain outside consultants

risk factors you should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below  together with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and in our other public filings  in evaluating our business 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
risks related to our business we are dependent on our product discovery and development collaborators for all of our revenue and we are dependent on our current and any future product discovery and development collaborators to develop and commercialize any flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators we may discover 
a key element of our strategy is to commercialize our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators through product discovery and development collaborations 
to date  all of our revenue has been derived solely from research and development payments and milestone payments received under collaboration agreements with cadbury schweppes  campbell soup  coca cola  kraft foods and nestl 
substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future will result from these types of payments from these collaborations  unless we successfully commercialize a product candidate through these or other collaborators and earn royalties on future sales of consumer products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
our agreement  as amended  with campbell soup provides for research and development funding until march and gives campbell soup the right to terminate the agreement earlier without cause  provided that it pay a specified termination fee if it terminates the agreement prior to march  our agreement with coca cola provides for research and development funding until april  and gives coca cola the right to conclude the collaborative program earlier for any reason upon payment to us of a termination fee  provided that coca cola may terminate the collaborative period without payment of an early conclusion fee in the event that we fail to achieve a specified research and development goal by april   subject to payment of research funding through july  our agreement with kraft foods provides for research and development funding until december  and gives kraft foods the right to conclude the agreement earlier for any reason upon payment to us of a termination fee 
our initial agreement with nestl as amended in april provides for research and development funding through april and gives nestl the right to terminate the agreement earlier without cause on or after april   provided that it pay additional specified research funding if it terminates the agreement after april  but prior to april  our most recent agreement with nestl provides for research and development funding through october and gives nestl the right to terminate the agreement earlier without cause on or after october   provided that it pay additional specified research funding if it terminates the agreement after october  but prior to october  our agreement with cadbury schweppes provides for research and development funding through july  and gives cadbury schweppes the right to terminate the agreement earlier without cause on or after april  upon days written notice 
if any or all of our material agreements with our collaborators expire or are terminated  our revenue would significantly decline and if all of our agreements expire or are terminated  our revenue would be substantially eliminated  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our collaborators may not renew their agreements with us or  if they do  they may not be on terms that are as favorable to us as our current agreements 
our current collaboration agreements provide that we will receive royalties of up to on our collaborators sales of products containing our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
the actual royalties payable vary by agreement and depend on a number of factors including  for example  the product field  cost of goods savings  degree of flavor enhancement and sales volume of collaborator products incorporating our flavor ingredients 
it is possible that our collaborators will not incorporate our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators into any or all of their products within their exclusive product fields 
we do not currently have a commercialized product and cannot assure you we will have a commercialized product in the foreseeable future  or at all 
we will be dependent on our current and any other possible future collaborators to commercialize any flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that we successfully develop and to provide the sales  marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business 
we have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources that our current or any future collaborators may devote to our programs or potential products 
our collaborators may decide not to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators  or may pursue a competitor s product if our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators do not have the characteristics desired by the collaborator 
these characteristics include  among other things  enhancement properties  temperature stability  solubility  taste and cost 
if these collaborators fail to conduct their commercialization  sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner  we will earn little or no royalty revenues from our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators and we will not be able to achieve our objectives or build a sustainable or profitable business 
our present and any future product discovery and development collaboration opportunities could be harmed if our existing or any future collaborators terminate their collaboration agreements with us prior to the expiration of the agreements  we do not achieve our research and development objectives under our collaboration agreements prior to the termination of the collaboration periods  we disagree with our collaborators as to the parties respective licensing rights to our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  methods or other intellectual property we develop  we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous collaborations  potential collaborators fail to spend their resources on research and development or commercialization of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators due to general market conditions or for any other reason  or consolidation in our target markets limits the number of potential collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional collaboration agreements having terms satisfactory to us or at all 
we may not be able to enter into additional product discovery and development collaborations due to the exclusive nature of our current product discovery and development collaborations 
each of our current collaboration agreements provides that we will conduct research and development on flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators for use within one or more defined packaged food and beverage product fields on an exclusive basis for the respective collaborator during the collaborative period specified in the agreement 
because each of these agreements is exclusive or co exclusive  we will not be able to enter into a collaboration agreement with any other food and beverage company covering the same product field during the applicable collaborative period 
in addition  our collaborators competitors may not wish to do business with us at all due to our relationship with our collaborators 
if we are unable to enter into additional product discovery and development collaborations  our ability to sustain or expand our business will be significantly diminished 
we may not be successful in developing flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators useful for formulation into products 
we may not succeed in developing flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators with the appropriate attributes required for use in successful commercial products 
successful flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators require  among other things  appropriate biological activity  including the correct flavor or flavor enhancer property for the product application  an acceptable safety profile  including lack of toxicity or allergenicity  and appropriate physical or chemical properties  including relative levels of stability  volatility and resistance to heat 
successful flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators must also be cost efficient for our collaborators 
we may not be able to develop flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that meet these criteria 
if we or our collaborators are unable to obtain and maintain the gras determination or regulatory approval required before any flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators can be incorporated into products that are sold  we would be unable to commercialize our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators and our business would be adversely affected 
in march  we obtained a gras determination for four of our savory product candidates 
apart from these product candidates  we do not have gras determination or regulatory approval for any other product candidate at this time 
in the united states  the development  sale and incorporation of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators into products are subject to regulation by fda and in some instances other government bodies 
obtaining and maintaining a gras determination or regulatory approval can be costly and take many years 
depending on the amount or intended use of a particular flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator added to a product and the number of product categories in which the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator will be incorporated  specific safety assessment protocols and regulatory processes must be satisfied before we or our collaborators can commercially market and sell products containing any flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that we may discover 
a key element of our strategy is to develop flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators that will be subject to review under the fema gras process  which  based on our experience with the savory program  we expect will take approximately months and is less expensive than the alternative of filing a food additive petition with the fda  approval of which can take eight years or more 
the fema gras review process may take longer than months and cost more than million depending on the properties of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator  and if additional safety studies are requested by the fema expert panel or are necessary to explain unexpected safety study findings 
there is a risk that one or more of our product candidates may not qualify for a fema gras determination 
this may occur for a variety of reasons  including the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator s intended use  the amount of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator intended to be added to packaged foods and beverages  the number of product categories in which the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator will be incorporated  whether the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator imparts sweetness  the safety profile of the flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator and the fema expert panel s interpretation of the safety data 
even if we obtain a gras determination with respect to a flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator  the fda has the ability to challenge such determination  which could materially adversely affect our ability to market products on schedule or at all 
in the event that a particular flavor  flavor enhancer or taste modulator does not qualify for fema gras determination  we will be required to pursue a lengthy fda approval process or dedicate our development efforts to alternative compounds  which would further delay commercialization 
in addition  laws  regulations or fda practice governing the regulatory approval process  the availability of the gras determination process or the manufacture or labeling of such products  may change in a manner that could adversely affect our ability to commercialize products on schedule or at all 
sales of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators outside of the united states will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements 
in most cases  whether or not a gras determination or fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries 
a gras determination or fda approval in the united states or in any other jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions because the requirements from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may vary widely 
obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays  difficulties and costs for us and require additional safety studies and additional expenses 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or to obtain and maintain required approvals  our ability to generate revenue will be diminished 
we and our collaborators may not be successful in overcoming these regulatory hurdles  which could result in product launch delays  unanticipated expenses  termination of collaborations  and flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators not being approved for incorporation into consumer products 
these consequences would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
even if we or our collaborators receive a gras determination or regulatory approval and incorporate our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators into products  those products may never be commercially successful 
even if we discover and develop flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators that obtain the necessary gras determination or regulatory approval  our success depends to a significant degree upon the commercial success of packaged food and beverage products incorporating those flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators 
if these products fail to achieve or subsequently maintain market acceptance or commercial viability  our business would be significantly harmed because our royalty revenue is dependent upon consumer sales of these products 
in addition  we could be unable to maintain our existing collaborations or attract new product discovery and development collaborators 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of any potential products incorporating flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that we may discover  including health concerns  whether actual or perceived  or unfavorable publicity regarding our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators or those of our competitors  the timing of market entry as compared to competitive products  the rate of adoption of products by our collaborators and other companies in the flavor industry  and any product labeling that may be required by the fda or other united states or foreign regulatory agencies for products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have not been profitable and have generated substantial operating losses since we were incorporated in september we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional losses for at least the next two years 
the extent of our future losses will depend  in part  on the rate of increase in our operating expenses and the rate of growth  if any  in our revenue from our five existing and any future product discovery and development collaborations as well as from other sources that may become available to us in the future and on the level of our expenses 
to date  our revenue has come solely from research and development funding  upfront fees  cost reimbursement and milestone payments under our product discovery and development collaboration agreements with cadbury schweppes  campbell soup  coca cola  kraft foods and nestl 
in order for us to generate royalty revenue and become profitable  we must retain our existing product discovery and development collaborations and our collaborators must commercialize products incorporating one or more of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators  from which we can derive royalty revenues 
our ability to generate royalty revenue is uncertain and will depend upon our ability to meet particular research  development and commercialization objectives 
we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate from period to period  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline  causing investor losses 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based upon a number of factors  many of which we have little or no control over 
we operate in a highly dynamic industry and future results could be subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations could cause us to fail to meet or exceed financial expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline rapidly and significantly 
revenue and expenses in future periods may be greater or less than revenue and expenses in the immediately preceding period or in the comparable period of the prior year 
therefore  period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of our future performance 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include termination of any of our product discovery and development collaboration agreements  our ability to discover and develop flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators or the ability of our product discovery and development collaborators to incorporate them into packaged food and beverage products  our receipt of milestone payments in any particular period  the ability and willingness of collaborators to commercialize products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators on expected timelines  or at all  our ability to enter into new product discovery and development collaborations and technology collaborations or to extend the terms of our existing collaboration agreements and our payment obligations  expected revenue and other terms of any other agreements of this type  our ability  or our collaborators ability  to successfully satisfy all pertinent regulatory requirements  the demand for our collaborators products containing our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  and general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our collaborators research and development expenditures 
changes in financial accounting standards related to stock option expenses are expected to have a significant effect on our reported results 
the fasb recently issued a revised standard that requires that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value method 
the adoption of the new standard is expected to have a significant effect on our reported earnings  although it will not affect our cash flows  and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our projected future financial results due to the variability of the factors used to establish the value of stock options 
as a result  the adoption of the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal could negatively affect our stock price and our stock price volatility 
compliance with regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  is costly 
our efforts to comply with these laws  regulations and standards  as they become applicable to us  have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  general and administrative expense and management time related to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
if our efforts to comply with laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies  our reputation may be harmed and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
we may need to obtain additional capital to fund our operations 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  we may need to obtain additional capital or change our strategy to continue our operations 
in addition  our business and operations may change in a manner that would consume available resources at a greater rate than anticipated 
in such event  we may need to raise substantial additional capital to  among other things fund new research  discovery or development programs  advance additional product candidates into and through the regulatory approval process  and acquire rights to products or product candidates  technologies or businesses 
if we require additional capital to continue our operations  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of opportunities  identify and develop flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  develop technologies or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
in addition  if financing is not available  we may need to alter our strategy or cease operations 
in addition  issuances of debt or additional equity could impact the rights of the holders of our common stock  may dilute our stockholders ownership and may impose restrictions on our operations 
these restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  it could adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers  management and scientific staff 
if we lose the services of one or more of these people and  in particular  kent snyder  our president and chief executive officer  or mark zoller  phd  our executive vice president of discovery development and chief scientific officer  the relationships we have with our collaborators would likely be negatively impacted and we may be delayed or unable to develop new product candidates  commercialize our existing product candidates or achieve our other business objectives  any of which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have entered into employment letter agreements with the following executive officers kent snyder  mark zoller  phd  harry leonhardt  esq  our senior vice president  general counsel and corporate secretary  john poyhonen  our senior vice president  chief financial and business officer and nigel ra beeley  phd  our vice president  discovery 
all of our employees are at will employees  which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time 
we currently have no key person insurance 
in addition  our discovery and development programs depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists  including molecular biologists  biochemists  chemists and engineers 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among technology based businesses  particularly in the san diego area 
we also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our current or any future product discovery and development collaborators in a timely fashion or to support our independent discovery and development programs 
we may encounter difficulties managing our growth  which could adversely affect our business 
our strategy includes entering into and working on simultaneous flavor and flavor enhancer discovery and development programs across multiple markets 
we increased the number of our full time employees from seven on december  to on december  and we expect to continue to grow to meet our strategic objectives 
if our growth continues  it will continue to place a strain on us  our management and our resources 
our ability to effectively manage our operations  growth and various projects requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees 
we may not be able to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and  accordingly  we may not achieve our research  development and commercialization goals 
if we fail to improve our operational  financial and management information systems  or fail to effectively monitor or manage our new and future employees or our growth  our business would suffer significantly 
in addition  no assurance can be made that we will be able to secure adequate facilities to house our staff  conduct our research or achieve our business objectives 
we will rely on third parties to manufacture our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators on a commercial scale 
we do not have experience in manufacturing  nor do we have the resources or facilities to manufacture  flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators on a commercial scale 
therefore  the commercialization of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators will depend in part on our or our collaborators ability to contract with third party manufacturers of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators on a large scale  at a competitive cost  with the specified quality and in accordance with relevant food and beverage regulatory requirements 
any such third party manufacturers may encounter manufacturing difficulties at any time that could result in delays in the commercialization of potential flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
our inability to find capable third party manufacturers or to enter into agreements on acceptable terms with third party manufacturers could delay commercialization of any products we may develop and may harm our relationships with our existing and any future product discovery and development collaborators and our customers 
moreover  if we are required to change from one third party manufacturer to another for any reason  the commercialization of our products may be delayed further 
in addition  if third party manufacturers fail to comply with the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations or similar regulations in other countries  then we may be subject to adverse regulatory action including product recalls  warning letters and withdrawal of our products  or our collaborators or customers products  from the market 
further  because our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators are regulated as food products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  we and the third parties with which we collaborate or contract to manufacture  process  pack  import or otherwise handle our products or our product ingredients  may be required to comply with certain registration  prior notice submission  recordkeeping and other regulatory requirements 
failure of any party in the chain of distribution to comply with any applicable requirements under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act or the fda s implementing regulations  or similar regulations in other countries  may adversely affect the manufacture and or distribution of our products in commerce 
if we acquire products  technologies or other businesses  we will incur a variety of costs  may have integration difficulties and may experience numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may consider acquiring businesses  technologies or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to  and are not actively seeking  any material acquisitions 
we have limited experience in identifying acquisition targets  successfully acquiring them and integrating them into our current infrastructure 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating  financial and management resources  if at all 
in addition  future acquisitions might be funded by issuances of additional debt or equity  which could impact your rights as a holder of our common stock and may dilute your ownership percentage 
any of the foregoing could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our industry our ability to compete in the flavor and flavor enhancer market may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property that protects our technologies and flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
patent positions may be highly uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions  including the ability to establish patentability of sequences relating to taste receptors  proteins  chemical synthesis techniques  compounds and methods for using them to modulate taste for which we seek patent protection 
no consistent standard regarding the allowability or enforceability of claims in many of our pending patent applications has emerged to date 
as a result  we cannot predict the breadth of claims that will ultimately be allowed in our patent applications  if any  including those we have in licensed or the extent to which we may enforce these claims against our competitors 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is therefore highly uncertain and we cannot assure you that we were the first to file patent applications or to invent the subject matter claimed in patent applications relating to the technologies upon which we rely  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  others did not publicly disclose our claimed technology before we conceived the subject matter included in any of our patent applications  any of our patent applications will result in issued patents  any of our patent applications will not result in interferences or disputes with third parties regarding priority of invention  any patents that have issued or may be issued to us  our collaborators or our licensors will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  or new proprietary technologies from third parties  including existing licensors  will be available for licensing to us on reasonable commercial terms  if at all 
in addition  patent law outside the united states is uncertain and in many countries intellectual property laws are undergoing review and revision 
the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as domestic laws 
it may be necessary or useful for us to participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our competitors patents or to defend the validity of any of our or our licensor s future patents  which could result in substantial costs and would divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
technologies licensed to us by others  or in licensed technologies  are important to our business 
in particular  we depend on high throughput screening technologies that we licensed from aurora biosciences  technology related to certain taste receptor sequences that we license from the university of california and others and technology related to compound libraries that we license from third parties 
in addition  we may in the future acquire rights to additional technologies by licensing such rights from existing licensors or from third parties 
such in licenses may be costly 
also  we generally do not control the patent prosecution  maintenance or enforcement of in licensed technologies 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we do over our internally developed technologies 
moreover  some of our academic institution licensors  collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  our ability to protect our proprietary information or obtain patent protection in the future may be impaired  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the patent applications we and our licensors have filed have not yet been substantively examined and may not result in patents being issued 
many of the patent applications filed by us and our licensors were filed recently with the united states patent and trademark office and most have not been substantively examined and may not result in patents being issued 
some of these patent applications claim sequences that were identified from different publicly available sequence information sources such as the high throughput genomic sequences division of genbank 
it is difficult to predict whether any of our or our licensors applications will ultimately be found to be patentable or  if so  to predict the scope of any allowed claims 
in addition  the disclosure in our or our licensors patent applications  particularly in respect of the utility of our claimed inventions  may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability in all cases 
as a result  it is difficult to predict whether any of our or our licensors applications will be allowed  or  if so  to predict the scope of any allowed claims or the enforceability of the patents 
even if enforceable  others may be able to design around any patents or develop similar technologies that are not within the scope of such patents 
our and our licensors patent applications may not issue as patents that will provide us with any protection or competitive advantage 
disputes concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and extremely costly and could delay our research and development efforts 
our commercial success  if any  will be significantly harmed if we infringe the patent rights of third parties or if we breach any license or other agreements that we have entered into with regard to our technology or business 
we are aware of other companies and academic institutions that have been performing research in the areas of taste modulation and flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
in particular  other companies and academic institutions have announced that they have conducted taste receptor research and have published data on taste receptor sequence information and taste receptors or filed patent applications or obtained patent protection on taste modulation or taste receptors and their uses  including linguagen corp  mount sinai school of medicine  the scripps research institute  the university of california  monell chemical senses corp  pfizer  inc  virginia commonwealth university and the german institute of human nutrition 
to the extent any of these companies or academic institutions currently have  or obtain in the future  broad patent claims  such patents could block our ability to use various aspects of our discovery and development process and might prevent us from developing or commercializing newly discovered flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators or otherwise conducting our business 
the university of california  for example  claims certain patent rights relating to the coexpression of tr receptors that may not have been licensed to us 
while our technology is focused on the use of human tr receptors  we cannot assure you that it does not infringe such patent rights 
in such event  if we are not able to amend our license with the university of california to include such patent rights and our technology is found to interfere with or infringe such patent rights  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer a significant adverse effect 
in addition  it is possible that some of the flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that are discovered using our technology may not be patentable or may be covered by intellectual property of third parties 
we are not currently a party to any litigation  interference  opposition  protest  reexamination  reissue or any other potentially adverse governmental  ex parte or inter party proceeding with regard to our patent or trademark positions 
however  the life sciences and other technology industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
many life sciences and other technology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
if we become involved in litigation  interference proceedings  oppositions  reexamination  protest or other potentially adverse intellectual property proceedings as a result of alleged infringement by us of the rights of others or as a result of priority of invention disputes with third parties  we might have to spend significant amounts of money  time and effort defending our position and we may not be successful 
in addition  any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights or proprietary determinations  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  lengthy governmental proceedings  divert management s attention and resources  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements that are not advantageous to us 
should any person have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the relevant patent regulatory agency to determine priority of invention and  thus  the right to a patent for these inventions in the united states 
such a proceeding could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable 
even if successful on priority grounds  an interference action may result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference action 
litigation  interference proceedings or other proceedings could divert management s time and efforts 
even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses  diversion of management s time and disruption in our business 
uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any patent proceeding or related litigation could harm our ability to compete and could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an adverse ruling arising out of any intellectual property dispute  including an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions  could undercut or invalidate our intellectual property position 
an adverse ruling could also subject us to significant liability for damages  including possible treble damages  prevent us from using technologies or developing products  or require us to negotiate licenses to disputed rights from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the technology area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include license fees and ongoing royalties 
furthermore  necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
failure to obtain a license in such a case could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have  which could adversely affect our business 
we rely in part on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information  know how and processes 
our policy is to execute proprietary information and invention agreements with our employees and consultants upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of their employment shall be our exclusive property 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively enforce these agreements or that proprietary information is our exclusive property 
there can be no assurance that the subject proprietary information will not be disclosed  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
many potential competitors  including those who have greater resources and experience than we do  may develop products or technologies that make ours obsolete or noncompetitive 
the life sciences and other technology industries are characterized by rapid technological change  and the area of sensory or taste receptor research is a rapidly evolving field 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
technological developments by others may result in our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators and technologies becoming obsolete 
in particular  we face substantial competition from companies pursuing the commercialization of products and services relevant to taste using more traditional methods for the discovery of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  or for the reduction of salt  sugar  msg or bitter taste 
these competitors include leading flavor companies  such as international flavors fragrances inc  givaudan sa  symrise  quest international and firmenich 
we currently compete and will continue to compete in the future with these companies in collaborating with and selling flavor products and technologies to manufacturers of packaged food and beverage products 
many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources  research and development resources and experience  manufacturing capabilities  regulatory expertise  sales and marketing resources  established relationships with consumer products companies and production facilities 
savory flavor enhancers  particularly inosine monophosphate  or imp  are commercially available  and we will compete with the companies that produce these flavors 
imp is widely available and is a generally accepted food additive by the packaged food and beverage industry 
as a result  our existing and future collaborators may choose to incorporate imp or similar savory flavor enhancers into their packaged food and beverage products instead of our savory flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
in addition  we may compete with bitter masking or bitter blocking compounds  such as adenosine monophosphate  or amp 
we may in the future face competition from life sciences and other technology companies and other commercial enterprises 
these entities engage as we do in biotechnology  biology or chemistry and could apply this technology to the discovery and development of flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
we are aware of one other company  linguagen corp  a privately held company that we believe is involved in research on sweetness potentiators  salt substitutes and bitter blockers  specifically amp  and has announced research and development collaborations with several companies 
we cannot guarantee that products developed as a result of our competitors existing or future collaborations will not compete with our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
universities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors 
while these organizations primarily have educational objectives  they may develop proprietary technologies related to the sense of taste or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products 
we may attempt to license these proprietary technologies  but these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
our competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  may succeed in developing technologies or discovering flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators that are more effective  safer  more affordable or more easily commercialized than ours  and our competitors may obtain intellectual property protection or commercialize products sooner than we do 
developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete 
in addition  our current product discovery and development collaborators are not prohibited from entering into research and development collaboration agreements with third parties in any product field 
our failure to compete effectively would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be sued for product liability  which could adversely affect our business 
because our business strategy involves the development and sale by our collaborators of commercial products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  we may be sued for product liability 
we may be held liable if any product we develop and commercialize  or any product our collaborators commercialize that incorporates any of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators  causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing  sale or consumer use 
in addition  the safety studies we must perform and the fema gras determination we must obtain prior to incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators into a commercial product will not protect us from any such liability 
if we and our collaborators commence sale of commercial products we will need to obtain product liability insurance  and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive  or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products developed by us or our product discovery and development collaborators 
we may be obligated to indemnify our product discovery and development collaborators for product liability or other losses they incur as a result of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators 
any indemnification we receive from such collaborators for product liability that does not arise from our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators may not be sufficient to satisfy our liability to injured parties 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators or products incorporating our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  our liability could exceed our total assets 
we use hazardous materials 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our discovery and development process requires our employees to routinely handle hazardous chemical  radioactive and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
as a result of the increase in size of our operations  we were recently re classified from a small quantity to a large quantity generator of hazardous waste 
this reclassification may result in increased scrutiny of our operations by the environmental protection agency 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our discovery and development efforts 
in addition  we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
our property and casualty policy has very limited coverage for damages or cleanup costs related to radioactive contamination and pollutants and our general liability insurance policy excludes coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste disposal or contamination 
we do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance 
we may be forced to curtail operations or be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by others of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies historically have been highly volatile  and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
since our initial public offering in june  the price of our common stock has ranged from approximately per share to approximately per share 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many factors  including developments related to the fema gras determination and international regulatory approval of our products  developments concerning our collaborative agreements  announcements of technological innovations by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  results of safety evaluation of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  results of consumer acceptance testing of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators by our collaborators  delays in commercialization of our flavors  flavor enhancers and taste modulators  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  comments by securities analysts  general market conditions  fluctuations in our operating results  government regulation  failure of any of our flavors  flavor enhancers or taste modulators  if approved  to achieve commercial success  and public concern as to the safety of our flavors  flavor enhancers  and taste modulators 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us more complicated and the removal and replacement of our directors and management more difficult 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions may also make it difficult for stockholders to remove and replace our board of directors and management 
these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board of directors  without stockholder approval  which could increase the number of outstanding shares and prevent or delay a takeover attempt  limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
in addition  the requirements of section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
our shareholder rights plan may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plans may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by you 
such issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you and other stockholders believe such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
if our officers  directors and largest stockholders choose to act together  they may be able to control our management and operations  acting in their best interests and not necessarily the interests of other stockholders 
as of february   our executive officers  directors and stockholders with at least of our stock together beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
if these officers  directors and principal stockholders act together  they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of investors in this offering or other stockholders 
for instance  officers  directors and principal stockholders  acting together  could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider 
similarly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company otherwise favored by our other stockholders 
this concentration of ownership could depress our stock price 
we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future

in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future
