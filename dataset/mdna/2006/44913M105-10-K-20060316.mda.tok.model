we 
table of contents recognized a million loss on the writedown of the uk lease business to its estimated fair value based on purchase offers received from potential buyers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
b during  we performed a comprehensive review of our financial performance  market strategy  products  product development and life cycle management  and employee  customer and vendor relationships 
the objective of the business review was to create a plan to improve profitability and customer relations  transition more rapidly to bit technology products  rationalize operations and reorganize the company s corporate structure 
as a result of this business review  we recorded charges of million to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
c during the third quarter  we committed to a profit improvement plan which included the closure of offices around the world in favor of a more cost effective distributor sales model and the termination of our direct manufacturing operations in brazil 
restructuring charges in cost of sales include million related to the write down of inventories and other related costs 
restructuring charges of million  which are separately stated  include million related to the write down of a building and other fixed assets to their estimated fair value and million related to termination costs and other charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
d during the second quarter  we recorded an million charge to cost of revenue to reserve all costs previously deferred under our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry 
our decision to record the provision was principally due to the lack of timely acknowledgement and acceptance of the pending claim  the expiration of the contract during april and the delay in the negotiation of the extension of the maintenance element of the contract 
we believe that the delay was due to an internal scandal within the brazilian health ministry  which in no way relates to hypercom or our pending claim  but nevertheless  cast doubt and concern over the ability to recover  timely  the amounts owed under the contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
e during  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the early retirement of two term loans 
the loss resulted from the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loan discount associated with our term loans 
f during  we completed the disposition of all remaining operating units identified and initially held for sale in september in connection with the disposition of these operating units  we recorded a loss on sale of the units totaling million during comprised of a million cash infusion made by us in accordance with the terms of the sale  non cash inventory and fixed asset write downs of million  severance costs of million  the write off of million in uncollectible accounts receivable  and facility lease and other exit costs of million 
g consistent with our strategy of disposing of operating units not aligned with our core business  we sold our direct finance lease subsidiary  golden eagle  effective october   for million gross cash proceeds  and recorded a million gain net of severance and other exit costs 
as a result of the disposition  the net operating results of golden eagle have been classified as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented 
h during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the transition provisions of sfas  we evaluated our reporting units for impairment of goodwill and recorded a million write off primarily attributable to goodwill associated with the acquisition of golden eagle leasing 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a presentation of certain of the above information on a quarterly basis for each of our four quarters in the years ended december  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of hypercom corporation s financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ 
table of contents significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts payment terms for product and service trade receivables generally range from to days depending on the circumstances of each order or service contract 
payment on trade receivables from long term contracts is generally received within four months of the milestone approval date 
any payments not received within the agreed upon due date are considered past due accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments is maintained 
such allowance is computed based upon a specific customer account review of larger customers and balances past due 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into our customers financial status  as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the account receivables to selling  general and administrative expense 
sales type leases certain sales of product are made under capital lease arrangements and are recorded as a sales type leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
lease contract receivables represent the total lease payments to be received reduced by lease payments already collected 
sales type lease revenues consists of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio is recorded 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or customer credit conditions deteriorate  the allowance for uncollectible sales type leases may need to be increased 
unearned income  including an interest and maintenance element  is the amount by which the original sum of the lease contract receivable exceeds the fair value of the equipment sold 
the interest element is amortized to lease income over the lease in a manner that produces a constant rate of return 
the maintenance element is amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognition of the interest and maintenance income did not exceed of our net revenues in  or in addition  as part of the initial recording of our sales type leases  the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment is recorded 
the residual value is based on industry standards and our actual 
table of contents experience 
if market conditions change negatively  it could have an adverse impact on the estimated residual value amount 
during the fourth quarter  we made the decision to sell our uk lease business which comprised primarily all of our sales type leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  adjusted for absorption of manufacturing variances  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record reserves for estimated excess and or obsolete inventory on a product or part level basis based upon future demand and historical usage and establish a new cost basis for the respective item 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations  including the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position  software revenue recognition  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize product revenue  including sales to distributors and sales under sales type leases  upon shipment of product 
we recognize services revenue when services have been provided and collection of invoiced amounts is reasonably assured 
amounts received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues from long term contracts that require substantial performance of customized software and hardware over an extended period are recorded based upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
operating lease revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term 
the cost of units leased under operating leases are included in the balance sheet under property  plant and equipment 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables items can be divided into more than one unit of accounting 
an item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items which do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for one or more of the delivered item s  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in cases in which there is not objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s  we defer all revenue for the arrangement until the period in which the last item is delivered 
product warranty we accrue for estimated warranty obligations when revenue is recognized based on an estimate of future warranty costs for delivered products 
such estimates are based on historical experience and expectations of 
table of contents future costs 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the accrued warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
our warranty period typically extends from one to five years from the date of shipment depending upon the product 
costs associated with maintenance contracts  including extended warranty contracts  are expensed when they are incurred 
actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  patent rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
foreign currency all of our foreign subsidiaries and divisions use the us dollar as the functional currency 
accordingly  foreign currency translation gains and losses from remeasurement are included in current earnings 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currency are remeasured at period end exchange rates whereas non monetary assets  including inventories and property  plant and equipment  are reflected at historical rates 
during the years ended december    and we recorded net gains on re measurement of million  less than million  and million  respectively 
for the same periods  we recorded net losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies of million  million  and million  respectively 
these amounts are included in the results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws including rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note regarding the valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because earnings are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
overview of financial results the following overview will highlight certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years 
certain and amounts referred to below have been adjusted to reflect our decision to sell our lease business in united kingdom the uk lease business which is included in discontinued operations 
year for  we recorded a net loss of million loss per share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million due to gains in multi lane and processor sales markets in north america as well as our service businesses  offset by 
table of contents declines associated with the completion of emv rollouts in europe and asia in and the completion of a significant portion of an outsource manufacturing contract in late for one of our larger global customers 
the net loss was most notably impacted by charges resulting from a comprehensive business review and the discontinuance of our uk lease business 
during the latter part of march  a change in senior management was made 
an interim chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer collectively interim management were appointed to replace the former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the interim chief executive officer  william keiper  was appointed as our chief executive officer and president in august and a new chief financial officer  tom liguori  was appointed in november interim management commenced a comprehensive review of our financial performance  market strategy  products  product development and life cycle management  and employee  customer and vendor relationships the business review 
the objective of the business review  was to create a plan to improve profitability and customer relations  transition more rapidly to bit technology products  rationalize operations and reorganize our corporate structure 
the business review included the following actions and amounts implementing an end of product life cycle strategy  including identifying products and related inventory with near term end of life requirements resulting in charges of million  more aggressively addressing and correcting product performance issues  including negotiated warranty and product trade in trade out programs required for the end of product life cycle strategies resulting in charges of million  implementing certain workforce reductions  including members of the senior management team  sales  operations and manufacturing personnel  as well as moving certain research and development resources to lower cost foreign geographies  and compensation plan changes resulting in charges of million  vacating a leased building in phoenix  arizona due to the reductions in force resulting in a charge of million in future rental expense  net of estimated sublet recoveries  evaluating other assets and liabilities and evaluating the past underlying operating decisions or strategies supporting such assets and liabilities resulting in charges of million  investing in the implementation of a comprehensive product marketing function  and evaluating opportunities for short  medium and long term improvements in manufacturing costs 

table of contents the following table sets forth the restructuring and other charges recorded during in conjunction with the business review in thousands first second fourth quarter quarter quarter full year costs of revenue warranty charges and product return accruals inventory write downs one time termination benefits and related costs other total costs of revenue operating expenses one time termination benefits and related costs idle facility lease charge other total operating expenses non operating expenses and income taxes other  including tax impact of above entries total non operating expenses and income taxes there were no significant charges resulting from decisions and actions taken during the third quarter of as part of the business review 
the business review was completed as of december  while we believe significant progress has been made and strategic initiatives put in place as of december   we will continue to review and align our business as demands and markets change and evolve 
accordingly there could be additional charges in future periods arising from the decisions and actions related to ongoing business reviews 
in addition to the business review  we also evaluated our uk lease business during the fourth quarter and decided to exit this business and sell the existing lease portfolio and related assets  resulting in its classification as a discontinued operation for all periods being presented 
we recognized a million loss on the writedown of the uk lease business to it estimated fair value based on purchase offers received from potential buyers 
we continued to maintain our cash reserves  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  compared to million at december   despite funding the cash elements of the business review of million  and purchasing million of treasury stock  and without incurring any indebtedness to fund continuing operations 
year for  we recorded a net loss of million loss per diluted share on revenues of million 
our revenue growth in was primarily due to bringing our new bit products to market  expanding our multi lane and quick service restaurant customer qsr base  and serving the growing european market led by tightening security standards 
the results include a second quarter charge of million to write off all costs previously deferred under our contract with the brazilian health ministry 
the increase in revenues was tempered by a decline in gross profit as a percent of revenues resulting primarily from the aforementioned deferred contract charge in brazil 
to a lesser degree  the gross 
table of contents profit percentage was negatively impacted by pricing pressures in certain markets  a lower margin on a high volume contract with a domestic processor  sales to high volume multi lane and quick service restaurant customers  and incremental inventory reserves attributable to technology obsolescence induced by our new product offerings and altered market demand for dated products and components 
additionally  the gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the reclassification of certain leases as operating leases rather than sales type leases 
operating expenses increased by million in  from million in to million in operating expenses represented of net revenues in versus in this increase was primarily due to costs for section of the sarbanes oxley act compliance and higher selling expenses principally related to accelerating expansion into certain markets in response to market opportunities and pre selling costs related to longer sales cycle multi lane contracts 
non operating expenses net interest expense  foreign currency losses and other income loss decreased by million in this decrease is primarily due to higher interest income as a result of our increased cash and short term investment balances as well as rising interest rates and lower interest expense as a result of reduced debt fees and the cessation of amortization of debt issuance costs in we continued to build our cash reserves  increasing our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from million at december  to million at december  during  our working capital increased by million 
year the year was highlighted by the completion of our profit improvement and restructuring plan initiated in september with a resulting improvement in operating income and net income  strengthening of our balance sheet  and the sale of golden eagle leasing 
completing the restructuring plan during allowed us to focus on our core terminal and network systems business  which resulted in improved gross margins while maintaining operating expenses at levels appropriate to support the core business activities 
gross margins improved principally from continuing improvements in cost reductions in our core set of product offerings through reductions in material costs as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies 
operating expenses were essentially unchanged from reflecting a leveling off of spending to match our business model as contemplated under our profit improvement and restructuring plan initiated in september in addition to improving our profits  we were able to strengthen our balance sheet as of december  compared to december  improvements in our balance sheet included an increase in cash and short term investment balances  elimination of current debt and increased working capital and stockholders equity 
we maintained a million revolving line of credit with no borrowings during these achievements were principally a result of our profit improvements  improvements in our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turnover  and the sale of golden eagle leasing 
while we continued to experience improvements in the financial performance of golden eagle leasing  we decided a direct finance leasing operation was outside our core business and did not have a long term role in our strategic plan 
consequently  we sold golden eagle leasing in the fourth quarter of resulting in a gain of million  with gross proceeds received of million 
the following should be read in light of the matters highlighted in the overview 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the operating results expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated

the decrease in product and other revenue of million was principally the result of a decline in sweden of million related to the completion of a portion of a sales contract whereby we provided outsource manufacturing service to one of our larger customers in that region  europe and the far east and a decline in europe of million as was influenced by the migration to emv security standards  which was substantially complete by the end of  and a decline in asia pacific of approximately million or due to countries such as malaysia and taiwan implementing emv in and the effects of economic and credit control difficulties in indonesia and taiwan  along with pricing pressure throughout the region  offset by an increase of million or in north america product revenues due to increased multi lane and processor sales on a year over year basis 
the increase in service revenues of million was principally the result of an increase in our service operations in brazil and to a lesser degree mexico 
service revenues in brazil increased million from to due to a strong market leadership position allowing us to be the preferred service provider  including 
table of contents providing service on terminals of our competitors and gaining larger portions of the installed base of terminals belonging to the three major brazil card associations 
in addition  we have expanded our service offerings in the areas of transaction transport and other terminal management offerings 
mexico services increased approximately million from to due to general growth in terminals under service contract 
costs of revenue our costs of revenue include the costs of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases included in continuing operations 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue increased to in compared to in cost of revenue in both and was impacted by significant charges 
significant charges totaled million in  related to the business review  and totaled million in due to the write off of deferred contract costs 
excluding these charges  cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was for and for this increase was principally attributable to incremental reserves totaling million from sales type lease provisions from continuing operations  and million from warranty provisions on certain specific repair and replace instances that have been addressed fully as of december   partially offset with a reduction of million in normal inventory provisions  with the remaining impact associated with pricing and product mix  as there continues to be downward pressure on pricing

services gross profit percentage was in and in  excluding million of charges associated with the business review 
this year over year decrease in service gross profit percentage is principally attributed to excess inventory supply provisions totaling million recorded in above such provisions recorded in research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses as a percent of revenue was in compared to in research and development expenses for include million in incremental charges associated with the business review  consisting of severance charges totaling million  as we relocate certain research and development activities to lower cost foreign geographies  and the write off of certain capitalized software development for abandoned projects totaling million 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses decreased by million from million of revenue in to million of revenue in selling general and administrative sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  and facilities operations make up the selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for and for selling  general and administrative expenses for include 
table of contents million in incremental charges associated with the business review  consisting principally of million in severance and employment related charges  million in unrecoverable prepaid sales taxes associated with slow moving inventory and the expiration of utilization periods  million of future rent charges resulting from vacating a building located in phoenix arizona  as a result of reductions in personnel 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include a charge of for legal contingencies for certain tax cases covered under an amnesty program in brazil 
excluding these charges of million  selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million compared to million in selling expenses are expected to trend downward into since the full effects of the cost reductions surrounding personnel changes will be recognized for all of  versus only partially in interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income during compared to million in this increase is principally attributable to higher average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balances maintained throughout compared to and increasing yields on our cash investments 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the decline in interest expense is primarily due to the continued decline in our long term debt  and the reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs  as the majority of costs were fully amortized as of july foreign currency loss for was million compared with million in the decrease in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to the stabilization and slight strengthening of the us dollar against our foreign currency exposures compared to income tax expense income tax expense before discontinued operations for federal  state and foreign taxes was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
income tax expense is principally comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during  we continued to provide valuation reserves on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
these reserves are subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas 
due to our net operating loss position and our valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets  the consolidated effective tax rates for and are not meaningful 
we do business in a number of different countries 
tax authorities may scrutinize the various tax structures employed by us in these countries 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves  including our valuation allowance  to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense or reduction of our valuation allowance would result 
in addition  any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit could affect the individual items that comprise our fully reserved deferred tax asset balance

the increase in european revenues arose as customers purchased new terminals to meet the security compliance standards set forth by europay  mastercard and visa emv 
emv governs the replacement of traditional magnetic strip cards with chip cards 
merchants must upgrade their terminals to meet the new emv standards or potentially bear the liability of fraudulent transactions which chip technology would have prevented 
revenue growth in the us related to product sales to multi lane and quick service restaurant customers which we had not historically served 
the introduction of new products including the l terminal and unattended units allowed us to expand in the marketplace which contributed significantly to our record fourth quarter sales 
offsetting our revenue growth was the impact of an accounting correction made during the fourth quarter following our determination that certain leases originated by our uk subsidiary during the first three quarters of were incorrectly accounted for as sales type leases  rather than operating leases 
this accounting error  which relates to approximately  leases  resulted in a million reduction in net revenue for the first three quarters of 
table of contents finally  net revenue in benefited by a million transaction in brazil involving the sale of fully depreciated terminals we had previously leased to a third party under an operating lease 
excluding the million in revenue in  net revenue increased million or from no similar transaction occurred during the increase in services revenues was primarily due to additional services provided by netset  our service business in brazil

cost of revenue  excluding the write off of deferred contract costs discussed below  as a percent of revenue increased to in compared to in the year over year increase in costs of revenue as a percent of revenues was principally attributable to incremental inventory reserves totaling million recorded during the incremental inventory reserves were attributable to technology obsolescence induced by our new product offerings and altered demand for dated products and components 
write off of deferred contract costs during the second quarter of  we recorded an million charge to cost of revenue to write off all costs previously deferred under our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our decision was principally due to the lack of timely acknowledgement and acceptance of the pending claim  the expiration of the contract during april and the delay in the negotiation of the extension of the maintenance element of the contract 
we believe that the delay was due to an internal scandal within the brazilian health ministry  which in no way relates to hypercom or our pending claim  but nevertheless  cast doubt and concern over the ability to recover  timely  the amounts owed under the contract 
we are actively pursuing discussions with the brazilian health ministry regarding both the collection of the contract costs as well as renewal of the maintenance element of the contract 
however  there is no certainty as to how much will ultimately be collected or that the maintenance contract will ultimately be extended 
gross profit gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased to in from in the decline in the gross profit percentage is principally attributable to the provision recorded to reserve all costs previously deferred under our contract with the brazilian health ministry

the increase is principally attributable to variable costs attributed to our increase in revenues and additional professional fees incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  during we recorded a million charge to write off a marketing right that we determined had no future value 
interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income during compared to only million in this increase is principally attributable to our high cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances maintained throughout resulting from the sale of golden eagle leasing in october and our positive cash flow from operations 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the decline in interest expense is primarily due to the continued decline in our long term debt  reduced fees under our senior secured credit facility  which was amended effective december   and the reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs  as the majority of costs were fully amortized as of july foreign currency loss for was million compared with million in the increase in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to the depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign currency exposures compared to income tax expense income tax expense before discontinued operations for federal  state and foreign taxes was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
income tax expense is principally comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during  we continued to provide full valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets 
these reserves are subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas due to our net operating loss position and our provision for a full valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets  the consolidated effective tax rates for and are not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and occasionally from borrowings under a line of credit and or other debt facilities 
during  our primary source of cash was cash generated by our operations as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit during cash flows from continuing operations cash provided by operating activities is net income loss from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in continuing operating activities totaled million for compared to cash provided by continuing operating activities of million for  a year over year decline of million 
the decline is principally attributable to cash expenses associated with the business review for charges related to severance and employee related matters million and warranty repairs and replacements million  changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in a million decline and the remaining decline of million being generally associated with a slight decline in gross margins based on pricing pressures and product mix changes between years together with higher operating expenses during the first half of before the actions were taken on the business review 

table of contents changes in operating assets and liabilities and the related impact on our operating cash flows consist of the following change accounts receivable inventories accounts payable other increase decrease in operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash attributed to the reduction in accounts receivable on relatively the same revenue base and customer payment terms  which range generally between and days  when comparing to was offset by an increase in inventory spending to meet forecasted demands and the pay down of accounts payable balances as part of our cash management activities 
other changes represent normal fluctuations in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as deferred revenue and income tax related accounts 
cash flows from investing activities investing cash flows consist principally of capital expenditures  capitalizable software expenditures and the net changes in cash associated with our investment of excess cash generated by operations or proceeds from liquidations of investments to fund operations  acquire capital assets and use in financing related activities such as the purchase of treasury stock or pay down of long term debt 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to cash used in investing activities of million in the change is primarily related to investment activities surrounding the transfer of cash between investments held in cash equivalent accounts  such as money market funds and certificates of deposit  and investments held in short term investments  such as debt and equity securities with better yields 
additionally  cash used to fund internally developed software projects declined as we have completed the bulk of our development efforts related to the launch of our bit product line and we have better targeted and controlled development projects and regional activities 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in and million in during and  capital expenditures were principally for upgrades to computer software and hardware and equipment purchases 
we intend to spend approximately to million over the next twelve months for capital expenditures related to computer hardware and software upgrades  manufacturing equipment such as tools and dies and communication equipment 
cash flows from financing activities financing cash flows consist principally of the issuance of common stock due to the exercise of employee stock options  repayment of long term debt  and the purchase of treasury stock 
additionally in we received cash from the payoff of notes receivable from two former principal stockholders 
there are no further related party note receivable balances 
during  cash used in financing activities was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the primary reasons for the decline in cash from financing activities of million were the purchases of treasury stock in for million  which in there were no such purchases  fewer proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the payoff of related party notes receivables in for million 
cash used to repay long term debt declined million from and is attributable to our overall lower debt balances 
cash flows from discontinued operations see note and note cash flows from discontinued operations principally relates to our fourth quarter discontinuance of our uk lease business and our direct finance lease operation sold in the third quarter of 
table of contents cash flows from operations consist principally of net cash earnings from the uk lease business 
the increase in operating cash flows provided by discontinued operations of million in over is the result of a maturing lease portfolio which ordinarily is characterized by fewer defaults and steady payment streams  coupled with a decline in new lease originations 
cash flow used in investing activities for of million relate to cash outlays for a loyalty payment associated with the renewal of a long term sales contract and cash used to manufacture equipment held under operating lease  both of which did not recur in while the cash flows from discontinued operations of million in was significant to our increase in cash and cash equivalents  we believe our cash reserves and short term investments together with the ability to control certain cash outlays  such as the purchase of treasury stock  and considering a full year of cost savings related to the business review was not reflected in our cash flows from continuing operations  the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations will not cause us to be unable to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
should operating results from continuing operations prove unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
projected liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital and cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million at december   respectively 
short term investments decreased million from million at december  to million at december  we believe that these cash reserves and short term investments combined with our ability to influence operating cash flows as well as certain investing and financing cash outlays  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through additionally  we are actively pursuing opportunities to monetize our uk lease business which  if successful  would substantially increase our cash reserves 
should operating results prove unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods dollars in thousands 
less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases minimum purchase obligations total minimum purchase obligations include all outstanding obligations to purchase goods or services at december  including agreements that are cancelable without penalty and agreements which are enforceable and legally binding 
we estimate that approximately of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are non cancelable due to the customized nature of the order and the long lead time required 

table of contents debt amendments on january   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo the credit agreement  pursuant to which we will have access to a million line of credit 
the credit agreement replaces our million foothill senior secured facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement will be fully collateralized by short term securities held in our accounts with wells fargo and will bear interest at a rate set forth in each promissory note issued at the time of the advance 
the credit agreement contains customary default provisions and will expire in july at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
in march  we amended our credit agreement with wells fargo to decrease the line of credit availability to million and extend the expiration date until march  stock repurchase during august  the board authorized a stock repurchase program to allow the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
during november  the board authorized a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to an additional million of our common stock 
during march  we announced the adoption of a b plan for the repurchase of up to million of common stock pursuant to the terms of an existing repurchase authorization 
during and  we purchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million  respectively 
there were no treasury stock repurchases during the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction to stockholder s equity 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of under the share repurchase programs 
the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate considerations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k and fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised 
backlog we include in backlog all revenue specified in signed contracts and purchase orders to the extent that we contemplate recognition of the related revenue within one year 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the one year period 
as of december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  the decrease in backlog is principally related to the fulfillment of orders for major customers within the united states that are subject to a customer approved delivery schedule 
in recent years  customers have shown a reluctance to enter into long term firm commitments that we would include in backlog 
our backlog is predominately related to contracts with north american customers who comprise and  of the total backlog at december  and  respectively 
we have seen a change in order patterns  such that most sales contracts are now signed and fulfilled within the same quarter 
accordingly  we do not believe that our current backlog is indicative of our near term sales 
outlook in we intend to focus on initiatives to drive profitability 
key initiatives include revenue and market share growth  improving gross margins and reducing operating expenses 
we have dedicated senior management teams to specifically address and manage these key initiatives 
with the completion of our business review  the introduction of our new optimum product family  and continuing development efforts  we believe we have a solid foundation to move forward on these key initiatives 

table of contents we will continue to see competitive pressures on a global basis as we and our major competitors try to expand our respective market share 
these pressures will generally serve to decrease average selling prices for certain products within certain geographies 
we intend to continue to offset declines in selling prices with increases in volumes together with further cost reductions in our products  as well as continuing to differentiate our product and total electronic payment solution offerings from our competitors 
we will continue to leverage our existing cost structure on anticipated higher revenues in many activities were examined and right sized as part of the business review and we anticipate carrying our new right sized organization into  with only limited strategic capital outlays and resource additions required to achieve our business plan 
we will continue to manage our balance sheet and leverage our working capital in instances where it can help meet the objectives of our key initiatives for recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas r 
under the new rule  we are required to adopt sfas r for the three month period commencing january  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized as compensation cost in the financial statements based on their fair values 
as such  reporting employee stock options under the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb will no longer be allowed 
we have historically elected to use the intrinsic value method and have not recognized expense for employee stock options granted and our employee stock purchase plan the espp 
we plan to adopt sfas r on january  on a prospective basis 
upon adoption  all future employee stock option grants plus the balance of the non vested grants awarded prior to january   will be expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted 
we estimate that the impact of adoption will be an additional expense of million after tax for employee stock options granted prior to december  our espp provides a discount of from the market price and an option to purchase the shares each quarter at the lower of the stock price at the beginning of the quarter or the end of the quarter 
under the provisions of sfas r  the discount and option provisions under the espp are considered compensatory 
we believe the incremental compensation cost required by sfas r for the essp will not be material to our operating results 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas  on a prospective basis  as of january  sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas requires that those items if abnormal be recognized as expenses in the period incurred 
in addition  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversions based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or cumulative effect of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt this provision  as applicable  during fiscal year in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of 
table of contents the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december   and we will adopt this provision  as applicable  during fiscal year in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations fsp  which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the directive  adopted by the european union eu 
under the directive  the waste management obligation for historical equipment products put on the market on or prior to august  remains with the commercial user until the customer replaces the equipment 
fsp is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member countries in which the manufacturers have significant operations 
we adopted fsp in the third quarter of fiscal and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for fiscal in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it to have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days from date of purchase 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned which approximate current interest rates 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that our investments typically have interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do at times enter into these transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other asian and european currencies 
as a policy  we hedge the translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by our policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
we enter into forward or option contracts with our bank 
table of contents or other financial institutions to accomplish our hedging strategy 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real and british pound 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consist of mark to market adjustments which are recorded in earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see risk factors international operations pose additional challenges and risks that if not properly managed could adversely affect our financial results elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
at present  we have million in debt obligations and there are no borrowings under our line of credit facility at december  as such  our interest rate risk is limited with respect to existing debt 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
