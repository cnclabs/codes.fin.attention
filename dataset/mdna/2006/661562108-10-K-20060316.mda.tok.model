overview we are a telecommunications company with annual operating revenues for of  our original core business  which dates back to  consisted primarily of providing telecommunications services in our ilec territory  which today covers approximately square miles and is located north of the city of pittsburgh 
in  when the internet was still in its relatively early stages  we purchased a small isp as a segue into that market 
during  we began to expand our business beyond our ilec territory via a clec edge out strategy 
in addition  from through  we invested approximately million in our ilec territory to upgrade the majority of our network and to deploy a csa architecture in order to allow us to offer advanced broadband products 
today  the investments that we have made to develop our internet related products  to expand our business via our edge out strategy and to modernize our network for advanced broadband products have provided the majority of our revenue growth 
the great majority of our revenues are generated based on monthly recurring services and are therefore not subject to large short term fluctuations 
in addition to our core businesses described above  we also derive a portion of our net income and cash flow from our limited partner interests in three wireless partnerships  all of which are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless 
these partnerships  which have their origin in the s with the allocation by the fcc of b licenses  cover territories which overlap the majority of our ilec and edge out markets 
industry dynamics demand for the traditional voice telecommunications business has been negatively impacted by the proliferation of wireless services and their one rate bundled pricing plans that include large if not unlimited buckets of minutes  the popularity of alternative communication technologies such as email and instant messaging and by technological advances such as cable modems and dsl that obviate the need for secondary  and in some cases primary  access lines 
in addition  the telecommunications industry has experienced a very difficult period of contraction brought on by over investments that have created excess capacity in certain markets 
as a result  the industry has experienced a relatively high number of major bankruptcies over the past several years 
besides the negative financial ramifications of absorbing write offs of pre petition amounts owed from such carriers  we are now faced with many of these companies re emerging from bankruptcy with restructured balance sheets and greater financial flexibility 
broadband growth has been a bright spot in the overall industry during the past several years 
however  the broadband market is very competitive  with little differentiation to the end user customer between products offered by telephone and cable companies 
as such  pricing has been the main focus in winning new customers and retaining existing customers 
although the costs to deliver broadband technologies have decreased over the past several years  margins have continued to be squeezed by pricing decreases to customers 

table of contents the proliferation of broadband access has also resulted in new threats from innovative technologies  such as voip  that threaten to further decrease the revenues received from the traditional voice business 
besides potentially displacing the need for a secondary or primary line  the potential regulatory definition and classification of voip services which takes on many forms may have a significant impact on the current access compensation structure 
regulation and competition the telecommunications industry was greatly impacted by the passage of the act  which was the legislative instrument that opened the industry to significantly greater competition 
the degree and pace at which markets have been experiencing competition have varied  with most of the original regulatory barriers to entry removed in the markets served by the country s largest local exchange carriers  also referred to as the regional bell operating companies rbocs 
smaller rural companies  such as our ilec  north pittsburgh  were given regulatory relief in the form of exemptions and temporary suspensions from many of the competitive portions of the act in order to allow state regulators sufficient time to examine the public policy implications of allowing competition in rural areas and  if deemed in the public interest  to allow smaller companies to gradually prepare for competition and to restructure rates 
although we still maintain in our ilec territory some of the regulatory protections against non facilities based competition  we expect that over time these protections will be reduced or entirely eliminated 
while the act has placed a higher degree of uncertainty on our future revenue streams and margins in our ilec territory  it has given us the opportunity to selectively expand outside of that territory by taking advantage of the pro competitive aspects of the act 
we have pursued an edge out strategy into pittsburgh and its surrounding communities as well as into the city of butler and its surrounding areas  leveraging the network  human capital skills and solid reputation of our traditional ilec business 
the act primarily deals with regulations concerning intra modal competition that is  competition among traditional wireline companies 
at the same time  however  we have begun to experience a great deal of inter modal competition from wireless carriers and cable companies 
we view these facilities based competitors to be the most formidable  as these companies totally bypass our existing networks 
highlights and outlook net income for was  or per share  as compared to  or per share  for the  increase in net income was predominately a result of the favorable impact of a settlement agreement reached with a carrier in the second quarter of  a decrease in depreciation expense pursuant to changes in the useful life estimates of certain main categories of north pittsburgh s telephone plant and equipment  an increase in earnings recorded from the company s investment in three wireless partnerships and an increase in income recorded from the company s temporary investments 
the above mentioned settlement  which totaled  pre tax and covered the exchange of traffic between north pittsburgh and the carrier over a multi year period of time  resulted in a  increase in revenues and an decrease in operating expenses 
operating revenues for increased  or  over the impact from the aforementioned settlement contributed  to this increase 
revenues from all other sources increased  or  in the majority of this growth was attributable to our continued penetration into our edge out markets as well as our expansion of our broadband service offerings 
as was our experience also for for which our revenue growth rate of was lower than our recent prior historical rates  our ability during to grow end user revenues by adding customers in our clec markets and by expanding our broadband service offerings was partially offset by decreases in access revenues 
the phased reduction of penn telecom s interstate access rates in conjunction with the fcc s access charge reform order  decreases in our access and transit rates charged for wireless traffic and decreases in the neca average schedule formulas used to determine north pittsburgh s interstate revenue requirement  as well as some regulatory modifications and other events which have diminished the company s ability to earn above the historical allowable rate of return  have caused access revenues to decrease 

table of contents for  we believe that it will be even more challenging to grow revenues  and there exists a strong possibility that revenues may actually decline by several percent due to multiple factors 
first  for comparative purposes  revenues will have benefited from the aforementioned carrier settlement  which positively impacted revenues by  although settlements with carriers in the telecommunications industry in general  and for us specifically  are not unusual due to the byzantine nature of intercarrier compensation rules and regulations  many of which are based on pre competitive and pre internet protocol ip based models and principles  the settlement referred to above  which covered the exchange of traffic over a number of years  was unusually large compared to our history of other such settlements 
second  as discussed in more detail in the risk factors section under item a in this form k  we expect that interstate revenues for our ilec will be negatively impacted by both the normal modifications to neca average schedule formulas as well as the structural changes to those formulas that neca has proposed 
those expected decreases in revenue will be more heavily concentrated in the second half of  as the proposed new average schedule formulas would go into effect july  third  we have recently seen competition intensify in our ilec market as the two cable companies that overlap the majority of our incumbent market have recently launched and are heavily promoting their proprietary telecommunications offerings 
we have seen access line decreases in our ilec market accelerate by approximately lines per month in january and february of concurrent with the launch of the cable companies services 
our ilec continues to enjoy several forms of regulatory protection against non facilities based clecs  and the entry into our market by the cable companies marks the first main thrust of competition from non wireless service providers  other than the competition we have experienced in the past and continue to experience from facilities based caps competing for larger customers in business parks 
finally  revenues we earn from pris provisioned to isps in our edge out markets and the associated local reciprocal compensation access revenues we earn from terminating the pri traffic are expected to decrease in the consolidation of our isp customer base  which has led to the elimination of redundant and excess facilities  the general decline in the dial up internet market and the migration of some isp customers to managed host providers have led to the decline in data pris and their associated minutes of use mous 
comparing full year to full year  revenues from pri circuits were virtually flat but local reciprocal compensation revenues were actually up because we were able to bill for traffic above the growth cap set in the original fcc order on intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic by virtue of the forbearance granted by the fcc in october of in the petition of core communications  inc however  because many of the pri circuit removals occurred in the fourth quarter of  the positive year over year comparison in revenues described above was concentrated in the first nine months of as compared to the first nine months of revenues from pri circuits and the associated local reciprocal compensation revenues actually decreased by in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of we expect that comparative trend to continue in offsetting the above mentioned factors  we expect to generate new revenues through the addition of new customers in our edge out markets and by further broadband penetration 
in addition  we have seen robust growth in our multi megabit metro ethernet product  which we expect will continue in we are also focusing to an even greater extent on bundled product offerings  which we anticipate will drive value to our customers and serve as a tool for retention of our existing customer base 
we also expect to launch a business grade voip product in the latter part of  which we anticipate will enable us to further penetrate our existing edge out markets as well as allow us to expand in a low cost way into adjacent new markets that previously were less attractive from a full facilities based edge out approach 
total operating expenses for decreased  or  from the prior year 
as previously mentioned  operating expenses were positively impacted by a  decrease in depreciation expense 
in addition  benefited from the cumulative reduction to operating expenses associated with the aforementioned carrier settlement 
those items were partially offset by increases in the direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents  such as fees paid for leasing unbundled network elements in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not wholly provision over our own facilities and fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base 
in addition  combined labor and benefit expenses increased approximately  or  during 
table of contents for  our overall operating expenses will continue to be significantly impacted by the decrease in depreciation expense experienced in our results of operations for the fourth quarter of see discussion of depreciation expense under the results of operations vs 
section that immediately follows this section 
will benefit from using the reduced depreciation levels for the full year  as compared to only the fourth quarter for we expect our network and other operating costs in to increase on a comparative basis over  because benefited from the aforementioned cumulative reduction in operating expenses from the carrier settlement 
in addition  during we will be implementing a new billing and operational support system oss at our clec 
we also expect to see increases in the direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents in our clec edge out markets 
our cost structure is heavily weighted towards labor and depreciation 
as such  there is not a great deal of direct correlation between our revenues and our largest operating expenses 
we have taken steps to address our overall labor costs  including the workforce reduction program implemented in  the continuing use of attrition to manage our workforce levels and using our excess cash reserves to make additional contributions into the north pittsburgh defined benefit pension plan pension plan over the past several years 
in addition  pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement north pittsburgh renegotiated in  future hires are not eligible to participate in the north pittsburgh pension plan 
although we expect to see only modest benefits in the next few years  the long term impact of this should be a reduction in postretirement benefit expenses  which currently exceed  per year 
we have benefited from investments made in the last two decades in wireless partnerships  all of which today are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless 
instead of deploying the majority of our investment capital into forming and operating our own wireless business  which would be at a tremendous disadvantage competing in a market dominated by national carriers with billions of dollars in capital resources  we alternatively invested in three wireless partnerships serving pittsburgh and other portions of western pennsylvania 
total equity income recorded from our investments in the wireless partnerships increased in our financial condition and balance sheet have continually improved over the last several years through prudent investment strategies and strong cash flows generated from operating activities 
unlike the many telecommunication companies that have substantially leveraged their businesses  we have a greater amount of cash and temporary investments on hand  than our total debt outstanding 
our financial condition gives us the ability to invest in new products and or opportunities and the flexibility to continue to evaluate ways to create greater shareholder value  whether through our dividend policy  stock repurchases or other investment opportunities 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
vs 
net income for was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share  for the increase in net income was attributable to the following factors operating revenues total operating revenues increased  or  during this increase was the result of increases in local network services revenues of   long distance and access services revenues of and other operating revenues of  offset partially by a minor decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of 
table of contents increases in local network services revenues of  or  were primarily attributable to the following factors local dial tone revenues increased  partially as a result of total access lines including clec growing by  lines  or  from  access lines as of december  to  access lines as of december  more specifically  the total growth was a result of a  access line increase in our edge out markets offset partially by a  access line decrease in our ilec market 
also contributing to the increase was an approximate  increase in local dial tone revenues due to a revenue neutral rate re balancing at north pittsburgh during january of  which increased local residential and business rates and decreased intrastate access rates 
enhanced feature revenues which include revenues from custom calling features such as voicemail  caller id  call waiting  etc 
increased  mostly as a result of the growth in access lines and the up selling of these features in bundled packages 
local reciprocal compensation revenues increased as we benefited from being able to bill for traffic above the growth cap set in the original fcc order on intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic by virtue of the forbearance granted by the fcc in october of in the petition of core communications  inc actual reciprocal compensation mous have decreased  however  by approximately on a year over year basis due to the decline in data pris purchased by regional isps 
the consolidation of our isp customer base  which has led to the elimination of redundant and excess facilities  the general decline in the dial up internet market and the migration of some isp customers to managed host providers have led to the decline in data pris and their associated mous 
for over comparative purposes  the benefit from being able to bill for traffic above the original growth cap pursuant to the aforementioned fcc action has outweighed the negative impact of the overall mou decreases 
future periods will no longer be impacted for comparative purposes by the limitations of the original growth cap  which applied only in earlier years  and we therefore expect to experience a decline in reciprocal compensation revenues because of the additional mou decreases we expect to occur in the future 
revenues from other local exchange circuits  such as isdn bri  frame relay and local private lines  have increased by we have experienced growth in these circuits over the past year 
in addition  during the summer of  one large school district in our clec edge out territory ordered approximately bris 
those circuits were in service for only approximately six months in  while revenues for benefited from having a full year of the associated revenues 
the increase in long distance and access services revenues of  or  was primarily attributable to the following factors special access circuits generated a revenue increase of approximately  mostly as a result of increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold in our ilec territory 
in addition  an increase in trunking from wireless carriers and a network reconfiguration from an ixc  which occurred in the second half of  also added to the revenue increase in this category 
overall toll revenues increased we have continued to be successful in bundling toll in our edge out markets in which the number of access lines grew by  with nearly a subscription the company records and analyzes into three main components the elements that comprise the long distance and access service revenues category 
the first category  access revenues  reflects mainly per mou sensitive access charges  universal service revenues received by the company and end user interstate access line charges assessed on customer bills 
the second category  special access  reflects the revenues received from high capacity circuits primarily ds s  ds s and oc s that are provided directly to end user customers  in both the company s ilec and clec territories  provisioned to other telecommunication carriers for connection to their end user customers  and provisioned for inter office trunking and transport and are billed under the special access tariff 
the third category  toll  represents amounts billed to end users for metro area  intralata  interlata and international toll 

table of contents rate 
our ability to increase our customer base has been offset by continuing pricing pressures from the introduction of aggressively priced flat rate toll packages from other competitors and voip providers and intense pricing competition in the wireless market 
we expect the pricing pressure on toll to continue to intensify  as just recently the two main cable companies in our ilec territory have launched their own telephone services that contain unlimited calling packages at prices below our existing plans 
partially offset by the following access revenues decreased approximately  primarily due to first  as described in the text above discussing local network service revenues  there was an approximate  reduction in north pittsburgh s intrastate access revenues in conjunction with the revenue neutral rate re balancing that increased north pittsburgh s local residential and business rates and decreased its intrastate access rates 
second  as also discussed above  changes in neca average schedule formulas used to determine north pittsburgh s interstate revenue requirement as well as some regulatory modifications and other events that have diminished north pittsburgh s ability to earn above the historical allowable rate of return have caused these interstate revenues to decrease approximately approximately of this comparative revenue decrease occurred in the first half of as compared to the first half of neca s tariffs are effective on a july through june basis 
the majority of the revenue decrease was due to the fact that the july  through june  average schedule formulas produced a decrease in north pittsburgh s realized interstate revenues from those amounts realized from the average schedule formulas associated with the july  through june  tariff 
the new average schedule formulas  which went into effect for the period july  through june   did not produce a material change in north pittsburgh s realized interstate revenues  on a static basis  from the average schedule formulas in effect for the july  through june  period static basis meaning keeping demand quantities the same 
in addition  the fourth quarter of benefited from north pittsburgh s settlement contribution  as calculated by neca  for pool over earnings for the most recent two year monitoring period being approximately lower than accrued  resulting in a positive adjustment to settlement revenues 
third  in conjunction with the fcc s access charge reform order  penn telecom s interstate access rates have been phased down over a three year period that began in the final phase down decrease  which adjusted penn telecom s rates to mirror the incumbents rates  was effective june  and resulted in an approximate per month decrease in access revenues 
although penn telecom s billable mous increased approximately during  interstate access revenues decreased approximately due to the fact that the had approximately six months that benefited from the higher access rates 
fourth  reductions in wireless intercarrier compensation rates contributed to a decrease in access revenues received from wireless carriers  despite an increase in billable mous 
as the majority of the decreases in rates were effective in the beginning of the third quarter of  revenues for were impacted by a full twelve months of the reduced rates while revenues for were impacted by the reduced rates for only the last six months of that year 
revenues from wireless intercarrier compensation for the second half of actually increased over the prior year comparable period because the rates were comparatively the same and  as noted above  the billable mous increased 
the above mentioned factors were partially mitigated in the second quarter of by the positive impact of the aforementioned settlement between north pittsburgh and a carrier  which resulted in a  increase in terminating access revenues realized over the amount which had been estimated and accrued over a multi year period 
concurrent with the execution of the settlement agreement  north pittsburgh also executed an interconnection agreement with the carrier 
during the last nine months of  when the interconnection agreement was in place  north pittsburgh s revenues 
table of contents benefited by approximately as a result of the difference between the final rates and terms of the interconnection agreement from those used historically in our estimates 
the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to the growth in dsl and multi megabit metro ethernet revenues 
combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail sold increased from  as of december  to  as of december  also  we introduced in a multi megabit metro ethernet product that can deliver speeds from to megabits  surpassing the existing top speed of our dsl product 
currently geared mostly for business applications  the multi megabit metro ethernet product experienced robust growth during revenues earned from other internet related products and services  such as web development services  also increased over the prior year 
the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of was not material 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses decreased  or  during the change was the result of decreases in depreciation and amortization expenses of  and state and local taxes of  offset partially by increases in network and other operating expenses of  the decrease in consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was predominately the result of changes in the useful life estimates of certain main categories of north pittsburgh s telephone plant and equipment 
during  north pittsburgh conducted a comprehensive review of the useful life estimates of certain main categories of its telephone plant and equipment 
pursuant to that review  effective october   north pittsburgh increased its useful life estimate for telephone poles 
in addition  effective october   north pittsburgh assigned a year useful life to the remaining net book value of central office equipment 
the adjustments were required to more closely align the remaining depreciable lives of these assets with their true economic lives 
these changes in accounting estimates  which affected our fourth quarter results of operations  decreased our depreciation expense by  otherwise  depreciation expense for all other assets increased as the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment grew over the course of the decrease in state and local taxes of  or  was attributable mostly to a nominal decrease in pennsylvania capital stock tax expense pursuant to a decrease in the effective tax rate for the increase in network and other operating expenses of  or  was primarily attributable to the following factors increases in direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents 
such direct costs include the fees paid for leasing unbundled network elements in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not provision over our own facilities and fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base 
increases in combined labor and benefit expenses of approximately  or  during payroll expense was up due in part to the effects of the normal year over year wage increases 
in addition  capitalized labor decreased approximately from the prior year  due mostly to a greater mix of repair and maintenance work as compared to capital construction work during current benefit expenses mostly composed of medical insurance premiums declined slightly  primarily due to decreases in medical insurance premiums at the company s north pittsburgh subsidiary as a result of an increase in employee co payments as well as more favorable experience ratings received for our premiums and premium increases were abnormally large due to an unusually high number of severe medical cases which negatively impacted the experience rated portion of our insurance premiums 
aggregate postretirement benefit expenses  as addressed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k  remained relatively constant year over year 

table of contents the above mentioned factors were partially mitigated in the second quarter of by the positive impact of the aforementioned settlement between north pittsburgh and a carrier  resulting in a cumulative reduction in traffic termination costs from the amount that was estimated and accrued over a multi year period 
as previously discussed  concurrently with the settlement agreement  north pittsburgh executed an interconnection agreement with the carrier 
however  the amount of traffic that north pittsburgh terminates to the carrier has decreased approximately over the past several years  and therefore the final rates and terms of the interconnection agreement did not have a material impact on our operating expenses on a going forward basis 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the decrease in total operating expenses of  resulted in a  or  increase in net operating income in as compared to other items interest expense decreased during by due to the continued scheduled pay down of our federal financing bank ffb notes and capital lease obligation 
interest income increased  during due to higher average invested cash balances as well as increases in the average interest rate received on our temporary investments 
our average interest rate earned on investments was during as compared to during dividend income decreased during  mostly as a result of the dividend yield on our rural telephone bank rtb class c stock decreasing to in as compared to in the dividend income from the rtb class c stock represents  of the  in total dividend income earned for pursuant to the liquidation of the rtb and redemption of our rtb stock as described in more detail in the subsequent event rtb stock redemption section below  we will no longer receive such dividends 
as a result  dividend income will diminish greatly in equity income of affiliated companies increased during due mainly to a increase in the amount of income generated from the company s limited partner interests in three wireless partnerships 
these partnerships  all of which are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless  have continued to show strong growth in the numbers of customers 
we also benefited from a reduction in the partnerships switching costs that became effective with the partnerships results of operations recorded in our second quarter of  which we estimate has contributed approximately to the overall increase in equity income the positive comparative impact was experienced primarily in the first quarter of over the first quarter of results 
the growth in equity income from these wireless partnerships was lower in than experienced in  however  due partially to the fact that the above mentioned reduction in switching costs had a much greater impact on the comparative results for over in addition  customer acquisition costs increased during and net roaming expense increased  especially for the rsa ii partnership which covers many of the growing northern communities outside pittsburgh many of these customers travel into pittsburgh and its suburbs for work and incur roaming expense for the partnership 
finally  we recorded a decrease in equity income during as a result of adjustments to the partnerships results of operations pursuant to their annual audits for the changes in sundry expense net were not material 
income taxes federal and state income tax expense was  for  which reflected a tax expense of  on income from continuing operations and a tax benefit of on the loss from discontinued operations 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was for as compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially a result of the decrease in the valuation allowance for state net operating loss nol carryforwards  which produced a tax benefit of in as compared to in the larger tax benefit recorded in was primarily a result of the elimination of a valuation allowance on one 
table of contents of our subsidiaries pursuant to its current history of producing state taxable income  which has enabled us to predict that it is now probable that all of the nol will be utilized 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was also impacted by a positive true up of our income tax liability during vs 
net income for was  or per share  compared to net income of  or 
per share  for the increase in net income was attributable to the following factors operating revenues total operating revenues increased  or  during this increase was the result of increases in local network services revenues of   directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of and other operating revenues of   offset partially by decreases in long distance and access services revenues of 
increases in local network services revenues of  or  were primarily attributable to the following factors local dial tone revenues increased  partially as a result of total access lines including clec growing by  lines  or  from  access lines as of december  to  access lines as of december  more specifically  the total growth was a result of a  access line increase in our edge out markets offset partially by a  access line decrease in our ilec market 
also contributing to the increase was an approximate  increase in local dial tone revenues due to revenue neutral rate re balancings at north pittsburgh during april and december of  which increased local residential rates and decreased intrastate access rates 
revenues earned from pris increased  mostly as a result of an increase in the average number of circuits in our edge out markets during the course of however  the increase in the average number of circuits was more heavily weighted to the first half of in comparison to the first half of our pri circuit count began to diminish in the second half of  primarily due to the consolidation of our isp customer base  which led to an elimination of redundant facilities 
enhanced feature revenues which include revenues from custom calling features such as voicemail  caller id  call waiting  etc 
increased during  mostly as a result of the growth in access lines and the up selling of these features in bundled packages 
the growth rate in such revenues experienced in was lower than the increase in such revenues experienced in due mostly to the fact that average revenue received per enhanced feature declined as these features are often discounted in the bundled packages 
local reciprocal compensation revenues increased during in association with the growth in terminating traffic generated by the above mentioned increase in access lines 
in addition  we benefited from being able to bill for traffic above the growth cap set in the original fcc order on intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic by virtue of the forbearance granted by the fcc in october of in the petition of core communications  inc the increase in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of was mostly attributable to the first quarter including an approximate reduction in revenues recorded in anticipation of a lower settlement for the directory book than originally estimated 
the positive increase in directory advertising revenues was partially offset by a decrease in carrier billing and collection revenues as the volumes of services and calls billed on behalf of other carriers have continued to decrease 
the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to growth in dsl revenues of approximately  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail sold increased from  as of december  to  as of december  
table of contents the decrease in long distance and access services revenues of  or  was primarily attributable to the following factors access revenues decreased  primarily due to four factors 
first  as previously described in the text above that discusses local network services revenues  there was an approximate  reduction in north pittsburgh s intrastate access revenues in conjunction with the revenue neutral rate re balancings that increased north pittsburgh s local residential rates and decreased its intrastate access rates 
second  the second quarter was favorably impacted by in final intercarrier settlement adjustments covering a two year period 
third  penn telecom experienced reductions in its effective intercarrier compensation rates  the most significant of which was a revision made between verizon and penn telecom in september of in the percent local use plu factor used to settle traffic between the companies 
at that time  the plu factor change resulted in an approximate per month decrease in intrastate access revenues recognized 
also  in conjunction with the fcc s access charge reform order  penn telecom s interstate access rates were phased down over a three year period that began in the final decrease  which adjusted penn telecom s rates to mirror the incumbents rates  was effective june  and resulted in an approximate per month decrease in access revenues 
although penn telecom s access line growth contributed to an approximate increase in mous on the network  the decreases in the effective intercarrier compensation rates described above resulted in an approximate decrease in access charges to carriers 
fourth  reductions in wireless intercarrier compensation rates contributed to a decrease in access revenues received from wireless carriers  despite a increase in billable mous 
in comparison  revenues from wireless traffic increased approximately for full year  as there were no material rate changes experienced in that year 
partially offset by the following special access revenues increased  mostly as a result of increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold in both our ilec and clec territories 
an increase in trunking from cellular carriers and a network reconfiguration from an ixc also added to the revenue increase in this category 
overall toll revenues increased we experienced success in bundling toll in our edge out markets in which the number of access lines grew by  in  with nearly a subscription rate 
our ability to increase our customer base was partially offset by continuing pricing pressures from the introduction of aggressively priced flat rate toll packages from voip providers and intense pricing competition in the wireless market 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses decreased  or  during the change was the result of decreases in network and other operating expenses of  depreciation and amortization expenses of and state and local taxes of 
the decrease in network and other operating expenses of  or  was primarily due to expenses for including  in charges associated with a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
the charges consisted of  in severance and early retirement incentives and  in non cash curtailment charges associated with the acceleration of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations 
an approximately decrease in the costs of contracted oss services for pursuant to a newly negotiated agreement in the third quarter of 
table of contents partially offset by the following increases in direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents 
such direct costs include the fees paid for leasing unbundled network elements in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not provision over our own facilities and fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base 
combined labor and benefit expenses for increased approximately  or  over excluding the  in one time workforce reduction charges in discussed above 
the majority of the increase was due to increases in current benefit expenses mostly as a result of increases in medical insurance premiums 
payroll expense remained relatively flat  as included the full year effect of the benefit received from the workforce reduction whereas that program affected only approximately eight months of that benefit was offset by the effects of the normal year over year wage increases and slight increases in the number of personnel serving our edge out markets 
aggregate postretirement benefit expenses also remained relatively constant for in comparison to excluding the  in one time curtailment charges included in the workforce reduction charges in discussed above 
this contrasted with double digit percentage increases in postretirement benefit expenses experienced over the past several years 
we were able to curtail the growth in these expenses by a decrease in the number of plan eligible participants as a result of the workforce reduction and by making additional contributions  above the minimum required level  into the defined benefit pension plan in both and in addition  we benefited from the strong performance of the assets in the pension plan 
increases in auditing and accounting expenses of approximately as a result of the increases in rules and regulations promulgated by various market governing bodies  most notably the requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of the decrease in consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the result of certain capitalized costs and license fees  which were incurred with the conversion to a year compliant oss approximately six years ago  becoming fully depreciated in december of this resulted in a decrease in depreciation for that set of assets 
otherwise  depreciation expense for all other assets increased as the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment grew over the course of the decrease in state and local taxes of  or  was attributable mostly to nominal decreases in payroll taxes and in the gross receipts tax expense 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the decrease in total operating expenses of  resulted in a  or  increase in net operating income in as compared to other items interest expense decreased during by due to the continued scheduled pay down of our ffb notes and capital lease obligation 
interest income increased during due to higher average invested cash balances as well as a slight increase in the average interest rate received on our temporary investments 
dividend income increased during as a result of a increase in the dividend received from the rtb 
as a result of the prepayment of our rtb notes in december of  we were able during january of to convert our rtb class b stock into class c stock a class of stock eligible for cash dividends 
because we held the class c stock for only nine months of the bank s fiscal year ending in  the dividend we received in the fourth quarter of was pro rated 
in the fourth quarter of  the dividend we received was for a full twelve month period 
in addition  dividend income from the rtb stock was positively impacted by the dividend rate increasing from in to in 
table of contents equity income of affiliated companies increased  during due mainly to a  increase in the amount of income generated from the company s limited partner interests in three wireless partnerships 
these partnerships  all of which are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless  showed strong growth in the number of customers and operating results 
we also benefited from a reduction in the partnerships switching costs which became effective in  which we estimate contributed approximately to the overall increase in earnings noted above 
in addition  for year over year comparative purposes  the results of operations for the rsa i partnership were negatively impacted by approximately as a result of the conversion costs incurred with the transition of the majority partnership interest from alltel communications to verizon wireless during and higher up front network investments and customer acquisition costs 
the changes in sundry expense net were not material 
income taxes federal and state income tax expense was  for  which reflected a tax expense of  on income from continuing operations and a tax benefit of on the loss from discontinued operations 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was for both and liquidity and capital resources december  december  cash and temporary investments working capital long term debt including current maturities cash and temporary investments were  at december  as compared to  at december  the increase was a result of operating cash flows exceeding investment and financing requirements 
cash flows from operations were  for  a  decrease from cash flows from operations were positively impacted by the receipt of cash from the aforementioned north pittsburgh settlement with a carrier 
however  for comparative purposes  was positively impacted by the collection of an approximate previously disputed receivable paid by a carrier in january of in addition  was negatively impacted by the fact that depreciation expense for tax purposes decreased substantially from the prior year  resulting in higher taxable income and therefore higher tax payments 
the decrease in tax depreciation expense is partially a result of the reversal of temporary differences between book and tax depreciation 
with the accelerated methods of depreciation available to be used for tax purposes  tax depreciation is usually greater than book depreciation in the early years of an asset s life but less than book depreciation in the later years of an asset s life 
many of the capital additions made in conjunction with our network modernization and clec build out capital programs during the period are now in the latter position 
in addition  capital additions do not benefit from federal bonus depreciation  which was enacted after the economic downturn following september  and was applicable only to additions made before january  cash flows from operations were negatively impacted also by the timing of working capital fluctuations  mostly as a result of the timing of when payables have come due 
cash flows used for investing activities were  for  a  decrease from the decrease was primarily the result of a  decrease in expenditures for capital additions  as included several large building renovations  expenditures for the majority of the core networking equipment for our voip product and expenditures for several software systems 
cash flows for investing activities were also positively impacted by an  increase in distributions received from our partnership investments 
we expended  during for financing activities  which included cash dividends and the scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
the amount was higher than the prior year period  mostly as a result of a increase in dividends paid 

table of contents temporary excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents with maturity dates scheduled to coincide with tax payment due dates  debt principal payments  dividend payment dates and other predictable cash needs 
we expect to continue the investment of such excess funds throughout  which should enable us to meet all short term obligations 
working capital levels at december  increased  from december   mostly due to the continued generation of cash flows from operations  which contributed to a  increase in cash and temporary investments as discussed above 
the decrease in long term debt was a result of scheduled principal repayments of  in we funded of our expenditures for property and equipment from operations cash flows and cash reserves 
therefore  no additional advances were requested from our available debt facilities 
in  north pittsburgh was granted approval for a loan from the ffb guaranteed by the rus in the maximum principal amount of  the total amount outstanding at december  to the ffb under this loan was  with all advances having a maturity date of december  the unadvanced amount of this facility as of december  was  north pittsburgh can draw against this facility through june  for qualified capital expenditure projects  as defined in the loan agreement  to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas 
as of december   north pittsburgh had approximately  of qualified capital expenditures that were eligible to be drawn against this facility 
the notes payable to the ffb are secured by a supplemental mortgage agreement executed by north pittsburgh  which provides that substantially all of the assets of north pittsburgh  which approximate a net book value of  are subject to a lien or a security interest 
such agreement contains restrictions regarding dividends and other distributions by north pittsburgh 
under these restrictions  unless certain working capital levels  net worth levels and interest expense ratios are maintained  north pittsburgh is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock other than in shares of capital stock  or make any other distributions to its shareholder  or purchase  redeem or retire any of its capital stock or make any investment in affiliated companies 
as a result of these restrictions  approximately  of north pittsburgh s retained earnings was available for dividends and other distributions to the registrant as of december  the registrant has no restrictions on the amount of its retained earnings that are available for dividends and other distributions to its shareholders 
however  because of the aforementioned north pittsburgh restrictions on dividends and distributions  the portion of our consolidated cash and temporary investments available for dividends and other distributions to our shareholders as of december  was  north pittsburgh also has available through june of a  line of credit with the rural telephone finance cooperative at a rate of prime plus 
no borrowings have been taken against the line of credit and there are no commitment fees associated with it 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and purchase commitments as of december  payments due by period obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations operational support systems obligations purchase obligations total cash obligations 
table of contents inclusive of current portion of long term debt 
represents total minimum lease commitments interest and executory costs are included 
we have entered into two contracts to outsource the majority of our operational support systems 
the first contract  which is effective through august of  has terms that make it non cancelable by the company through march of after that date  we have the right to cancel the contract but must pay a termination fee as defined in the contract 
a second contract for a separate system was entered into in august of and is effective for a period of five years after the commencement of the processing of the first billing cycle we estimate the first billing cycle will occur in july of  which would make the contract effective through june of 
should we terminate the contract prior to the expiration of the term  we will be liable for minimum monthly usage payments as defined in the contract for the remaining term of the contract 
the figures presented in the table are estimates  due to the fact that a portion of the fee relating to billing services is variable  as it is partially calculated based on the number of service accounts  as well as the fact that the term of the second agreement is contingent upon our final implementation and commencement of billing 
the purchase obligations category represents various contractual arrangements and purchase commitments that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
these obligations include purchase orders for capital expenditures  network maintenance contracts  multi year contracts for internet backbone services and company advertising sponsorships 
we expect cash flows provided by operating activities and cash reserves over the next twelve months to be sufficient to service long term debt and capital lease obligations  to pay dividends and to finance all capital projects 
we currently expect a capital expenditure program for in the range of  to  which would represent a  to  increase over those amounts expended in during  we have a capital program that includes deploying fiber deeper into our ilec network  which will allow for the eventual offering of more advanced data offerings and potentially other broadband based product offerings 
concurrent with the fiber deployment  which most likely will span a two year period  we also will upgrade our transmission network to a gigabit ethernet backbone 
the capital expenditure program dollar range indicated above assumes the majority of the purchases of the core part of the gigabit ethernet backbone occur in the fourth quarter of  although there is a reasonable possibility that any delays in technology development could cause those expenditures to be postponed into finally  several million dollars of our capital expenditure program relates to success based customer additions in our clec edge out markets that require capital and network capacity additions 
any substantial variations from our underlying customer addition projections could cause the success based capital expenditures to deviate from those amounts included in our capital expenditure projections above 
although we expect to continue to have the necessary cash flows from operations and cash reserves to internally finance of our projected capital expenditures  due to the low cost financing available through the rus for qualified north pittsburgh capital expenditures  we may request advancements from the rus facility in the future 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when local network  long distance  and access services are provided 
local service  intrastate long distance and intrastate access service revenues are subject to the jurisdiction of the pa puc 
interstate long distance and interstate access service revenues are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc 
revenues from equipment sales reported as discontinued operations were recorded after equipment was installed and accepted by the customer 
directory advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period related to the directory publication 
our north pittsburgh subsidiary receives a portion of its interstate access revenues from pooling arrangements in which it participates with other telephone companies 
such pools  which are administrated by 
table of contents neca  are funded by access service charges regulated by the fcc 
revenues earned through these pooling arrangements  which are based on nationwide average costs of the pooling companies applied to certain projected demand quantities  are initially recorded based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the final amount of interstate revenues realized for a given period 
management monitors the activity of the pools and establishes accruals  if deemed necessary  for estimated obligations to the pool 
the calculations used to record these revenues are complex and involve a variety of estimates  and it is therefore possible that the ultimate amount realized from the pools could differ materially from our estimates  although historically we have not experienced significant out of period adjustments to our revenues as a result of participating in these pools 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our accounts receivable aging schedules  history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
pension and other postretirement benefits we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  the long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on our current view of the long term returns on assets held by the plan  which is influenced by the historical performance of plan assets  asset allocation and third party studies 
the health care cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of health care cost trends 
with respect to the selection of discount rates  we changed our methodology during to replace our prior use of the moody s aa index 
instead  we have adjusted our discount rate selection by matching our estimated benefit plan cash flows to that of the average of two published yield curves  those being the citigroup pension discount curve and the mercer yield curve 
we believe that our new approach is superior in two main respects first  there is a much greater representation of the universe of high quality corporate bond securities in the two yield curves selected than exists in the moody s aa index and  second  the yield curves allow us to better align the timing of the expected cash outflows to the appropriate maturation of the debt securities 
for comparative purposes  if we utilized our prior discount rate selection methodology  we would have used for a rate of for the qualified pension plan with a october  measurement date as compared to the rate selected under the new methodology 
similarly  for the other postretirement benefits plans and nonqualified pension plan  under our prior methodology we would have used a discount rate for of with december  measurement dates as compared to the and rates selected under the new methodology for the above mentioned plans  respectively 
significant benefit plan assumptions  including the discount rate used  the long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan expenses and obligations 
a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations 
table of contents and expenses recorded as of december  and for the year then ended pertaining to the company s qualified and nonqualified pension plans and the other postretirement benefits plan is provided in the table below percentage point change projected benefit obligation increase decrease at december  accumulated benefit obligation increase decrease at december  expense increase decrease for the year ended december  pension plan discount rate long term rate of return on plan assets other postretirement benefits discount rate health care cost trend rate nonqualified supplemental pension plan discount rate the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
workforce reduction and business restructuring during the second quarter of  we instituted a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
this program  consisting of both layoffs and early retirement incentives  reduced the north pittsburgh workforce by people  or 
we recorded severance charges totaling  during because of the workforce reduction program  we also recorded curtailment charges and completed a re measurement of our obligations under our pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
curtailment charges totaling  were recorded in both the  in severance charges and  in curtailment charges were recorded in the network and other operating expenses line item on our consolidated statement of income 
subsequent event rtb stock redemption on january   north pittsburgh executed a stock redemption agreement between the rtb and north pittsburgh 
the rtb has decided to liquidate and dissolve  and the redemption of the rtb s stock is a required part of that liquidation 
north pittsburgh owns  in par value of rtb stock  with  of the par value in the form of rtb class c stock and in the form of rtb class b stock 
the  of par value consists of  expended by north pittsburgh between and to purchase class b stock  pursuant to the terms of north pittsburgh s loan agreement with the rtb that required north pittsburgh to purchase class b stock in the amount equal to five percent of the rtb loans advanced  and class b stock with an aggregate par value of  received as dividends since the original purchases 
because rtb class b stock could be held only by eligible rtb borrowers  because of the corresponding lack of a market for the stock and because the underlying valuation of the stock was in question  for accounting purposes north pittsburgh s original expenditures for rtb stock were treated as debt issuance costs  which were to be amortized over the life of the loans 
upon north pittsburgh s prepayment of its remaining loans outstanding to the rtb in december of  the remaining of unamortized costs associated with the rtb stock was written off 
there therefore is no original basis in the rtb stock remaining on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february of  north pittsburgh converted the majority of its rtb class b stock into rtb class c stock  unlike the class b stock  rtb class c stock was eligible for cash dividends 
north pittsburgh received cash dividends of   and on its rtb class c stock in  and  respectively 
the rtb class c stock  which makes up the vast majority of north pittsburgh s ownership interest in the rtb  will rank third in order of preference in redemption of rtb s stock  that is  the rtb class c stock will be redeemed only after funds have been set aside for payment of all rtb class a stock all of which is held by the government of the united states and all rtb class b stock 
it is our current understanding  based on a report given at the rtb s staff briefing on february   which was an open meeting for the public  that pursuant to the recent completion of the rtb s audit for its fiscal year ended september   the rtb expects to have enough funds to redeem all classes of stock at par value 
based on communications received from the rtb  we expect the stock redemption payments to be made in the second quarter of it has recently come to our attention that certain questions have arisen as to whether some of the proceeds from the rtb stock redemptions should be subject to regulatory recapture 
based on our understanding of the treatment of the original acquisition costs of the rtb stock ie the original purchases which equated to five percent of the loans advanced  the fcc allowed  and certain cost companies may have included  the investment value in their investment base for cost studies 
the fcc rules would then appear to require  in the interstate jurisdiction  some form of recapture  most likely in the form of reduced interstate revenue requirements 
as of the date of this report  there are currently many uncertainties that exist and questions that remain open as to the ultimate exposure of the rtb redemption payments to regulatory recapture  the impact on north pittsburgh as an average schedule company and the specific impact on north pittsburgh based on the fact that for accounting purposes it treated its original investments as debt issuance costs  which were reduced through amortization over time 
we will recognize a gain in the amount of the total proceeds received for the rtb stock  less any estimates for regulatory recapture  at the time the proceeds are received 
the transaction will be subject to income taxes 
regulatory environment both north pittsburgh and penn telecom are subject to regulatory oversight by the pa puc for intrastate services and the fcc for interstate services 
the pa puc and the fcc have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities  rates and charges  securities  the encumbering or disposition of public utility properties  accounting and various other matters 
federal regulatory matters the fcc regulates the rates  the system of financial accounts for reporting purposes  rules for interconnection with other carriers  universal service funding  certain aspects of service quality  the use of numbering resources  compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea  and other aspects related to north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s provision of interstate services 
interconnection rules in  congress passed the act  which has the goal of opening the telecommunications industry to further competition for all services  including the local exchange market 
the act prohibits state legislative or regulatory restrictions or barriers to entry regarding the provision of local telephone service 
it also requires most ilecs to interconnect with the networks of other telecommunications carriers  unbundle their services into network elements  offer their telecommunications services at wholesale rates in order to permit the resale of such services and allow other telecommunications carriers to locate equipment on their premises 
local exchange telephone carriers are also required to compensate each other for the transport and termination of calls 
the fcc has issued a number of rulemakings that continue to implement the requirements of the act and are 
table of contents intended to facilitate the resale of services at wholesale rates and provide for local number portability lnp  dialing parity  interconnection to any requesting carrier and access to network elements 
north pittsburgh s wireline operations are considered rural under the act and are exempt from certain of the foregoing obligations unless  in response to a bona fide request for interconnection  the pa puc removes that exemption 
more specifically  pursuant to the rural exemption provision of section f of the act  north pittsburgh is currently exempted from offering collocation  unes  wholesale discounts and certain other requirements of the act which originally pertained to non rural ilecs 
however  upon a petition by a potential competitor  the pa puc may grant the removal of north pittsburgh s rural exemption if it finds that the competitor s proposal is not unduly economically burdensome to north pittsburgh  is technically feasible and is consistent with the universal service provisions of the act 
the burden of proof in such a proceeding rests with the competitor 
the rural exemption does not  however  prevent facilities based competition in north pittsburgh s service area 
north pittsburgh has received several requests from facilities based clecs to negotiate interconnection agreements and is now in the process of either negotiating or implementing those agreements 
triennial review order and related matters on february   the fcc issued its triennial review order tro regarding the act 
in that order  the fcc eliminated unbundling requirements for ilecs in regard to broadband services provided over fiber facilities but continued to require unbundled access to mass market narrowband loops 
in addition  ilecs were not required to unbundle packet switching services 
the fcc further found that the high frequency portion of the loop  also referred to as line sharing  was no longer required to be provided as a une and that requirement would therefore be phased out over three years 
other aspects of the original tro filing  especially in regards to the rules pertaining to the availability of the local switching une une p  were later remanded back to the fcc 
on march   the u 
s 
court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision in response to a number of court appeals filed in regard to the fcc s tro 
in that ruling  the court upheld the fcc s rules in regard to their conclusion that ilecs need not unbundle broadband loops provided through the utilization of new technologies such as hybrid fiber coaxial cable and fiber to the home 
subsequent fcc orders have also relieved incumbents of the unbundling requirements for fiber to the curb loops  where fiber is extended to within feet of a customer premises 
the court also agreed with the fcc that ilecs need not provide line sharing 
however  the court vacated and remanded a number of other fcc rules promulgated in the original tro 
on february   the fcc released its order on remand  setting forth the final rules regarding the unbundling obligations of the ilecs in response to the court of appeals decision 
the fcc s revised une rules now state that clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to the une p combination comprised of local switching and une loop  or shared transport call related databases  or signaling networks used in connection with local switching 
in addition  the fcc found that clecs are not impaired at certain wire center locations in regard to high bandwidth ds and ds loops  dark fiber loops and interoffice transport facilities based on such criteria as the number of business lines and fiber based collocators within the wire center 
the fcc also set forth regulations that establish a mandatory transition plan to facilitate the transition by clecs from unes to alternative arrangements over either a twelve or eighteen month period depending on the une being eliminated 
at the end of the transition plan  the clec must have alternative facilities of its own or an alternative arrangement with the ilec under either a tariff or commercial agreement 
on february   a number of parties filed a supplementary petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia  again seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the fcc to follow the court s previous directive in its earlier remand decision 
the parties filing the petition claim that the final fcc rules are still flawed and not in compliance with the court s decision 
action by the court is still pending 

table of contents the final fcc rules regarding the unbundling of various network elements did not have an impact on our ilec operations  because we are not required to offer unes to competitors as long as we retain our rural exemption 
in regard to our clec operations  because we do not currently utilize line sharing and utilize our own switching for business customers that are served by high capacity loops  the elimination of these network elements had no effect on our operations or revenues from our existing customer base 
in july of  we executed a three year commercial agreement with verizon that has set the terms of the pricing and provisioning of lines served utilizing une p 
we currently provision of our clec access lines or of our consolidated access lines utilizing une p 
although the costs for une p will increase over time pursuant to the terms of the agreement  our relatively low use of une p and our ability to migrate some of the lines to alternative provisioning methodologies will limit the overall impact on our current cost structure 
with respect to the rules concerning access to unbundled high capacity loops  interoffice transport facilities and dark fiber  we have experienced moderate increases in the overall cost to provision such loops and facilities as a result of the fcc s order on remand 
the pa puc  which has the authority to set rates and terms for interconnection between carriers within the guidelines ordered by the fcc  revised many of verizon s unbundled rates for loops as well as high capacity circuits effective october although the revised rates reflect a mixture of both increases and decreases  based on the specific types of circuits and markets in which we operate  we have experienced an overall decrease in the average costs on a per line basis to provision our clec access lines located in verizon markets as a result of the pa puc action 
verizon challenged the pa puc s revisions to verizon s rates in federal court 
in august of  the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania ruled in favor of the pa puc  affirming the rates set for access to unbundled elements of verizon s network 
the positive impact of the pa puc revisions to verizon s rates have mitigated the negative impacts of the fcc s order on remand  with slight decreases experienced in in the overall per line cost to provision access lines in our edge out markets 
intercarrier compensation and universal service on february   the fcc issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking fnprm in regard to the rules governing intercarrier compensation for the various types of traffic exchanged by telecommunications carriers 
under the current rules  rates charged for traffic vary by the type and or the jurisdiction of the traffic 
the fcc is considering replacing the current system of payments with a uniform regime where all types of traffic are compensated at a unitary rate 
in that proceeding  the fcc is seeking comment on seven comprehensive reform proposals that have been submitted to the fcc from industry participants and other interested parties 
the fcc s goal is to put in place an intercarrier compensation mechanism that encourages the development of efficient competition  that preserves universal service support which ensures affordable rates in rural and high cost areas  that is technologically and competitively neutral and that minimizes regulatory intervention and enforcement and relies on commercially negotiated contracts rather than rules and regulations 
both north pittsburgh and penn telecom receive a large percentage of their revenues from intercarrier compensation payments  and the outcome of this proceeding therefore may have a large impact on their revenue streams 
in addition  because universal service funding will be affected by any change in the current intercarrier compensation system  north pittsburgh s universal service funding from both the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding 
on february   the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in regard to examining the regulatory treatment of voip 
while the fcc indicated its preference for minimal regulation  it also recognized the need to ensure that the provision of voip is consistent with social objectives including universal service  emergency  law enforcement access  consumer protection and disability access 
prior to the fcc s issuance of the nprm regarding voip  several companies had petitioned the fcc for declaratory rulings that their specific service offerings  which utilize some component of ip  were exempt from access charges 
in one case  the fcc ruled that access charges do apply to toll calls that originate or terminate on the public switched telephone network pstn even if some portion of the call is transported utilizing ip 
in the 
table of contents second case  the fcc ruled that voice calling services utilizing ip between two broadband connections to the internet and which do not utilize the pstn at either end were exempt from access charges 
while these two fcc rulings have addressed the applicability of access charges in regard to specific services that utilize ip to provide voice or toll calling services  various questions regarding the full scope of regulations that will apply to voip services in general are still unresolved and will be addressed in the voip nprm 
the outcome of this nprm proceeding will affect north pittsburgh and penn telecom because voip services compete directly with the local and toll service offerings of north pittsburgh and penn telecom  and both north pittsburgh and penn telecom receive a portion of their revenues from access charges  the applicability of which to various forms of ip traffic is being reviewed in the nprm 
as the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
in february of  the fcc also issued a fnprm regarding the possible reformation of the system for assessing and recovering universal service fund usf monies 
in that proceeding  the fcc has asked for comment on whether it should assess carrier contributions based on the number and capacity of connections that contributing carriers provide to customers  rather than on the current method  which is based on the interstate revenues they earn 
because the outcome of this proposal is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
other federal regulatory matters since february  the fcc has been considering the possible classification of wireline broadband internet access as an information service rather than a telecommunications service 
on june   the us supreme court supported the fcc decision that said cable broadband internet service was an information service and therefore free from most telephone rules  including the requirements to lease network access to competitors 
in response to the supreme court ruling  on august   the fcc adopted an order which determined that wireline broadband internet access services are information services and will therefore now be regulated under title i of the act 
the fcc also eliminated the requirement that wireline carriers offer the broadband transmission component of internet access on a stand alone basis to competitors 
the order does allow a wireline provider the flexibility to offer the transmission component on a common carrier basis  a non common carrier basis  or some combination of both 
the order also requires a one year transition period during which unaffiliated isps will be able to receive the separate transmission component on a grandfathered basis 
in addition  the order requires that facilities based providers of broadband dsl transmission services continue to contribute to the federal usf based on current levels of reported revenues for those services for a day period  or until the fcc adopts new usf contribution rules  whichever occurs earlier 
the order became effective on november  as a result of the order  north pittsburgh notified the fcc that effective april  north pittsburgh would begin offering broadband dsl transmission service on a detariffed common carrier basis 
this action will have little immediate effect on north pittsburgh s provision of its current dsl service offerings as the fcc order required a one year transition period during which north pittsburgh must continue to offer its current broadband dsl transmission services to isps at the same rates  terms and conditions that were in effect when the services were detariffed 
however  as a result of detariffing these services  north pittsburgh anticipates that it will be able to respond more quickly in the competitive broadband market by offering new and innovative broadband dsl transmission services at competitive prices to its customers without being burdened by the tariffing process 
state regulatory matters the pa puc regulates the rates  the system of financial accounts for reporting purposes  certain aspects of service quality  billing procedures  universal service funding and other aspects related to north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s provision of intrastate services 
in addition  the pa puc sets the rates and terms for interconnection between carriers within the guidelines ordered by the fcc 

table of contents price regulation effective january   under a statutory framework referred to as chapter  north pittsburgh moved from rate of return regulation in the intrastate jurisdiction to an alternative form of regulation  which was a price cap plan 
under north pittsburgh s price cap plan  rates for non competitive intrastate services were allowed to increase based on an index that measures economy wide price increases less a productivity offset 
there were no limitations on earnings under this plan 
the terms of the plan also allowed north pittsburgh to rebalance rates once each year to gradually realign its intrastate rate structure on a more rational cost and market basis in order to meet future competition 
in addition and pursuant to competition developing  north pittsburgh could file with the pa puc to declare certain services competitive and thereby be freed from all rate regulation for those services 
in return for approval of the alternative form of regulation  north pittsburgh committed to continue to upgrade its network in the future to ensure that all its customers would have access to broadband services 
the original chapter legislation expired due to legislative sunset provisions on december  on november   act was signed into law in pennsylvania 
act implemented new chapter legislation  which continued many aspects of the former chapter provision as described above but also added some options for ilecs in regard to alternative regulation 
under the new act  ilecs may commit to accelerate the deployment of broadband service capability to their entire service area and in exchange receive a reduction in  or elimination of  the productivity offset in their price index formula 
on february   north pittsburgh filed an amended alternative form of regulation and network modernization plan with the pa puc pursuant to act in that filing  in addition to modifying its prior chapter plan to comport with the new statute  north pittsburgh committed to accelerate its deployment of a ubiquitous broadband network throughout its entire service area from the previous commitment date of december  to december  in return for making this commitment  north pittsburgh will no longer be subject to a productivity offset when calculating the price stability index component of its annual price stability mechanism filing 
north pittsburgh will also not have to contribute to certain new public policy funding obligations that were instituted as part of act on june   the pa puc approved north pittsburgh s amended plan with no significant changes 
we believe that  based on the substantial investment we have already made in our broadband network  the capital expenditures necessary to meet the accelerated commitment date should not necessitate any material increases to the broadband portion of north pittsburgh s capital expenditure program from recent levels 
other state regulatory matters in addition to the pa puc s revision of verizon s unbundled rates previously discussed under the triennial review order and related matters heading above  there is another recent pa puc proceeding that could impact north pittsburgh and penn telecom 
on december   the pa puc adopted an order instituting an investigation regarding the intrastate access charges and intralata toll rates of rural carriers in pennsylvania  and the effect on those charges and rates if the pa puc were to reduce disbursements from the pennsylvania usf to the rural carriers or if it were to broaden the base of contributors to include carriers that do not currently pay into the fund 
the proceeding will also address the ramifications of recent changes to the pennsylvania public utility code set forth in act that affect access rate setting for both rural lecs and clecs 
under the act changes to the public utility code  the pa puc may not require a lec to reduce intrastate access rates except on a revenue neutral basis 
the new statute also sets limits on a clec s ability to charge intrastate access rates higher than the ilec s rates in the area in which they are offering service 
the procedures regarding the pa puc s implementation of these rate setting limitations will be determined in this access charge and usf proceeding 
this proceeding may affect both north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s ability to set access charge rates 
the proceeding also may affect the amount of funding that north pittsburgh receives from the pennsylvania usf and the amounts that north pittsburgh and penn telecom contribute to that fund 
a number of parties to the proceeding filed a petition asking that the pa puc delay any action in regard to the pennsylvania usf and intrastate access charges until such time as the fcc takes action in regard to intercarrier compensation issues 
on august   the pa puc adopted an order  which was entered on august   in which it 
table of contents granted a stay of the investigative proceeding for a period not to exceed twelve months  unless further extended by the pa puc  or until the fcc issues its ruling in its unified intercarrier compensation proceeding  whichever occurs earlier 
the stay renders the outcome of this proceeding unknown at this time  and we therefore are unable to determine the impact the proceeding may have on the revenues of north pittsburgh and penn telecom
