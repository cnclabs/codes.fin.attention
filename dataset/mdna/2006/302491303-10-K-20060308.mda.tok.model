item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified  global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets 
we operate in three business segments agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals 
agricultural products principal focus is on insecticides  which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests  and on herbicides  which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth 
specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture  structure and physical stability  pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis  specialty polymers and energy storage 
our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials  including soda ash  peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 
highlights was a year during which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments 
we also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax 
our liquidity position also continued to improve due to cash received in the amount of million related to the sale of a portion of the san jose  california property and million received as a result of the astaris asset sale in november additionally  we have continued to reduce our debt levels and refinanced our credit agreements 
consolidated revenue of  million was up percent from the prior year 
agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of  and  respectively 
in agricultural products  our focused strategy combined with growth in asia and continued strong performance in europe and brazil  led to an increase in revenue 
specialty chemical increases were driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in lithium 
industrial chemicals continued to benefit from price increases  particularly in soda ash 
income from continuing operations before income tax of million was up significantly from the prior year 
this was driven primarily by a gain in connection with astaris s sale of substantially all of its assets 
also contributing to the increase was a  and increase in operating profit in agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals  respectively  and lower interest expense levels 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of reduced debt levels 
offsetting these increases were higher restructuring and other charges and losses on extinguishment of debt 
outlook in  we expect continued growth in our earnings 
this increase is expected to be driven by higher selling prices in industrial chemicals  lower interest expense and modest growth in agricultural products and specialty chemicals 
we expect higher raw material and energy prices will partially offset these increases 
we expect that cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have described our accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have reviewed these accounting policies  identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical 
these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current conditions and other reasonable factors 
environmental obligation 
we provide for environmental related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate has been used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other  the lower end of the range has been used 
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa  or similar government agencies  are generally accrued no later than when a rod  or equivalent  is issued  or upon completion of a ri fs that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies 
estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management  as well as by financial and legal management and  if necessary  adjusted as additional information becomes available 
the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination  required remediation methods  and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 
our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances 
such costs principally include  among other items  ri fs  site remediation  costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan  fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort  and future monitoring costs 
estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies  specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as million at december  included in the environmental reserve balance and reasonably possible loss contingencies for are liabilities that are potentially recoverable from third party insurance policies 
these amounts have not been recognized as offsetting recoveries in  but are expected to be recognized in future years as applicable criteria are met 
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income  net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties 
such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves  we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible 
we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated  as well as the status of our claims against such parties 
although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty  the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site by site basis 
our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties 
we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects 
recoveries are recorded in environmental liabilities  continuing and discontinued 
impairments and valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and long term investments  goodwill and intangible assets 
we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of 
table of contents these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets  which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable 
the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices  volumes  costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 
we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates  discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period 
we performed this test in and determined that no impairment charge was required 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees 
the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions  including interest discount rates  healthcare cost trend rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees 
the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions  such as average retirement age  mortality  employee turnover  and plan participation 
to the extent our plans actual experience  as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics  differs from these assumptions  the costs and obligations for providing these benefits  as well as the plans funding requirements  could increase or decrease 
when actual results differ from our assumptions  the difference is typically recognized over future periods 
in addition  the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 
we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five year period 
we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements 
the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range  high or low  of the actual market value of assets  and is adjusted accordingly 
we recorded million  million and million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of million and million at december  and  respectively  which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders equity 
we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of million and million  respectively  for and in addition  we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of million and million  for and  respectively 
we paid other postretirement benefits  net of participant contributions  of million and million for and  respectively 
our estimated cash contributions for include approximately million in nonqualified pension benefits  approximately million in other postretirement benefits  and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately million 
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high quality corporate bonds  including moody s investors service  inc moody s aa rated corporate and industrial bond indices 
in selecting the discount rate for  we placed particular emphasis on a yield curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows 
the specific interest rates supporting the yield 
table of contents curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of high quality aa graded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan  we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries  including historical market returns  information on long term real return expectations by asset class  inflation assumptions  and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates 
we also consider the historical performance of our own plan s trust  which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately percent over the last years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors 
the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately percent equities us and us  percent fixed income and percent cash and other short term investments 
given an actively managed investment portfolio  the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio  using geometric averaging  and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately percent  is between percent and percent for both us and us equities  and between percent and percent for fixed income investments  which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions 
for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 
sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 
a one half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent increase in the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for this allowance  we have considered a number of factors including future income  the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides for the deduction for us federal income tax purposes of percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
during the year ended december   we repatriated million of earnings and capital of which approximately million were qualifying dividends under the ajca 
we recorded an income tax charge in of million associated with our total ajca dividends 
the charge includes million on the repatriation of the qualifying dividends subject to the percent ajca provision 

table of contents results of operations  and overview year ended december  per share diluted per share diluted per share diluted in millions  except per share data consolidated revenue net income net income included the following after tax charges gains restructuring and other charges gains astaris restructuring investment gains loss on extinguishment of debt cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations tax adjustments after tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges our share of charges recorded by astaris  the phosphorous joint venture prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets is included in equity in earnings loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income 
income for the year ended december  represents adjustments to liabilities related to restructuring and other charges recorded by astaris prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets 
investment gains include a gain in connection with astaris s sale of substantially all of its assets 
this gain is included in equity in earnings loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income 
we believe that the non gaap financial measure after tax income from continuing operations  excluding restructuring and other income and charges  and its presentation on a per share basis  provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts 
we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period 
this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
the after tax charges gains included in net income presented in the chart above can be found in the results of operations discussions below for compared to and for compared to see segment results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for  and results of operations compared to in the following discussion  year refers to the year ending december  and prior year refers to the year ending december  additionally  in the discussion below  please refer to our consolidated statements of income included in item of this form k as well as the after tax charges included in net income in the above table 
all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 
revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of percent compared to the  million recorded in the prior year period 
this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments  which are discussed separately below 
restructuring and other charges were million million after tax in compared to million million after tax in 
table of contents charges for the year ended december  primarily include the following million related to our decision on april  to close our copenhagen  denmark carrageenan plant and bezons  france blending facility in our specialty chemicals segment 
this amount consisted of i plant and equipment impairment charges of million  ii severance and employee benefits of million and iii other costs of million 
the plant and equipment impairment charge of million represents an adjustment to value this plant and equipment at estimated fair value less costs to sell 
we have reported the plant and equipment assets related to the copenhagen as assets held for sale 
the assets held for sale in the amount of million are included in other current assets on our december  consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to complete the sale of these assets sometime in the first quarter of impairment and shutdown charges of million on our spring hill  west virginia peroxygen plant 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an analysis of our idled spring hill  west virginia facility in our industrial chemicals segment 
as a result  we committed to the abandonment of the majority of the assets at this facility before the end of their previously estimated useful life 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with these assets and million of charges related to the asset retirement obligations associated with this site which were triggered as a result of our abandonment plans 
the majority of these obligations relate to one of the spring hill plants we plan to demolish 
additional restructuring and other charges for the year ended december  totaled million 
this amount primarily related to charges of million at our pocatello site to increase reserves for demolition and other shutdown costs as well as charges of million for the abandonment of assets in our agricultural products segment and severance charges which were recorded in our specialty chemicals million and agricultural products million segments 
the severance charges relate to approximately and people  respectively  most of whom have either separated from us as of december  or will separate from us in the first quarter of the severance costs are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies 
the charges of million that we recorded in were primarily a result of severance costs that are expected for result in improved cost efficiencies 
agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded million and million  respectively  of these severance costs 
severance costs in related to approximately people most of whom separated from us in we also recorded million of charges related to continuing environmental sites 
these charges were partially offset by non cash gains totaling million in industrial chemicals and million in corporate 
equity in earnings loss of affiliates equity in earnings loss of affiliates was million of earnings in versus a loss of million in the prior year 
the significant increase was primarily a result of million million after tax of earnings recorded in as a result of a gain in connection with astaris s sale of substantially all of its assets 
the increase was also a result of income at astaris up to the date of the asset sale versus a loss at astaris in the prior period 
the prior period loss included our portion of the astaris restructuring charges of million million after tax 
investment gains for the year ended december  was due to the sale of our equity method investment in sibelco 
we recorded a gain of million million after tax in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income 
interest expense  net decreased to million compared to million in the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decreases were due to our debt refinancing in october and june and the redemption of the percent senior notes in july loss on extinguishment of debt was million million after tax for the year ended december  compared to million million after tax in the prior period 
in  in connection with our 
table of contents industrial revenue bond refinancing  we incurred an approximate million loss and in connection with entering into the credit agreement  we wrote off approximately million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and million of fees associated with the new agreement 
additionally  in  we incurred a loss of million associated with the redemption of the percent senior notes 
the loss represents the unamortized fees from our credit agreement that were written off when we refinanced it in october provision benefit for income taxes was an expense of million in compared with a benefit of million in reflecting effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the change was primarily due to tax adjustments in which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the american jobs creation act ajca 
excluding the effect of these tax adjustments  which are discussed below  the change from to is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us  dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 
tax adjustments of million primarily includes charges of million associated with repatriations  net tax benefits of million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities 
tax adjustments of million of benefits primarily includes a tax benefit of million from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a december pronouncement from the internal revenue service irs  a tax benefit of million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of million resulting from a refund received from the irs 
discontinued operations  net of income tax totaled a gain of million in versus expense of million in net gain includes income of million related to completion of sale to the city of san jose  california of approximately acres of land used by our former defense systems operations 
primarily offsetting this income in was net environmental and legal charges of million 
discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
the charges in were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the epa and the primary responsible parties at the anniston site 
charges primarily include amounts totaling million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport  new york site 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income tax 
on december   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of million see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net income decreased to million in compared with million in primarily as a result of changes in the after tax items included in net income described above 
the change in these items was the primary driver behind the decrease in net income from to partially offsetting the decrease in net income in was higher earnings from our agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense 
other financial data corporate expenses increased percent to million in from million in the prior year  mostly due to higher legal expense and higher employee costs 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments  pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses 
other income  net increased to million from million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in the first half of 
table of contents segment results compared to information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
agricultural products year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit revenue increased percent versus the prior year  driven by stronger insecticide and herbicide sales in south america  asia and europe 
revenues in north america were lower compared with the prior year primarily due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition 
segment earnings were million  an increase of percent from the year earlier  as a result of the higher sales in south america  asia and europe and the favorable impact of manufacturing productivity initiatives  which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition in north america and higher raw material and energy costs 
in  full year revenue is expected to be relatively flat  as benefits of new products and label expansion are partially offset by the impact of lower north american bifenthrin selling prices due to continued generic competition 
full year expected segment earnings growth of to percent for reflects favorable sales mix and manufacturing productivity improvement partially offset by higher raw material costs 
a combination of lower commodity prices and a strengthening brazilian real is pressuring the cash flow of our brazilian customers who sell into us dollar priced export markets 
this has resulted in slower payments from these customers and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
specialty chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit revenue increased by percent versus the prior year  driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in pharmaceutical  polymer and energy storage markets for lithium 
sales in biopolymer were essentially level to a year ago as the timing of demand in the pharmaceutical and personal care markets offset increased demand in food ingredients 
segment earnings increased percent versus the prior year 
the strong lithium performance  improved results in the biopolymer food ingredients business and the benefits of biopolymer restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 
in  we expect low to mid single digit revenue growth in specialty chemicals  driven by improved biopolymer pharmaceutical sales and higher selling prices in lithium and biopolymer 
full year segment earnings are expected to grow by mid single digits as a result of the higher sales and continued productivity improvements 

table of contents industrial chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit revenue in industrial chemicals was million  an increase of percent versus the prior year 
higher soda ash sales accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices 
north american hydrogen peroxide and foret also benefited from higher selling prices during segment earnings of million increased percent versus the prior year  driven by higher selling prices across the group and improved earnings from astaris  offset in part by the granger soda ash plant startup expenses and higher raw material  energy and transportation costs 
prior to its divestiture in november  astaris contributed approximately million of income in  reflecting improved pricing  lower costs and the full year benefit of the restructuring completed in for  we expect full year revenue growth in the mid teens  driven by higher selling prices across most businesses  particularly in soda ash 
we also expect full year segment earnings growth of percent  driven by higher selling prices  partially offset by higher energy  raw material and transportation costs and the absence of astaris s earnings 
results of operations compared to revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of percent compared to the  million recorded in the prior year period 
this increase was driven by higher sales in all our segments  which are discussed separately below 
restructuring and other charges gains totaled a loss of million million after tax in compared to a gain of million million after tax in the before tax loss of million that we recorded in was primarily a result of severance costs that are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies 
agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded million and million  respectively  of these severance costs 
severance costs in related to approximately people  most of whom separated from us in we also recorded million of charges related to continuing environmental sites 
these charges were partially offset by non cash gains totaling million in industrial chemicals and million in corporate 
the before tax gain of million in was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of an office building in foret  our spanish subsidiary  offset by charges related to severance costs  asset abandonments and environmental costs 
equity in loss earnings of affiliates 
equity in loss of affiliates was million versus million in the prior year 
in  astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance 
the restructuring  which included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate stpp market  reduced fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and resulted in improvement in the venture s position in food and technical phosphates 
the restructuring was completed in and included four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three astaris sites 
our portion of astaris and restructuring charges  which totaled million million  after tax and million million  after tax  respectively  were recorded in equity in loss earnings of affiliates 
astaris s earnings improved during compared to the prior year due to the benefits of this restructuring 

table of contents interest expense  net decreased to million compared to million in the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs from the december and june term loan repricings  lower debt levels in compared to the prior year and the effect of our debt refinancing in october loss on extinguishment of debt in represents the unamortized fees from our financing that were written off when we refinanced our debt in october provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of million in compared with a benefit of million for reflecting effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the change from to was due to tax adjustments recorded in  the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us  dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 
the detail of the tax adjustments are explained further in our results of operations analysis compared to discontinued operations  net of income tax 
we recorded charges of million in versus million in charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance and legal reserves offset by gains related to tax adjustments for previously discontinued operations 
our environmental charges included amounts totaling million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport  new york site 
charges are primarily for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
net income increased to million in compared with million in reflecting higher earnings from our agricultural products and industrial chemicals segments and decreased interest expense somewhat offset by lower earnings in our specialty chemicals segment 
in addition  net income for and included certain after tax charges and gains which are separately described above 
reclassifications and adjustments see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on reclassifications and adjustments that impacted results for the year ended december  other financial data corporate expenses increased percent to million in from million in the prior year due entirely to higher spending related to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
other income and expense  net increased to million from million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and other non operating items  partially offset by an adjustment in pension expense 
segment results compared to information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
agricultural products year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit 
table of contents higher insecticide sales in accounted for over half of the revenue increase compared to this increase was driven by strong performance in latin america  particularly brazil  due to an improved farm economy and heavy pest pressures  and to a lesser extent improved performance in europe 
increased herbicide sales resulted from growth in brazil  new labels in europe  strong early season demand in north america and slightly improved conditions in asia 
favorable foreign currency effects  primarily from the stronger euro and payments from third party producers also contributed to revenue growth 
the increase in segment operating profit in compared to was due to higher sales  lower production costs and improved product mix resulting from our focus on higher value proprietary products 
specialty chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit the biopolymer business drove most of the revenue increase in with higher sales in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  primarily the euro 
revenue in the lithium business increased slightly in compared to as the benefits of increased sales into the battery market and favorable foreign currency translation were partially offset by lower sales into the pharmaceutical market 
segment operating profit was down percent in versus due to the impact of higher raw material costs and spending on biopolymer growth initiatives which were partially offset by favorable foreign currency 
industrial chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit the industrial chemicals revenue increase in was driven by improved foret sales  our european industrial chemicals business  which resulted from favorable foreign currency translation and higher selling prices in phosphates and peroxygens 
higher alkali sales in were driven by strong volume growth in export markets and improved domestic soda ash selling prices partially offset by lower net soda ash export prices in asia and latin america 
lower domestic peroxygen sales in resulted from an unfavorable product mix compared to and lower persulfate prices  partially offset by improved volumes 
the increase in segment operating profit in compared to was due to higher sales  and improved earnings at astaris 
these benefits were slightly offset by higher energy prices  primarily natural gas and higher freight costs 
astaris earnings improved significantly in compared to as a result of its restructuring

while the statute of limitations for does not close until june   because the irs audit for was concluded during and no questions regarding the spin off were raised during the audit  it appears that any liability for taxes if the spin off of technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by technologies  has been favorably resolved

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity  interest and currency exchange rates 
to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 
we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using third party software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date 
we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 
at december   our net financial instrument position was a net asset of million compared to a net liability of million at december  the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized gains in our commodity portfolio 
commodity price risk energy costs are approximately percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal  electricity and natural gas  and to a lesser extent  oil 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas and oil 
to analyze the effect of changing energy prices  we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december  and december  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of million in the net asset position at december  at december   a percent decrease in energy market prices would have resulted in a decrease of million in the net asset position and as a result would change the net asset position into a net liability position 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro  the euro versus the norwegian krone  the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real 
foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates  we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december  and december   with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 
table of contents million in the net asset position  and as a result  would have changed the net asset position into a net liability position at december  a percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of million in the net liability position at december  a percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of million in the net asset position at december  a percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of million in the net liability position and as a result would have changed the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december  interest rate risk one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in these agreements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
in  we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of million 
in  we terminated these swaps at a net cost of million and redeemed the underlying debt 
as of december  we had no interest rate swap agreements 
our debt portfolio  at december   is composed of percent fixed rate debt and percent variable rate debt 
the variable rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of foreign bank borrowings and variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and borrowings under our european credit agreement 
changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable rate debt portfolio in different ways 
based on the variable rate debt in our debt portfolio at december   a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased interest expense for by million
