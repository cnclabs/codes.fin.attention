critical accounting policies and estimates the company currently only applies judgment and estimates which may have a material effect on the eventual outcome of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses for impairment of long lived assets  accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and accruals 
the following explains the basis and the procedure for each account where judgment and estimates are applied 
revenue recognition the company reports revenues  net of sales incentives  when title passes and risk of loss transfers to the customer

impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
see goodwill below 
accounts receivable the company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis  primarily through distributors with which the company maintains long term relationships 
as a result  bad debt experience has not been material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears 
there can be no assurance that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will not develop financial difficulties and default on payment 
see consolidated balance sheets for allowance amounts

on an ongoing basis  component parts found to be obsolete through design or process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost 
the company reviews on hand balances of products and component parts against specific criteria

an inventory reserve is then established for the full inventory carrying value of those products and component parts deemed to be obsolete or slow moving 
see note to the financial statements for inventory reserve amounts 
goodwill the company acquired its korean operations in september using the purchase method 
as a result  goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
a valuation based on the cash flow method was performed at december  and december  it was determined that the value of the goodwill was not impaired 
there is no assurance that the value of the acquired company will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions 
see note to the financial statements for goodwill amounts

new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fas no 
fas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by fas clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
while fas enhances accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins  and clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage  the statement also removes inconsistencies between arb and international accounting standards no 
ias and amends arb to clarify that abnormal amounts of costs should be recognized as period costs 
under some circumstances  according to arb  the above listed costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
fas requires these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion 
this standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the impact of the adoption of fas on the company s reported operating results  financial position and existing financial statement disclosure is not expected to be material 
in december   the fasb issued fas no 
revised fas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fas fas r supersedes apb and fas  and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
this statement eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in fas as originally issued 
under apb  issuing stock options to employees at or above fair value generally resulted in no recognition of compensation cost 

table of contents fas r also requires that the company estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest and to revise the estimate as the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
this standard is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  fas r requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  thus reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in the periods after the effective date 
the company cannot estimate what these amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the company currently follows the disclosure only provisions of fas  and has elected to follow apb and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
the company uses the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees for disclosure purposes 
fas r requires that the company use the valuation technique that best fits the circumstances the company currently expects to use the modified prospective method whereby compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures using the black scholes valuation model 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date will be accounted for under the provisions of fas r 
the amounts reflected in note to the financial statements  are anticipated to approximate the effect of the adoption of this statement 
additionally  the company will recognize compensation expense related to the employee stock purchase plan  which has not previously been recorded 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  the company does not have any interest in variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
the company uses the equity method of accounting to account for its investments in sun china and whiteoak 
the company does not have a majority ownership in or exercise control over either of the entities 
the company does not believe that its investments in sun china or whiteoak qualify as variable interest entities  within the scope of fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 nor are they material to the financial statements of the company at december  seasonality the company generally has experienced increased sales during the second quarter of the year largely as a result of the order patterns of our customers 
as a result  the company s second quarter net sales  income from operations  and net income historically are the highest of any quarter during the year 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowed funds  which could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company had approximately million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  the company has managed this risk by its ability to select the interest rate on its debt financing at libor plus or the bank s base rate  whichever is more advantageous 
beginning in august  the interest rate on its debt financing will remain variable based upon the company s leverage ratio 
at december   a change in interest rates up or down would have affected the company s income statement on an annual basis by approximately  at the current  variable rate outstanding debt level 
at december   the company had million in variable rate debt outstanding
