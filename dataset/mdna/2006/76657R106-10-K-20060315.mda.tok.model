item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in risk factors  business and elsewhere in this report 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or such factors 
overview we are a leading provider of on demand software solutions for the customer relationship management market 
we offer a broad suite of solutions to address the customer service  sales and marketing requirements of large  medium and small enterprises 
we released our initial version of rightnow service in to address the new customer service needs resulting from increasing use of the internet as a customer service channel 
since then  we have significantly enhanced product features and functionality to address customer service needs across multiple communication channels  including web  interactive voice  e mail  chat  telephone and proactive outbound e mail communications 
we have also added several products complementary to our rightnow service solution  including rightnow marketing and rightnow sales  which automate aspects of marketing campaigns and sales operations 
in may  we purchased the assets of convergent voice  and added voice self service capabilities to our product portfolio 
to date  more than of our revenue has been generated by the rightnow service suite 
our client base currently consists of more than  active clients who in the year ended december  served more than million customer interactions  or unique sessions hosted by our solutions 
our solutions  whether sold pursuant to term or perpetual licenses  are available either on a hosted basis  where they are deployed in our co location facilities and accessed on demand by our clients  or on a non hosted basis  where our clients deploy them in their own facilities 
the percentage of our clients electing the hosted option was approximately for the years ended december  and  and for the year ended december  we distribute our solutions primarily through direct sales efforts and to a lesser extent through indirect channels 
sources of revenue our revenue is comprised of fees for term and perpetual licenses of our software  fees for hosting and support related to our licenses  and fees for professional services 
our term license agreements are generally two years in length  but can range from six months to four years  and include software and related upgrades  and hosting and support services over the term of the agreement 
the majority of our revenue in each of our last three years was derived from two year term license agreements 
we also offer monthly term license agreements that contain a minimum commitment period of at least months  are paid monthly  and include our software and related upgrades  and hosting and support services 
customers may also purchase perpetual software licenses  which are typically sold with annual maintenance contracts that provide software upgrades  and hosting and support services 
hosting and support services provide maintenance and management of our software at a third party facility  technical support for our software products  and unspecified product upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from consulting  education and development services  and reimbursement of related travel costs 
consulting and education services include implementation and best practices consulting 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
our software license agreements include capacity based fees  which are measured primarily by web pages served and user seats  and certain fixed fees 
a number of our agreements provide for additional fees for usage above established levels  which are billed and recognized into revenue when earned 
professional services  consisting of consulting  education and development services  are sold with initial license agreements and periodically over the client engagement 
the average deployment time for our clients is days 
we typically invoice clients for the entire amount at the beginning of the agreement with payment generally due within days for our term and perpetual license agreements  or due monthly for our monthly agreements 
our typical education courses are billed on a per person  per class basis 
depending on the size and complexity of the client project  our consulting or development services contracts are either fixed price fixed scope or  less frequently  billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 
we have also determined that our professional services a are available from other vendors  b do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria  and c qualify for separate accounting as we have sufficient experience in providing such services 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses ie bonuses  employee benefits and payroll taxes for our hosting  support and professional services organizations  third party costs and equipment depreciation relating to our hosting services  third party costs for interactive voice self service applications  travel expenses related to providing professional services to our clients  amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated overhead 
we allocate most overhead expenses  such as office supplies  computer supplies  utilities  rent  depreciation for furniture and equipment  payroll taxes and employee benefits  based on headcount 
as a result  overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
our hosting costs are affected by the percentage of clients who license our products on a hosted basis and the number of times our clients and their customers use our solutions  which we refer to as customer interactions 
as a result of economies of scale in our hosting infrastructure and declines in computer hardware and telecommunications costs  we were able to reduce hosting costs as a percentage of total revenue in  and  despite significant increases in the number of hosted clients and the level of customer interactions 
as our client base and solutions usage grows  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our hosting services  technical support and professional services 
we expect our professional services costs to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our professional services as a percentage of total revenue 
because cost as a percentage of revenue is higher for professional services revenue than for software  hosting and support revenue  an increase in professional services as a percentage of total revenue reduces gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
during  and  increases in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue resulting from economies of scale in hosting and technical support were partially offset by increases in professional services as a percentage of total revenue 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  product management expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time the related sale is invoiced to the client and we recognize the majority of our revenue from our agreements ratably over the terms of the licenses 
accordingly  we generally experience a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of corresponding revenue 
we expect significant increases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase the level of marketing activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  documentation and translation fees  quality assurance  testing and allocated overhead 
to date  we have not capitalized any software development costs because the timing of the commercial releases of our products has substantially coincided with the attainment of technological feasibility 
as a result  research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings 
to accomplish this  we plan to hire additional personnel and  from time to time  contract with third parties 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we seek to expand our technology and product offerings 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the growth of our business 
we anticipate that we will also incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and compliance with the requirements of a public company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of receivables and deferred tax assets  and accounting for equity based compensation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we account for our sales arrangements in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
the application of these sops requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  and whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for those elements 
customers may receive certain elements upon delivery or over time 
for example  under our sales arrangements customers typically receive the software license at the beginning of the term  and receive hosting and support services continuously over the length of the agreement 
under our term arrangements  revenues for the software  hosting and support elements are aggregated and recognized ratably over the length of the agreement because vsoe of the individual elements does not exist 
under a perpetual license arrangement  vsoe of the hosting and support elements does exist and therefore the license element is recognized immediately upon delivery using the residual method  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
changes to the elements in our software arrangements  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  and the fair value of the respective elements could materially affect the amount of our earned and deferred revenue our standard payment terms are net  although payment within days is considered normal 
we do provide extended payment terms in certain circumstances 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining whether our fee is fixed and determinable and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
changes in business practices for providing extended payment terms and or providing concessions following a sale  may effect our assessment of fixed and determinable fees and result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
valuation of receivables we regularly assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when applicable  a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainties regarding the realization of our net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  and deductible timing differences 
the uncertainty of realizing these tax benefits is based primarily on our lack of taxable earnings 
equity based compensation we account for our employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board option  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and we make pro forma disclosure regarding employee stock based compensation using the fair value method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf no 
 accounting for instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
in measuring the cost of equity based compensation  we make assumptions regarding our stock price volatility and the average expected life of our outstanding stock options 
our assumptions are primarily based on historical information  some of which was developed when we were a private company 
actual results could differ from our assumptions 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which replaces sfas and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
public companies are required to apply r as of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  r covers a wide range of share based compensation  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the statement requires the recognition of compensation cost related to share based payment plans to be recognized in financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we expect adoption of the provisions of r on january  will materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations because the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings 
we do not expect the accounting change to materially affect our liquidity because equity based compensation is a non cash expense 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no  exchanges of non monetary assets sfas  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges beginning in our first quarter of we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for changes and error corrections sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition guidance 
under sfas  changes are required to be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements unless it is impractical to quantify the historical effect of the change 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements

revenue per client improved due to the release of broader product and service offerings  and client purchases of additional capacity 
during we continued to invest in our operations by adding sales personnel to focus on new client acquisition  professional services personnel to support our solution offerings  and software developers to broaden and enhance our solution offerings 
overall perpetual software license revenue grew at a faster rate than total revenue in  resulting in an increase in operating income to of total revenue in from of operating income in we signed new customers in to bring our total active client base to more than  our annual customer retention rate in exceeded 
sales to clients with annual revenues greater than billion  and government educational clients  increased to of our total sales in  up from in for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million of cash in  and increased our deferred revenue to million at december  from million one year earlier 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
this deficit and our historical operating losses were primarily the result of costs incurred in the development  sales and marketing of our products and for general and administrative purposes 
we intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities  product development and business infrastructure 
during periods of investment and growth  because the majority of expenses are recorded as incurred and the majority of revenue is deferred  we anticipate that any growth in revenue will be largely offset by an increase in cost of revenue and operating expenses

new products introduced in recent years represented approximately of total sales in  and included sales of rightnow marketing  rightnow sales  and rightnow voice 
client interactions  a measure of the volume of unique sessions hosted by our software  grew approximately during growth in average number of clients occurred because of an emphasis within our sales organization on new client acquisition  combined with our plus client retention rate 
perpetual software license revenue increased in to million  up from million in the mix of perpetual license revenue may affect our profitability in any given period since it is recorded into revenue in full upon delivery instead of being ratably recognized into revenue over time  as is the case with term licenses 
we believe perpetual license revenue increased in because of the growing strategic importance of our products in client organizations  growing acceptance of on demand applications in the large business market segment  and longer client planning horizons 
professional services revenue increased to million in from million in average professional services revenue per client increased during  while average number of clients increased 
revenue per client increased in largely as a result of our focus on expanding services offered in conjunction with the broader product offerings 
we increased our professional services staff to employees at december  from employees at december  the mix of professional services revenue affects our profitability from period to period due to the lower gross profit earned on professional services as compared to the gross profit earned on software  hosting and support revenue

as a percent of the associated revenue  cost of software  hosting and support declined slightly in despite significant growth in the volume of customer interactions during the year  primarily due to economies of scale achieved in providing hosting and support services over a broader base of customers 
we intend to open a european hosting center and continue to increase our overall hosting capacity in professional services cost of revenue increased in to million from million in  primarily due to employee growth 
the average number of employees in our professional services organization was during as compared to in  which increased salaries and related expenses by million  and incremental travel and living expenses increased  professional services cost of revenue increased slightly to of the related revenue in from in new hire training requirements and customer scheduling of implementation can cause the cost of professional services revenue to fluctuate as a percent of revenue 
the professional services group often develops tools to assist with new customers installations  and as the tools become commonly used  they are typically transferred to the product group and incorporated into our software 
these tools might consist of connectors to other general use applications  and customization tools 
beginning in  we expect to transfer several such tools to the product group  resulting in a reclassification of the associated revenue from professional services to software  hosting and support 
this reclassification is expected to lower the margin on professional services activities 
consequently  we expect the cost of professional service to range between and of the related revenue in the future 
total cost of revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  over total cost of revenue of million for the cost of software  hosting and support increased to million in from million in the growth in costs was driven by staff additions which increased salaries and related employee costs by  higher third party hosting service costs of  increased equipment depreciation and amortization expenses of  and incremental third party costs of security monitoring and interactive voice self service of  the average employee count in our hosting and support operations was in as compared to in as a percent of the associated revenue  cost of software  hosting and support declined to in from in  primarily due to economies of scale achieved in providing hosting and support services over a broader base of customers

financial statements for prior years will not be restated to conform to the presentation 
we estimate the total compensation charge for will be approximately million  which will be recorded to each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
our estimate of stock based compensation is affected by our stock price as well as complex assumptions regarding our stock price volatility and the expected stock option exercise behavior of our employees 
actual stock based compensation expenses could differ materially from our estimate

interest expense declined in due to the pay off of our then outstanding debt in the third quarter of other income expense consists primarily of gains or losses on asset sales and foreign currency transaction gains or losses  which individually and in aggregate have been immaterial for the past three years 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  in  and  in  was approximately and of pre tax income  respectively 
the provision consists primarily of the federal alternative minimum tax  foreign withholding taxes  and various state income taxes 
our effective tax rate in and differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  federal alternative minimum taxes  foreign rate differentials  and non deductible meal and entertainment expenses 
the provision for income taxes in was  or of the pre tax loss for that year 
our effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our net operating losses and foreign tax credits not being realizable 
our effective tax rate in will depend on a number of factors  such as the amount and mix of stock based compensation expense to be recorded under sfas r  the level of business in state and foreign tax jurisdictions  management s expectation of the realization of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance  and other factors 
at december   we had million of net deferred tax assets that have been reserved in full by a valuation allowance 
in the future  if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets are realizable  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would increase either income or contributed capital in the period such determination was made 
if and when that happens  our effective income tax rate will increase to more closely approximate the federal statutory rate 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters through december  this information is unaudited but  in management s opinion  has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that our management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

we believe professional services revenue has generally increased as a percent of total revenue due to the expansion of our service offerings  but varies from quarter to quarter due to customer scheduling requirements  and training and education of newly hired personnel 
cost of revenue for software  hosting and support  as a percent of total revenue  trended slightly lower in the past eight quarters due to increasing efficiencies in our hosting and technical support operations 
the generally higher mix of professional services revenue causes professional service costs to be higher as a percent of total revenue 
the mix of term and perpetual software licenses sold in each quarter impacts our quarterly results of operations 
for example  in the quarters ended march  and  perpetual licenses represented a lower proportion of total revenue than in other periods  and consequently  income from operations was also lower in those periods 
we believe there are seasonal aspects to our customers purchasing behavior  which results in typically lower perpetual license sales in the first quarter of the calendar year 
sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollar costs  but have generally declined as a percent of total revenue during the past eight quarters mostly due to revenue growth 
for the quarters ended september   september   and december   sales and marketing expenses were lower as a percentage of revenue due to the timing of employee additions and marketing campaigns  and relatively lower commissions expense 
consequently  operating income in those quarters was unusually high 
we expect that during periods of investment and growth  because the majority of our revenue is deferred and the majority of expenses are recorded as incurred  any increases in revenue will be largely offset by corresponding increases in cost of revenue and operating expenses 
the amount and timing of our operating results generally will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our level of actual and anticipated business activities 
factors affecting quarterly operating results can include  but are not limited to our ability to retain and increase sales to existing clients  attract new clients and satisfy our clients requirements  changes in the volume and mix of term and perpetual licenses sold in a particular quarter  because perpetual license revenue is recorded into revenue upon delivery whereas term licenses are recorded into revenue ratably over the period of the license  our policy of expensing sales commissions at the time of invoice  while the majority of our revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over future periods  changes in the mix of revenue between professional services and software  hosting and support  because the gross margin on professional services is typically lower than the gross margin on software  hosting and support  changes in the mix of voice self service applications sold and or usage volume  because the gross margin on voice self service applications is typically lower than the gross margin on our sales  marketing and service applications  the timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  our ability to expand our operations  and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion  the cost and availability of hosting services at co location facilities  our ability to continue to realize efficiencies from our hosting and technical support operations  changes in the payment terms for our products and services  the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our clients  the rate of success of our domestic and international expansion  our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives and technical and sales and marketing personnel  costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies  products or businesses  seasonality in certain of our clients purchasing habits  and general economic  industry and market conditions 
our revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast and may fluctuate  and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
as a result  you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
we have experienced seasonality in certain aspects of our business  including lower perpetual license sales in the us in the quarter ending march  and increased purchasing when our clients fiscal years are ending 
our us federal government clients fiscal years end in september and most of our japanese clients fiscal years end in march 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  percent change percent change amounts in thousands deferred revenue cash provided by operating activities we have historically funded our operations with cash from operations  equity financings and debt borrowings 
in august we completed our initial public offering of approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the offering proceeds are invested in short term  investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments  totaled million 
in addition to our cash and short term investments  other sources of liquidity at december  included a million bank line of credit facility  under which there were no borrowings in operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   as compared to million of cash from operations in the majority of our cash from operations in and was from growth in deferred revenue  net income  and non cash charges  partially offset by growth in receivables 
we typically bill customers on net day terms at the beginning of the license period  which is reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
in periods of increasing sales  we would expect growth in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which  historically  has provided funding for operations 
a change in the billing practice resulting in delayed payment terms could have a material adverse effect on cash provided from operating activities and growth in deferred revenue 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable represented approximately and of current accounts and term receivables at december  and  respectively 
accounts written off in were constant as a percentage of new billings from the previous year 
we regularly assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual write offs could exceed our estimates and adversely affect operating cash flows in the future 
cash required for income taxes was  in and  in we do not expect to pay significant cash income taxes in  primarily because of the availability of net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized to offset taxable income 
investing activities provided million during  mostly due to the liquidation of short term investments  compared to requiring million in mostly for the purchase of short term investments
