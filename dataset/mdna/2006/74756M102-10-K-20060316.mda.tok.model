table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward looking statements  see forward looking statements and certain considerations contained in the introduction to this report 
overview we operate the largest dedicated bulk tank truck network in north america based on bulk service revenues 
reported in bulk transporter s annual gross revenue report the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all items shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists primarily of the shipping of chemicals  gasoline and food grade products 
we transport a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with value added services 
we extensively utilize third party affiliate terminals and owner operator drivers in our core bulk service network 
we are a core carrier for many of the fortune companies engaged in chemical processing  including the dow chemical company  procter gamble company  ei dupont and ppg industries  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers in the world with us operations 
we expect to grow as our customers continue to outsource more of their logistics needs to full service carriers 
over the last months  we implemented several major initiatives designed to enhance our operating flexibility  upgrade and standardize our business processes  improve our customer service and increase our profitability 
we increased pricing for all customers throughout the fiscal year by an average of 
we purchased or assisted in the transfer of several underperforming affiliates to refocus our efforts in targeted markets 
we terminated the affiliate arrangements with eight affiliates and assumed those affiliate s operations 
these transactions resulted in the purchase of million of tractors and trailers and million of goodwill 
in addition  we may convert additional affiliates to company terminals in the first half of we acquired a transportation company that is expected to contribute approximately million of additional revenue in we are installing and are upgrading a mobile satellite communication and tracking system 
we are expanding our transportation capacity by investing in new tractors and trailers through various methods  including purchases  capital leases and operating leases 
we are also providing tractors to owner operators and affiliates either through leases or outright sales of the tractors 
we strengthened our senior management team in and  including adding a new chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  vice president of safety  and general counsel 
we have realized  and believe that we will continue to realize  significant additional financial benefits from these and other strategic initiatives 
our revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  our market share  and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products are  in turn  affected by many other industries  including consumer and industrial products  automotive  paint and coatings  and paper  and tend to vary with changing economic conditions 
additionally  we also provide leasing  tank cleaning  transloading and warehousing  which are presented as other service revenue 
we also facilitate insurance products for drivers and affiliates through an 
table of contents independent third party 
the principal components of our operating costs include purchased transportation  salaries  wages  benefits  annual tractor and trailer maintenance costs  insurance  technology infrastructure and fuel costs 
we believe the most significant factors to achieving future business growth are the ability to a recruit and retain drivers  b add new customers and c obtain additional business from existing customers 
we expect our customers to continue to outsource more of their logistic needs to full service carriers 
our bulk service network comprises third party affiliate terminals and owner operator drivers in addition to company owned terminals and trucks 
we believe the judicious use of affiliates and owner operators results in a more variable operating cost structure because affiliates and owner operators are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue 
this structure provides us some protection against cyclical down turns  while providing superior localized customer service 
we continually evaluate our mix of affiliate and company terminals 
on december   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the vesting on december  of all unvested options  excluding options under the company s stock option plan the option plan with an exercise price of or higher 
this acceleration excluded all options held by our chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  and general counsel 
under the option plan  options generally vest ratably over four years from the grant date 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  approximately  options outstanding under the option plan became exercisable on december   of which approximately  are held by executive officers and members of the board of directors 
we did not recognize any expense in fiscal year as a result of the acceleration of vesting 
the purposes of accelerating the vesting dates were to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of sfas no 
r and the potential benefit to us and our shareholders in retaining the services of our directors  officers and employees 
absent this acceleration  we estimate we would have recognized approximately million as compensation expense for these vested options under fas r beginning january  through december  hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma appear to have had a relatively limited impact on our business in the physical damage to our facilities and those of our affiliates appears to be limited 
we estimate that our revenue was adversely impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita by approximately million and our pre tax earnings by approximately million 
on july   we sold certain assets of ppi including accounts  customer lists and insurance contracts 
these assets were related to the business of offering insurance to individuals who are not owner operators  affiliates and fleet owners doing business regularly with us qdi persons 
for the retained business  which encompasses on going transactions with qdi persons  we entered into a three year outsourcing agreement whereby the third party insurance brokerage company provides the administrative responsibilities for insurance related services offered to qdi persons 
we receive a percentage of certain commissions  underwriting profits  administrative and other defined revenues related to the outsourced administrative responsibilities for insurance related services 
we have retained certain claims of ppi including million of reserves  as of december   established on the uninsured policies identified during the investigation of irregularities at ppi 
operating results for the year ended december  include our orange juice transportation operations  which were sold in august the orange juice transportation operations generated million of revenues for the eight months ended august   and we also incurred million of start up costs and initial operating losses related to our entry into this business 
we also sold certain assets  primarily tractors and trailers related to the glass transportation business of levy transport  ltd  in august  these operations were not material to our operating results 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
annual depreciable lives are years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors and years for trailers  years for terminal equipment  years for furniture and fixtures  and years for other equipment 
tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service  and any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales of disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
we identified three reporting units transportation operations  insurance operations and mexican operations 
we allocated goodwill to the transportation operation as it principally resulted from the acquisition of chemical leaman corporation in if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill within the reporting unit is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed our annual assessment during the second quarter of fiscal year we used a combination of discounted cash flows and valuation of our capital structure to estimate the fair value 
projections for future cash flows were based on our recent operating trends 
if actual cash flows turn out to be significantly less than projections  then the impairment analysis could change  possibly resulting in future impairment charges 
deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
if  on the basis of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance 
since realization is not assured as of december   management has deemed it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
any change in the actual future results of operations could impact the valuation of the net deferred tax asset 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation estimates for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information 

table of contents accident claims reserves we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for property damage and million for workers compensation for periods after september  as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease  for cargo losses  and for pollution legal liability 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own risk management department personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss claims  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 
revenue recognition transportation revenues  including fuel surcharges  and related costs are recognized on the date the freight is delivered 
other service revenues  consisting primarily of lease revenues from affiliates  owner operators and third parties  are recognized ratably over the lease period 
tank wash revenues are recognized when the wash is completed 
insurance brokerage revenues are recorded as a contractual percentage of premiums received ratably over the period that the insurance covers 
we have recognized all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted by our customers 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators and affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain full time salaried employees and certain other employees under a collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current investment policy target asset allocation differs between our two plans  but it is between to for equities and to for bonds  and the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by gaap in the united states  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
based on the information provided by our independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable 
assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan 
at december   our projected benefit obligation pbo was million 
our projected net periodic pension expense is  a decrease in our assumed discount rate would 
table of contents increase our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense to  a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense to  a decrease in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would increase our net periodic pension expense to  a increase in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would decrease our net periodic pension expense to  new accounting pronouncements in april  the sec announced that the effective date of sfas no 
r  share based payments  has been deferred for certain public companies 
sfas no 
r  as amended  requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee equity incentives  are to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r will be applicable to us  beginning january   and we intend to adopt the standard using the modified prospective method 
the modified prospective method requires compensation costs to be recognized  beginning with the effective date of adoption  for a all share based payments granted after the effective date and b awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of the statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  and as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee equity incentives 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall liquidity 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be determined at this time because it will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of the statement would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share included in the stock based compensation table in note earnings loss per share 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current requirements 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we can not estimate what those amounts will be in the future as it depends  among other things  when employees exercise stock options and similar equity incentives  and no options have been exercised since such options were issued 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
also provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of error corrections 
this statement is applicable for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate any effects from this statement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to revenues 
transportation revenue increased by million or compared to the increase is primarily attributable to a rate increase and a increase in the number of drivers offset in part by a reduction in the total number of loads from the prior year 
the total number of miles was down slightly from the prior year 
the decreased load count was spread across our entire customer base 
other service revenue decreased by million or in versus this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues at our ppi subsidiary resulting from lower premium revenues after the sale of certain assets by ppi  a million decrease in revenues at our qsi subsidiary and a million decrease in tractor  trailer and other rental revenues 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million from as a result of higher fuel prices and volume increases 
we operated a total of approximately  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to  trailers and  tractors at december  the increase in trailers is primarily due to our purchase of new trailers during fiscal year while tractors and trailers of affiliates and owner operators remained relatively constant 
we expect to either purchase or lease additional trailers in operating expenses totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the million increase in purchased transportation resulting from increased fuel surcharges passed through to our affiliates and owner operators 
we pay our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue while we pay owner operators approximately of transportation revenue 
since we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  our purchased transportation costs will increase more as revenues generated by affiliates increase as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
our affiliates generated of our transportation and fuel surcharge revenue in compared to for the prior year 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue increased to versus for the prior year 
approximately of the fuel surcharge revenue is reflected in purchased transportation and was paid to our affiliates and owner operators during fiscal year while the remaining fuel surcharge is reflected in fuels  supplies and maintenance 
compensation expense increased million  or primarily due to the costs associated with transitioning to our new chief executive officer and management changes at our tank wash business  increased costs associated with the issuance of restricted stock since december  increases resulting from the addition of new senior management and incentive plans offset in part by decreases in payroll arising from the sale of certain assets of ppi and the levy glass division during the third quarter of fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million or due primarily to rising energy prices and increased maintenance costs offset in part by a decrease in costs associated with the sale of the glass business of the levy subsidiary 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  due primarily to certain trailers being transferred to held for sale in  which halts depreciation on those assets  as well as a number of assets becoming fully depreciated throughout and selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a million charge incurred in the period for environmental costs associated with the west caln township  pa site versus a current year net charge of million in environmental costs arising from increased costs at our bridgeport  nj location and our william dick  pa location offset by cost reductions at our tonawanda  ny location  a million decrease in relocation costs arising from the hiring of senior executives in and a million decrease in bad debt expense arising from improved collection efforts offset by a million increase in rental costs associated with our corporate facility

operating income increased million or compared to the operating margin for was compared to for as a result of the above items 
interest expense increased by million or in compared to as a result of higher libor rates and the issuance in january of new debt with higher overall interest rates which includes debt issuance costs as a component of interest expense but with extended maturity dates 
in the first quarter of  we wrote off million of debt issuance costs associated with the million partial repayment of our term loan using proceeds from the issuance of new debt in january other income increased by million due primarily to the generation of a million foreign transaction exchange gain in versus a million foreign transaction exchange loss in the provision for income taxes decreased by million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes

the revenue per mile change accounted for million of the transportation increase 
the increased demand from existing customers is a reflection of the gradual strengthening of the chemical industry as evidenced by a increase in revenue from generated by our ten largest customers 
other service revenue increased by million or in versus this increase was primarily due to a million increase in tractor  trailer and other rental revenues as a result of our converting company owned terminals to affiliates and a million increase in tank washing revenue 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in ppi revenues due to a decline in business volume after the irregularities were disclosed as well as the sale of certain ppi assets in july fuel surcharge revenue increased million or from as a result of higher fuel prices and volume increases

table of contents operating expenses  totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher purchased transportation resulting from increased revenue and the impact of several conversions of company terminals to affiliates during and as terminals are converted  we reduce overhead expense as well as fuel  supplies and maintenance expense and increase purchased transportation expense  representing the affiliates percentage of revenues 
this also accounts for the reduction in fuel  supplies and maintenance expense 
additionally  million of start up costs and operating losses related to our recently divested orange juice transportation operations were included in purchased transportation 
compensation expense decreased million  or 
the reduction is primarily due to a decrease of million as a result of converting company owned terminals to affiliates and the sale of the levy glass division

under the indentures governing the notes  in addition to specified permitted indebtedness qd llc will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis qd llc s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the respective indentures for the qd llc notes to consolidated fixed charges is to or less

we believe that  based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to fund anticipated 
table of contents capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including obligations under our credit agreement and satisfy other long term contractual commitments for the next twelve months 
however  for periods extending beyond twelve months  if our operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolver were not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures  debt service and other long term contractual commitments  we would be required to seek alternative financing 
these alternatives would likely include another restructuring or refinancing of our long term debt  the sale of a portion or all of our assets or operations or the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives were not available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  or were not permitted under our existing agreements  we might default on some or all of our obligations 
if we default on our obligations  including our financial covenants required to be maintained under the credit facility  and the debt under the indentures for the new notes were to be accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness  and we might be forced into bankruptcy 
other issues we have historically sought to acquire smaller local operators as part of our program of strategic growth 
we continue to evaluate potential accretive acquisitions in order to capitalize on the consolidation occurring in the industry and expect to fund such acquisitions from available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolver 
while uncertainties relating to environmental  labor and regulatory matters exist within the trucking industry  management is not aware of any trends or events  likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or the accompanying financial statements 
our credit rating is affected by many factors  including our financial results  operating cash flows and total indebtedness 
as a holding company with no significant assets other than ownership of of qd llc s membership units  qdi also depends upon qd llc s cash flows to service our debt 
qd llc s ability to make distributions to qdi is restricted by the covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the notes 
however  apollo as our controlling shareholder may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings or other transactions involving us that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment even though those transactions might involve increasing qd llc s leverage or impairing qd llc s creditworthiness in order to decrease qdi s leverage 
while the restrictions in the revolving credit facility cover a wide variety of arrangements that have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions  the revolving credit facility and the indentures may not afford the holders of the notes protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  restructuring  merger or similar transaction 
although qdi has no current intention to engage in these types of transactions  there can be no assurance it will not do so in the future if permitted under the terms of the credit facility and the indentures governing the notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our variable rate borrowings under qd llc s credit facility 
interest rates for the revolver are based  at qd llc s option  on either the administrative agent s base rate plus or upon the eurodollar rate plus  and interest rates for the term loan are based  at qd llc s option  upon the administrative agent s base rate plus or upon the eurodollar 
table of contents rate plus  in each case subject to reductions in the applicable margins for the revolver and term loan only if we reduce our total consolidated leverage below certain levels 
the base rate for the revolver is equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds overnight rate plus 
the base rate for our senior floating rate notes is libor plus balance at december  interest rate at december  effect of change in s in s revolver term loan senior floating rate notes total at december   a point increase in the current per annum interest rate for each would result in million of additional interest expense during the next year 
the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous one percentage point increase in the rates of all of our indebtedness and that the principal amount of each is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness is based  our various options to elect the lower of two different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar or cash flows 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to 
table of contents fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our inter company loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
in  hurricane  katrina  rita and wilma caused a rapid and dramatic rise in the cost of diesel fuel 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
in  a majority of fuel price fluctuations were covered through fuel surcharges
