competition web based interactive gaming and wagering is a new and rapidly changing marketplace 
we anticipate competition will become more intense as many web based ventures focus on the gaming industry 
management believes that we are well positioned to compete with these entities  as well as other established gaming companies seeking to enter the interactive  pari mutuel gaming market 
the television games network  operated by tvg  is a direct competitor in the domestic interactive pari mutuel gaming market and currently accepts wagers from customers living in twelve states 
the television games network tm is a hour national horse racing channel broadcast over cable and satellite 
customers receive a dedicated television set top box linked to the television games network s pari mutuel wagering system 
the television games network s web based wagering product was launched in the television games network has formed exclusive relationships with a number of major us horse tracks to broadcast their events 
in  magna introduced xpressbet tm  an online wagering platform which allows customers to place wagers online throughout north america 
we also consider several other companies offering interactive wagering to residents of the us to be viable competitors 
one such company  winticket 
com owned by americatab  has formed non exclusive relationships with many of the same tracks we offer 
other competitors include the racing channel  doing business as oneclickbetting 
com 
we believe potential new domestic and international competitors looking to enter the interactive wagering marketplace may include large established interactive and online software companies  media companies and gaming companies 
our business strategies may be influenced by the timing of a competitor s product releases and the similarity of such products to our products 
additional competition may result in significant pressure on our pricing and profit margins 
government regulation and legislation current licensing in december  the state of california horse racing board renewed both of our in state and out of state adw licenses through the end of terms for these two year licenses began on january  in june  the oregon racing commission approved our application to renew for one year our multi jurisdictional simulcast and interactive wagering totalisator hub license to accept and place online and telephone horse racing pari mutuel wagers 
also in june  the idaho state racing commission approved our application to renew for one year our multi jurisdictional simulcast and interactive wagering totalisator hub license to accept and place online and telephone horse racing and pari mutuel wagers 
in july  the washington horse racing commission approved our application for a one year adw license to accept and place online and telephone horse racing and pari mutuel wagers 
in november  the oregon racing commission approved irg s application for a multi jurisdictional simulcast and interactive wagering totalisator hub license to accept and place telephone horse racing pari mutuel wagers 
this license is subject to renewal in june and  if renewed  would be subject to renewal on an annual basis thereafter 
other government regulation and licensing gaming activities are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory control by federal  state and foreign agencies and could be significantly affected by any changes in the political climate and changes to economic and regulatory policies 
these changes may impact our operations in a materially adverse way 
our facilities are used by customers to place wagers and we receive commissions derived from such wagers  therefore various statutes and regulations could have a direct and material impact on our business and on the public demand for our products and services 
in  the interstate horse racing act was amended to clarify the legality of wagering via telephone or other electronic media and the commingling of pari mutuel wagering pools 
in september  us senator kyl circulated a proposed bill entitled the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of this bill would bar credit card issuers and other financial institutions from transmitting money related to online wagering 
the kyl bill sets out a specific exemption for the placing  receiving or transmission of a wager that is governed by and complies with the interstate horseracing act 
in november  us representative jim leach introduced a similar bill in the house of representatives 
the leach bill specifically exempts the interstate horse racing act of from its definition of unlawful internet gambling and has been referred to the house subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit for consideration 
us representative goodlatte recently introduced a bill entitled the internet gambling prohibition act  which has been referred to the house judiciary committee for consideration 
this bill also has a specific exemption from its coverage for the interstate horse racing act 
there is no indication at this time that either the house or the senate will act on any of these three bills 
other proposals similar to the kyl bill and the goodlatte bill could emerge in congress 
in the us  three states prohibit all forms of gaming 
from time to time  we receive correspondence from various governmental agencies inquiring into the legality of our activities 
we believe that our activities conform to those federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our activities 
however  we face the risk of either civil or criminal proceedings brought by governmental or private litigants who disagree with our interpretation of the applicable laws in the other states  and therefore  we are at risk of losing such lawsuits or actions and may be subject to significant damages or civil or criminal penalties 
many states have considered and are considering interactive and internet gaming legislation and regulations which may prohibit us from continuing to do business in such states  and anti gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws  regulations and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business 
any expansion into international markets may subject us to additional regulation in those countries into which we expand 
we believe that we can operate or license technology in numerous jurisdictions that allow telephone and account wagering 
however  we may not be able to obtain the approvals necessary to market our services in such jurisdictions 
world trade organization proceeding on april   the appellate body of the world trade organization  referred to as the wto  circulated its report in a dispute settlement proceeding brought by the government of antigua and barbuda  referred to as antigua  challenging certain us measures affecting the cross border supply of gambling and betting services 
antigua claimed that certain federal and state laws have the effect of prohibiting the supply of gambling services from outside the us in violation of certain us obligations under the general agreement on trade in services  referred to as gats 
in relevant part  antigua argued that the us was discriminating between domestic and foreign remote suppliers of wagering services for horse racing because the interstate horseracing act purports to exempt domestic service suppliers  like youbet  from the prohibitions of the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act  but does not exempt foreign services suppliers 
the appellate body of the wto found  inter alia  that the us has not shown  in light of the interstate horseracing act that the prohibitions embodied in 
the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act 
are applied to both foreign and domestic service suppliers of remote betting services for horse racing  and therefore  has not established that these measures satisfy the requirements of 
article xiv of the gats 
on april   the appellate body report was adopted by the dispute settlement body  referred to as the dsb  of the wto  and the us was requested to bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the gats 
pursuant to wto dispute settlement procedures  at a meeting of the dsb on may   the us government informed the dsb that it intends to comply with the rulings and recommendations contained in the report 
if it is impracticable for a wto member government to comply immediately  the member is given a reasonable period of time eg  fifteen months in which to do so 
on june   antigua requested that the wto appoint an arbitrator to determine the reasonable period of time for us compliance 
on august   the wto circulated the report of the arbitrator finding that the reasonable period of time for the us to comply will end on april  while the wto decision does not affect any existing federal or state law  we cannot predict what actions  if any  the us government will take in response to the request of the wto in light of the appellate body report and what effect  if any  the appellate body report will have on our business and operations 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we have never had a work stoppage  and none of our employees as of december  were represented by a labor union 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we believe our future success will largely depend upon our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial professionals and the continued service of our present senior management and key technical employees

risk factors our business faces many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may also impair our business operations or financial results 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business if it is determined that our business practices violate state gaming laws or regulations  we could be subject to claims for damages  fines or other penalties and may be prohibited from accepting pari mutuel wagers from these states in the future 
we currently have licenses in the states of california  idaho  oregon and washington to operate an adw multi jurisdictional wagering hub and or to accept wagers from residents of such states 
we also accept pari mutuel wagers from subscribers in other states where existing state laws purport to prohibit or restrict our ability to accept pari mutuel wagers from such states 
however  we believe accepting such wagers is permitted pursuant to the interstate horseracing act of  as amended  state laws  and certain other laws and legal principles and doctrines  including those contained in the us constitution 
however  state attorneys general and gaming regulators may interpret state gaming laws  the federal statutes and constitutional principles and doctrines in a narrower manner than we do 
if a federal or state court were to adopt such a narrow interpretation of these laws  we may face criminal or civil damages  fines or other penalties and may be prohibited from accepting pari mutuel wagers in one or more states in the future  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  if any proceedings were brought by governmental or private litigants who disagree with our interpretation of the applicable laws  the adverse publicity  cost of such litigation and diversion of management s focus and time away from our business operations may have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we have received correspondence from various state governmental agencies inquiring into the legality of our business activities and  in certain circumstances  alleging our non compliance with state gaming laws 
to date  we have responded in a timely manner to all of these inquiries outlining our legal position  which we believe permits our business operations in such states 
one or more of these state governmental agencies may not agree with our legal position or could institute proceedings against us that are intended to prohibit or restrict our business 
furthermore  many states have considered and are considering interactive and internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states  and anti gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws  regulations and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business 
the extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies 
such effects could be materially adverse to youbet 
if credit card companies  as a policy  refuse to process wagering account transactions due to perceived legal uncertainty surrounding online  live event wagering  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
credit card companies may in the future become hesitant to process deposits  fees and online transactions by our customers 
this would limit the methods of payment available to our subscribers  reducing the convenience of our services and may make competitive services more attractive 
this may adversely affect our business and our relationship with account wagering entities 
in september  senator jon kyl circulated a proposed bill entitled the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of  which would bar credit card issuers and other financial institutions from transmitting money related to online wagering 
however  the bill sets out a specific exemption for wagers that comply with the interstate horseracing act 
in november  us representative jim leach introduced a similar bill in the house of representatives 
the leach bill specifically exempts the interstate horse racing act of from its definition of unlawful internet gambling and has been referred to the house subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit for consideration 
us representative goodlatte recently introduced a bill entitled the internet gambling prohibition act  which has been referred to the house judiciary committee for consideration 
this bill also has a specific exemption from its coverage for the interstate horse racing act 
there is no indication at this time that either the house or the senate will act on any of these three bills  but if these bills are signed into law without an exception for legal pari mutuel wagers placed on horse races  their passage would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if the federal government or state governments impose taxes on wagers  our business or irg s business could be adversely affected 
if one or more governmental authorities successfully asserts that we or irg should collect taxes on wagers  it could adversely affect our business 
neither we nor irg currently collect taxes for wagers 
we and irg pay all applicable taxes to the state of oregon where one of our multi state hubs resides and is currently regulated 
however  one or more local  state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to tax online and internet wagering when a subscriber is physically within their jurisdiction at the time the wager is placed 
such taxes  if imposed  would have a materially adverse effect on our business and irg s business 
if our license and content agreement with tvg is terminated or is not renewed  and if we are not able to license such content directly from the track operators  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
tvg has formed exclusive relationships with a number of major us horse tracks 
because of tvg s exclusive relationship with certain horse tracks  in may  we entered into a license and content agreement with tvg 
pursuant to this license and content agreement  we have a non exclusive license to access the simulcast audio  video and data content  as well as the wagering pools  of these racetracks 
if our agreement with tvg is terminated or is not renewed  and if we are not able to license such content directly from the track operators  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
an adverse ruling on one or more claims in our arbitration proceedings with tvg could adversely affect our liquidity and operating performance 
we are involved in arbitration proceedings with tvg to settle a dispute regarding the amount of license and transaction fees payable to tvg from april  through and including march  and certain other matters under our license and content agreement with tvg 
on september   tvg filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association in delaware seeking monetary damages in the amount of approximately million  plus interest  and declaratory relief 
we intend to defend this action vigorously  and we also have asserted certain counterclaims and have sought declaratory relief under the license and content agreement 
the outcome of the arbitration and counterclaims cannot be predicted at this time 
if the arbitration resulted in an adverse ruling against us on one or more of tvg s claims  our liquidity and future results of operations could be adversely affected 
we face strong competition from the television games network and others 
we believe that our principal domestic competitor in the interactive  pari mutuel gaming market is tvg  which operates an adw website and the television games network tm 
the television games network is a hour national racing channel for distribution over cable and directv  along with an in home pari mutuel wagering system that requires a dedicated television set top box 
further expansion of the television games network s product and expansion of exclusive relationships may make it difficult for us to grow our subscriber base and to obtain quality racing content 
additionally  if exclusive relationships account for a significant number of horse tracks  tvg may be able to secure relationships with additional horse tracks on more favorable terms than us 
we compete with several other companies  including america tab  doing business as win ticket  xpressbet tm  a division of magna  and the racing channel  doing business as oneclickbetting 
com 
worldwide  numerous internet and other interactive ventures have been announced 
we expect to compete with these entities  as well as other established companies which may enter the interactive  pari mutuel gaming market 
it is possible that our current and potential competitors may have greater resources than us 
in addition  our license and content agreement with tvg purportedly grants tvg a royalty free and non exclusive license to use or sublicense any assignable patents  utility models or other patent rights  as well as any applications  provisional applications and continuations of such rights  owned or acquired during the term of the agreement by youbet or its affiliates 
if tvg were to successfully bring an action to the effect that the intent of the agreement covered assignable patents not integral to providing online adw services  we could face additional competition and not fully realize the benefits of such acquired patents 
any of the foregoing actions initiated by tvg could be time consuming and divert our attention and resources 
if  in response to allegations brought before the wto  the us government amends existing laws to exempt foreign providers of online gambling from  or restricts domestic service providers  our business could be adversely affected 
on april   the appellate body of the wto circulated its report in a dispute settlement proceeding brought by the government of antigua challenging certain us measures affecting the cross border supply of gambling and betting services in violation of certain us obligations under gats 
in relevant part  antigua argued that the us was discriminating between domestic and foreign remote suppliers of wagering services because the interstate horseracing act purports to exempt domestic service suppliers  like youbet  from the prohibitions of the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act  but does not exempt foreign services suppliers 
the wto found in favor of antigua  and the us was requested to bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the gats 
pursuant to wto dispute settlement procedures  at a meeting of the dsb on may   the us government informed the dsb that it intends to comply with the rulings and recommendations of the wto 
while the wto decision does not affect any existing federal or state law  we cannot predict what actions  if any  the us government will take in response to the request of the wto in light of the appellate body report and what affect  if any  the appellate body report will have on our business and operations 
if we are unable to retain our relationships with our content providers  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for the majority of our content  and if any one of those suppliers were to cancel its relationship with us  our business would be adversely affected 
recently  tvg filed a demand for arbitration against us with the american arbitration association alleging certain underpayments by us and certain breaches by us of our license agreement with tvg 
in addition  our right to simulcast and accept wagers on races at a number of the most recognized tracks and races  including the preakness  one of horse racing s triple crown races  is dependent on our license agreement with magna  which currently is subject to a one year agreement expiring december  the cancellation or non renewal of our license agreements with these content providers or the cancellation or non renewal of our agreements with a number of our other content providers would adversely affect our business 
if we or irg are unable to retain our core customer base or if we or irg fail to attract new customers  our business or irg s business could be adversely affected 
our sophisticated data mining software generates detailed customer segmentation analyses based on variables such as wagering propensities and preferences  which allows us to personalize our product offerings through targeted special offers tailored to specific customer segments 
we believe that these techniques help us to retain our best customers 
in addition  our marketing relationships with espn 
com  cbs sportsline 
com  the daily racing form and others help us attract new customers 
if we or irg are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features  if we or irg lose customers to our competitors or if we or irg fail to attract new customers  our business and irg s business would fail to grow or could be adversely affected 
the integration of acquired businesses  including irg and united tote  may result in substantial costs  delays and other problems 
our future performance will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses that we acquire  including irg  which we acquired in june  and united tote  which we acquired in february to integrate newly acquired businesses  including irg and united tote  we must integrate wagering operations and extend our financial and management controls such as compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and operating  administrative and information systems in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms and conditions 
we may not be able to successfully integrate these and other acquired businesses or realize projected cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated or at all 
furthermore  the costs of integrating irg and united tote could significantly impact our short term operating results 
these costs could include restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions  and non recurring acquisition costs  including accounting and legal fees  recognition of transaction related obligations and various other acquisition related costs 
the integration of newly acquired businesses will require the expenditure of substantial managerial  operating  financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of management s attention from our ongoing business concerns 
although we perform diligence on the businesses we purchase  in light of the circumstances of each transaction  an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses 
we may not be able to ascertain the value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses and their operations until we assume operating control of the assets and operations of these businesses 
once we acquire a business  we are faced with risks  including the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities  further regulatory approvals  the risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  the potential loss of key employees or customers  and the possibility that we may be unable to retain key employees or to recruit additional managers with the necessary skills to supplement the management of the acquired businesses 
if we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
system failures or damage from earthquakes  fires  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins or other unforeseen events could harm our business 
our business is dependent upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware  substantially all of which are located at a leased facility in woodland hills  california 
we have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages  system failures or damage  but we do not have duplicate geographic locations for our site of operations 
thus  our systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  hardware or software error  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website and our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site  and could permanently harm our reputation and brand 
these interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff  which  in turn  could delay our introduction of new features and services on our website 
we have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems 
however  this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
we may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner  which may cause customer dissatisfaction 
the gaming sector is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products 
our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead time in the market and our experience in operating an internet based wagering network 
however  we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater financial resources 
our success is dependent upon new product development and technological advancements  including the development of new wagering platforms 
while we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and product enhancement  we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner 
further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we were to lose the services of charles champion  gary sproule or other key personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy 
our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team 
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are critical to the overall management of youbet as well as the development of our technology  our culture and our strategic direction 
while our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are parties to employment agreements with youbet  neither of these agreements prohibits the executive from terminating their employment agreement 
our future success depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain and attract such employees 
our operating results and those of irg fluctuate seasonally and may be adversely impacted by a reduction in live racing dates due to regulatory factors 
we and irg experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to the seasonality associated with the racing schedules 
generally  revenues are greater in the second and third quarters of the calendar year 
we and irg carry a limited number of live racing dates and the number of live racing dates varies somewhat from year to year 
the allocation of live racing dates in most of the jurisdictions is subject to regulatory approval from year to year and  in any given year  there may not be the same or more racing dates than in prior years 
a significant decrease in the number of live racing dates would reduce our revenues and those of irg and cause business to suffer 
if the horse racing tracks that we or irg carry experience unfavorable weather  it may cause races to be cancelled which would reduce our revenues and those of irg and cause business to suffer 
because horse racing is conducted outdoors  unfavorable weather conditions  including extremely high or low temperatures  excessive precipitation  storms or hurricanes  may cause races to be cancelled 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  due largely to inclement weather  we carried fewer races at predominantly premier tracks  than in the fourth quarter of because a substantial portion of our operating expenses is fixed  a reduction in the number of races held or in the number of horses racing due to unfavorable weather would reduce our revenues and those of irg and cause business to suffer 
a horse racing industry controversy could cause a decline in bettor confidence and result in changes to legislation  regulation or industry practices  which could materially reduce the amount wagered on horse racing and increase our costs  and therefore  adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
a horse racing industry controversy could cause a decline in bettor confidence and result in changes to legislation  regulation or industry practices 
for example  on october   in connection with the breeders cup world thoroughbred championships held at arlington park in chicago  illinois  only one person placed winning bets on the pick  a bet to pick the winning horse in six consecutive races 
the bettor purchased all six winning tickets  valued at more than million  through an off track betting telephone system 
payment of the winnings was withheld when an examination of the winning bets revealed an unusual betting pattern 
scientific games corporation  the parent company of autotote systems  inc  later announced that it had fired an employee who had allegedly accessed the totalisator system operated by autotote systems  altered the winning pick tickets  and erased the record of his access 
the federal bureau of investigation conducted an investigation  and three individuals pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering 
industry controversy  like the pick matter  could result in a perceived lack of integrity or security  a decline in bettor confidence  and likely lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horse racing 
any such controversy could lead to changes in legislation  regulation or industry practices  which could result in a material reduction in the amount wagered on horse racing and in the revenue and earnings of companies in the horse racing industry  including us 
if our systems and controls are unable to handle online security risks  our business will be adversely affected 
we use packet filters  firewalls and proxy servers which are all designed to control and filter the data allowed to enter our data center 
however  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may make it easier for someone to compromise or breach the technology we use to protect our subscribers transaction data 
if such a breach of security were to occur  it could cause interruptions in service and loss of data or cessation in service to our subscribers 
this may also allow someone to introduce a virus or other harmful component to youbet causing an interruption or malfunction 
to the extent our activities involve the storage and transmission of information such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies might not be sufficient to reimburse us for losses caused by such security breaches 
risks related to our acquisition of united tote united tote s totalisator business is dependent on its relationships with its track and other partners for a substantial portion of its revenue 
the loss of all or a portion of these relationships could result in the failure of youbet to realize the expected level of revenue from its acquisition of united tote 
united tote has contracts to provide totalisator services to approximately tracks and other sporting venues that accept wagers  such as jai lai 
as a result  the success of our acquisition of united tote depends  in part  on our ability to maintain successful relationships with united tote s contract partners 
should these contract partners decide to discontinue purchasing totalisator services from united tote  youbet will fail to realize the expected increase in revenue from its acquisition of united tote 
united tote s totalisator business is dependent on the total amount of wagers placed with its track partners 
united tote s contracts provide that it will receive a percentage of the pari mutuel wagering pools for which it provides totalisator services 
as the amount of pari mutuel pools increase  united tote s revenues increase 
accordingly  a decrease in wagers placed at one or more of united tote s contract partners could cause a decline in united tote s and  in turn  our consolidated revenue as the owner of united tote 
further  any material reduction by any one of united tote s contract partners in its level of commitment of resources  funding  personnel  and interest in continued development of horse racing or other wagering based businesses could cause a decline in wagering and united tote s and our consolidated revenue 
united tote s totalisator business is dependent upon leading with and responding to technological changes 
united tote s success is dependent upon new product development and technological advancements  including the development of more advanced wagering terminals 
while united tote devotes resources to research and development and product enhancement  they may not be able to continue to improve and market existing products or technologies or successfully develop and market new products in a timely manner 
further technological developments by competitors may cause united tote products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we were to lose certain key united tote employees during our integration of united tote  our business would likely be adversely affected 
our future success may depend upon maintaining the continued service of certain of united tote s key management team and employees 
the members of united tote s senior management may be critical to our ability to foster a relationship with united tote s customers  to integrate united tote into our operations and to continue the success of united tote 
in addition  the development and manufacturing of united tote s products and computer systems requires highly skilled employees whose knowledge of those products and systems is integral to united tote s success 
if we were to lose certain of united tote s highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer service personnel  our business would be adversely affected 
risks related to the ownership of our common stock the share price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues  including broad market factors that may have a material adverse impact on our stock price  regardless of actual performance 
these factors include periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of our competitors  material announcements by us or our competitors  public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate 
under the ut group stockholder rights agreement  we agreed to a make whole provision pursuant to which we will pay to ut group a one time cash payment equal to the amount by which exceeds the average trading price of our common stock for the five trading day period ending on february   multiplied by the number of shares delivered by us and then held by ut group 
if the price of our common stock were to decline and ut group does not sell all or a substantial portion of their youbet shares prior to february   we could be required to make a substantial payment to ut group under this make whole provision 
if our quarterly results are below the expectations of securities market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may decline 
many factors  including those described under this item  can affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  which makes the prediction of our financial results difficult 
these factors include changes in market conditions that can affect the demand for horse race wagering  general economic conditions that affect the availability of disposable income among consumers  and the actions of our competitors 
if our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of securities market analysts and investors due to these or other risks  securities analysts may downgrade our common stock and some of our stockholders may sell their shares  which could adversely affect the trading prices of our common stock 
we have the ability to issue additional equity securities  which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of then existing stockholders equity interests in us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue  without vote or action of stockholders  up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  and has the ability to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of any such series 
any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock

item legal proceedings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we have not accrued for a loss contingency relating to the following proceedings because we believe that  although unfavorable outcomes in the proceedings may be possible  they are not considered by management to be probable or reasonably estimable  even in the form of a range of likely loss 
consistent with our accounting policy  we will record legal defense costs as period costs when incurred 
as such  we have not accrued for estimated future defense costs 
tvg arbitration in  tvg exercised its rights under our license and content agreement to verify the amount of license and transaction fees payable to tvg from april   through and including march  during this process  we attempted to correct a number of assumptions that we believe were erroneous and that were being used by the accounting firm retained by tvg to conduct the royalty exam 
the accounting firm s final report disclaimed any representations regarding questions of legal interpretation or any determinations of the relevance of specific documentation concerning the license and content agreement 
as such  the final report issued to tvg merely compared our historical payments during this period with the accounting firm s alternative calculations 
tvg  in turn  concluded that the accounting firm had identified underreported and underpaid amounts due to tvg under the terms of the license and content agreement  and demanded payment from us in the amount of  plus interest and the accounting firm s fees and expenses referred to as the monetary claim 
on september   tvg filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association in delaware seeking payment of the monetary claim 
in addition  and most notably  tvg is seeking a declaration that the tracks listed on schedule of the license and content agreement are tvg exclusive tracks for purposes of calculating tvg s license fees  despite the fact that the accounting firm noted that certain tracks were not tvg exclusive tracks even though they were included in schedule 
in its report  the accounting firm stated that based on discussions with 
tvg 



lone star park opted out of the agreement  and portland meadows  saratoga harness and suffolk downs did not consent to the agreement 
according to discussions with 


youbet as well as with 
tvg  neither youbet nor tvg consider lone star park  portland meadows  saratoga harness  or suffolk downs as tvg exclusive tracks 
in addition to the monetary claim and the declaratory relief described above  tvg is seeking certain injunctive relief based upon tvg s allegations that i we have violated the license and content agreement by accepting wagers on tvg exclusive tracks through a hub facility located in a state other than oregon specifically  our redundant and lower cost hub located in san mateo  california because it improperly deprives tvg of the ability to evaluate the potential legal  regulatory and financial ramifications thereof  ii we are not permitted to process wagers on tvg exclusive tracks through any wireless communications technology  and iii we are improperly allowing irg which accepts only live telephone wagers  and none via the internet  as permitted by separate contracts with its track partners to use streaming online simulcast and audio video content of live races conducted at  and to accept wagers on  tvg exclusive tracks 
in november  we filed our answer and counter claims to tvg s demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association 
the outcome of the arbitration and any such counterclaims cannot be predicted at this time and  accordingly  we have not changed our manner of calculating and paying the license and transaction fees due to tvg under the license and content agreement 
note and warrant litigation john p 
barbee  as trustee for the bankruptcy estate of jamie goldstein  filed a lawsuit against various parties  including youbet 
the litigation relates to youbet s march  issuance of a promissory note for  and a common stock warrant for  shares of our stock to the jg trust  an entity in which mr 
goldstein allegedly held a beneficial interest 
in  after mr 
goldstein filed a bankruptcy petition  we paid the note in full and issued shares pursuant to the warrant to various parties other than the trustee and the jg trust 
the trustee asserts that the note and the warrant are assets of mr 
goldstein s bankruptcy estate 
the trustee seeks various remedies against us  including i our payment to the trustee of  plus percent interest on that sum from march   together with the trustee s attorney s fees and costs  and ii a declaratory judgment that the trustee may purchase  shares of our common stock  at a price of 
per share  the exercise price provided in the warrant 
youbet is vigorously defending the litigation on various grounds  including  among other things  that i the jg trust properly assigned the note and the warrant  in whole or in part  prior to mr 
goldstein s bankruptcy filing  ii the note and warrant whether or not assigned do not constitute assets of mr 
goldstein s bankruptcy estate  and iii even if the note and the warrant were assets of mr 
goldstein s bankruptcy estate  the trustee cannot prevail on its claims  because we had neither actual notice nor actual knowledge of mr 
goldstein s bankruptcy when we  in good faith  paid the note and issued shares pursuant to the warrant

overview we have established ourself as a leading  global brand name for online pari mutuel horse race wagering 
to date  we have focused on the united states pari mutuel horse race wagering market through our main product  youbet express sm  which features online wagering  simulcast viewing  and in depth  up to the minute information on horse racing 
our customers receive interactive  real time audio video broadcasts  access to a comprehensive database of handicapping information  and  in most states  the ability to wager on a wide selection of horse races in the united states  the united kingdom  canada  australia  south africa  and hong kong 
we are working to expand the youbet 
com sm brand  its products  and its services throughout the united states and in select international markets 
in  our focus on long term value creation and profitable growth contributed to the following financial achievements year over year increase in income before income taxes from million in to million in  highest annual revenues in company history  with revenue growth of million  or  over including million of revenues from irg  which was not a consolidated subsidiary in  and strong cash flow generation of approximately million in cash provided by operating activities 
in addition to these financial achievements  we accomplished the following strategic objectives in to enhance long term shareholder value acquired irg  a privately held  pari mutuel account wagering company based in curacao  a netherlands antilles territory  under our ownership  irg became the first pari mutuel rebate provider to be licensed by a us racing regulatory jurisdiction 
the oregon racing commission granted irg a license to operate a multi jurisdictional simulcast wagering hub in oregon through its phone center in curacao  netherlands antilles 
established an independent wagering compliance committee to ensure the ongoing use of best practices in its internal gaming and pari mutuel wagering controls 
the committee is comprised of independent  outside experts in law enforcement  security  gaming and financial transactions 
continued to pursue expansion opportunities in various international markets to diversify our revenue sources and customer base 
in addition  in february  we acquired united tote company to realize further revenue diversification through new services  product opportunities and distribution channels 
as a result of our acquisition of united tote  we will begin operating as two reportable segments in  which we operate and manage as strategic business units 
reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
our reporting segments are based upon business units  one segment consists of the combined operations of youbet and irg  and the other consists of solely of the operations of united tote 
our reporting segments follow the same accounting policies used for our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and policies although our financial statements necessarily make use of certain accounting estimates by management  except as described below  we believe no matters that are the subject of such estimates are so highly uncertain or susceptible to change as to present a significant risk of material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
moreover  except as described below  we do not employ any critical accounting policies that are selected from among available alternatives or require the exercise of significant management judgment in their application 
revenues we record commission revenues and the related track and market access fees as operating expenses when wagers are settled  typically the same day as the wager 
other sources of revenue are relatively insignificant 
incentives offered to customers for them to wager on tracks that generate the greatest margins are deducted from revenues as are the volume discounts offered by irg 
pari mutuel racetrack operators typically retain a portion of all wagers as their commission prior to distributing payoffs to the winners 
in accordance with our agreements with tvg  magna and various independent racetracks  we receive a fee from each racetrack for wagers delivered to their respective pari mutuel pools 
in the aggregate  these fees represent our primary revenue stream 
we expect the majority of its future revenue to be in the form of fees from wagering 
we generate additional revenue from processing fees  monthly subscription fees and the sale of handicapping information 
intangibles licenses and patents are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated economic life or agreement term  whichever is shorter 
we amortize irg s customer list on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various customer segments  based on the quality of each customer segment 
we amortize the non competition agreements on a straight line basis over ten years  the term of the non competition agreements 
we re assess the amortization lives on a regular basis for potential adjustment 
internally developed software we capitalize internally developed software costs after the preliminary project stage is completed and until the software is ready for use 
under the provisions of statement of position  or sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has authorized further funding for the project 
the capitalization of software requires judgment in determining when a project has reached and concluded the development stage and the period over which youbet expects to benefit from the use of that software 
capitalized costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with the project  and interest costs incurred  when material  while developing internal use software 
capitalization of such costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended purpose 
we amortize capitalized software development costs using the straight line method over the expected useful life of the product  generally between two to four years 
we regularly review the carrying value of capitalized software development costs  and we recognize a loss if the value benefit related to the asset falls below the unamortized cost 
contingencies contingent liabilities are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies not meeting both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
we record legal defense costs as period costs when the related services are provided 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in december   the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost related to share based employee compensation transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
share based employee compensation transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
the provisions of sfas r are to be effective for us for the quarterly period ending march  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on cash flow 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirement for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles not prescribed by specific transition provision of the newly adopted standard 
it carries forward without change the requirements of opinion no 
for accounting for error corrections and changes in estimates 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for accounting changes made in the fiscal year beginning after december  we do not presently expect to enter into any accounting changes in the foreseeable future that would be affected by the adoption of sfas when it becomes effective 
results of operations for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december  revenues total revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase is partially due to  of irg revenue for the year ended december  that we did not have in handle for the year ended december  was  an increase of from the prior year 
this increase is partially due to  of irg handle included in the current year s total that we did not have in our blended yield  commission revenue less track and licensing fees each as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  as a percentage of handle was during  compared to during reflecting the impact of the lower yielding irg handle 
we generated a yield on youbet handle and a yield on irg handle 
the yield is a decline from the yield of due to a change in year over year track mix 
we believe that yield is a useful measure to evaluate operating results and profitability 
yield should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of youbet s financial performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
operating expenses track fees track fees increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to  of track fees associated with irg operations  which we acquired in the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in handle and revenues 
track fees primarily consist of amounts paid and payable to various tracks  the california horse racing board  and the oregon racing commission 
licensing  tvg for the year ended december   these fees increased to  compared to  for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to increased wagering on horse races at tvg tracks 
licensing fees represent amounts paid and payable under our license and content agreement with tvg 
network operations network operations expense increased to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to  of network operations expenses related to handle associated with irg that we did not have last year 
the remaining increase was primarily due to increased totalisator fees related to increased wager volume 
the increase was also due to an increased number of data center personnel and increased data center expenses 
network operations expense consists of costs for salaries  data center management  telecommunications  and various totalisator fees 
research and development research and development expense remained nearly unchanged in from the  incurred during we will continue to invest in the development of our network infrastructure and to support continued technology upgrades  which could increase our research and development expenses in the future 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was due  in part  to  of irg player services expenses that we did not have last year 
the remaining increase was primarily due to increased international and domestic business development efforts  increased marketing programs  including expenses associated with our cbs sportsline 
com and espn 
com agreements that we did not have during additionally  during  we incurred a  write off related to two international business development opportunities that we are no longer pursuing 
contributing to the year over year increase are certain player services costs that were accounted for in general and administrative during but are now accounted for in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists of costs for salaries  marketing and advertising  player services  and business development 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase of  includes  of expenses associated with the operations of irg that we did not have last year 
the increase was due to increased transaction processing fees related to the increased transaction volume  increased fully burdened salaries  and consulting expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sarbanes oxley compliance and other legal expenses 
additionally  certain player services costs that were accounted for as sales and marketing expense in the current year were accounted for in general and administrative in as we grow our business and expand our operations  we expect our general and administrative expense to increase  however  we believe that general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues will decline 
for  and  general and administrative expense as a percent of net revenues was  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in the current year includes  of amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the irg acquisition 
depreciation and amortization previously primarily consisted of amortization of licensing rights related to the tvg license agreement  which were fully amortized in may income taxes during  we determined that approximately  of youbet s aggregate  net operating loss carryforward should be recognized 
youbet s current growth plans potentially may include industry consolidation  acquisitions  international expansion  and expansion into other gaming businesses 
although we anticipate that all potential transactions will be accretive to earnings  we are aware of the risks involved with an aggressive growth strategy 
therefore  based on the current level of uncertainty  combined with our cautious optimism  we believe that it is appropriate to increase the deferred tax asset by  in results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues for increased to  compared to  for handle for increased to  compared to  for our year over year revenue growth outpaced year over year handle growth  in part  because youbet discontinued magna s call a bet service during in  youbet reported magna s call a bet revenue at the net commission rate of of handle while current commission rates range from to approximately on average 
also contributing to the higher revenue growth rate is the fact that youbet s customers  in aggregate  have shifted their wagering patterns slightly towards higher margin tracks and exotic wagers such as exactas  trifectas and superfectas 
exotic wagers generate higher commissions than win place show wagers 
our higher margin tracks primarily the tracks that are not subject to our agreements with tvg and magna accounted for of our commission revenues for the year ended december   an increase of over operating expenses track fees track fees increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to an increase in handle 
handle increased primarily due to increased marketing efforts and incentives offered to wager on higher yielding tracks 
licensing  tvg payments under our license agreement with tvg increased to  in  compared to  in primarily due to increased wagering on tvg tracks 
network operations network operations expense increased to  in  compared to  in this increase was due to the increased number of data center personnel  security upgrades and audio visual enhancements  partially offset by decreased totalisator and network connectivity fees resulting from lower rates 
research and development research and development expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to the capitalization of certain internally developed software costs in pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and also statement of position sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was due to higher business development expenses related to our efforts to diversify revenue sources  as well as  increased marketing  advertising and promotions programs  including  online media  radio  track promotions and our new national thoroughbred racing association and espn 
com relationships 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to an increase of  in employee costs which includes salaries  benefits  and performance related bonuses 
other increases included  retirement plan contributions  outside legal fees  a write off of expenses associated with our proposed american wagering  inc transaction that was withdrawn  and sarbanes oxley section compliance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in consulting and professional fees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased to  in  compared to  in primarily because the licensing rights related to the tvg license agreement were fully amortized by may depreciation and amortization primarily consisted of amortization of licensing rights related to the tvg license agreement 
income loss from operations in summary  income from operations for the year ended december  increased to  from a loss of  in  a  improvement over the prior year due  in part  to a substantial increase in revenues driven by growth in handle and incentives offered to our customers to wager on tracks with higher margins 
we will continue to focus on revenue growth through strategic marketing campaigns  technology advancements  and our ability to allocate handle to the highest yielding tracks 
other income and expense interest income interest income increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was due to increased levels of cash  improved cash management and reinvesting funds in higher yielding accounts 
interest expense interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  in in  youbet issued promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of  and recorded interest expense in the form of amortization of the note discount to the valuation of attached warrants 
as a result of an early redemption of these notes in december  youbet also recorded a one time cash interest expense of  attributable to the charge off of the then unamortized note discount recorded in in  our only interest expense was attributable to equipment leases and insurance premium financing which are not material 
other other income expense of  in was primarily due to the collection of previously written off accounts receivable and certain amounts received from the settlement of certain legal matters 
income taxes during  we determined that approximately  of youbet s aggregate  deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward should be recognized 
youbet s growth plans potentially included industry consolidation  acquisitions  international expansion  and expanding into other gaming businesses 
although we believed that all potential transactions would be accretive to earnings  we were aware of the risks involved with an aggressive growth strategy 
therefore  based on the level of uncertainty  combined with our cautious optimism  we believed that it was appropriate to recognize  of the deferred tax asset in liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our operations primarily with net cash provided by operating activities  in addition to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
as of december   we had net working capital of  including the current portion of our deferred tax asset of  compared to  including the current portion of our deferred tax asset of  at december  as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents   in restricted cash  and no debt from borrowed funds 
in february  we used  of unrestricted cash to partially finance the united tote acquisition 
our principal cash requirements consist of payroll and benefits  business insurance  real estate and equipment leases  legal fees  data center operations  and telecommunications 
in addition  the former owners of irg are entitled to certain earn out payments based on irg s future performance 
as of december   we had accrued approximately million of a maximum earn out payment of million  payable on or about august  the precise payment is subject to adjustment and continued performance through june  management believes that its on going efforts to contain costs and operate efficiently  combined with the growth in handle  has improved cash flow to a level that will support our operations 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may from time to time seek additional capital to fund our operations  reduce our liabilities and fund our expansion plans consistent with our anticipated changes in operations and infrastructure 
to raise capital  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt or convertible securities or seek to obtain credit facilities through financial institutions 
we have an effective shelf registration statement under which we may from time to time issue and offer debentures  notes  bonds  and other evidence of indebtedness  and forward contracts in respect of any such indebtedness  shares of preferred stock  shares of common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units  and stock purchase rights for an original maximum aggregate offering amount of million 
unless otherwise described in future prospectus supplements  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of securities registered under this universal shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes  which may include additions to working capital  the repayment or redemption of existing indebtedness and the financing of capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
cash flows for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was  for the twelve months ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the twelve months ended december  the year over year increase of  was primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses  income tax benefit  net income  and trade payables  track related  partially offset by a decrease in deposits and other assets  depreciation and amortization  other receivables  and restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  in the same period of the year over year increase of  was primarily due to the net cash paid in connection with the irg acquisition  restricted cash in connection with escrow deposits for the united tote acquisition  and increased purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase of  was primarily due to increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  partially offset by increased repayment of long term debt in as of december   and december   customer deposits totaled  and  including unremitted irs tax withholdings on behalf of customers of  and  respectively 
the  increase in customer deposits since the prior year end is primarily due to the inclusion of irg customer deposits 
similarly  accounts receivable increased  primarily due to the inclusion of irg customer receivables 
we are currently a party to the two legal proceedings described in detail under part i  item business legal proceedings 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  we have not accrued for a loss contingency relating to these proceedings because we believe that  although unfavorable outcomes in the proceedings may be reasonably possible  they are not considered by management to be probable or reasonably estimable  even in the form of a range of likely loss 
we cannot predict the cost of defense at the present time  which costs are recorded under our policy as period costs when incurred 
we intend to defend these proceedings vigorously 
in  we entered into capital lease arrangements totaling  and  in capital lease obligations will become due within the next months 
also  during the  we entered into operating lease arrangements totaling  and  in operating lease obligations will become due within the next months 
as of december   irg has a significant concentration of credit risk for their outstanding customer receivables 
in aggregate  irg s highest customer receivable balances accounted for  or  of irg s total customer receivable balance of  customer receivable balances will fluctuate  and pursuant to our policy  we periodically assess our receivables for collectability to determine the appropriate level of allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the balance of irg s allowance for doubtful accounts on customer receivables was cash flows for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was  for  compared to  for the year over year increase of  was primarily due to net income of  in  representing an increase of  from a net loss of  reported for this includes the effect of the decrease of  in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance applied to the current year pre tax income and a decrease of  related to depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  for the year ended december  the year over year decrease of  relates primarily to changes in long term restricted cash  which decreased  and an increase in equipment purchases of  in net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk and related changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our portfolio of investments included  of cash and cash equivalents and  of restricted cash 
our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents consists of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
the average yield on our investments was approximately at december  due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates
