we intend to amend our existing facility with lasalle by the end of the second quarter of the company believes that cash generated from future operations and cash and investments on hand  will be adequate to meet the company s current obligations including the investments in bridgefunds limited  and operating needs 
the company believes that the combination of its cash on hand  the cash generated from its franchising business  cash generated from discounting sources as well as its bank line of credit  will be adequate to fund its planned operations for critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of winmark corporation and subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies that we believe are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition royalty revenue and franchise fees the company collects royalties from each franchise based on a percentage of retail store gross sales 
the company recognizes royalties as revenue when earned 
at the end of each accounting period  estimates of royalty amounts due are made based on applying historical weekly sales information to the number of weeks of unreported franchisee sales 
if there are significant changes in the actual performances of franchisees versus our estimates  our royalty revenue would be impacted 
during  we collected  more than our estimate at december  as of december   our royalty receivable was  the company collects franchise fees when franchise agreements are signed and recognizes the franchise fees as revenue when the store is opened  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
franchise fees collected from franchisees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue in the liability section of our balance sheet 
as of december   our deferred franchise fees were  allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts and notes receivables 
we base the adequacy of the allowance on historical bad debts  current economic trends and specific analysis of each franchisee s payment trends and credit worthiness 
if any of the above noted items would be significantly different than estimates  our results could be different 
as of december   our gross trade and notes receivable were  and  and our accounts receivable reserve for these items equaled  this compares with an accounts and notes receivable reserve of  as of december  see notes to consolidated financial statements note impairment of long term investments on an annual basis  the company evaluates its long term investments for impairment 
the impairment  if any  is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices  discounted cash flow analysis or other financial metrics that management utilizes to help determine fair value 
judgments made by management related to the fair value of its long term investments are affected by factors such as the ongoing financial performance of the investees  additional capital raises by the investees as well as general changes in the economy 
during  the company recorded a  impairment charge in relation to our investment in eframe  llc 
see note income recognition leasing income is recognized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method of income recognition applies a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease 
when a lease is days or more delinquent  the lease is classified as being on non accrual and the company stops recognizing leasing income on that date 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at an amount that it believes to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our existing lease portfolio as of the reporting dates 
a provision is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the appropriate level 
if the actual results are different from the company s estimates  our results could be different 
the company policy is to charge off against the allowance the estimated unrecoverable portion of accounts once they reach days delinquent
