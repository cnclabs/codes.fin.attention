critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require substantial judgment on the part of management 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition  music publishing rights and music royalty accruals  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  equity instruments  and contingencies actual results could differ from these estimates 
certain of our critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and the effect that changes in management s estimates could have on our consolidated financial statements are further described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
in general  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
music subscriptions are paid in advance  typically for monthly or annual periods 
music subscription revenues are recognized on a daily basis over the subscription period 
revenues from sales of individual songs or albums by download are recognized at the time the music is delivered  digitally  to the end user 
revenues from pre paid cards and promotions are deferred and then recognized as i tracks are downloaded by the end users  ii if redeemed for a subscription  over the subscription period or iii when the company has no further obligation to provide services or refund the associated prepayments 
revenues from licenses of napster merchandising rights are recognized upon receipt of royalty reports from the licensee or on prepaid royalties when the company has no further obligation to pay royalties 

table of contents we have arrangements whereby customers pay one price for multiple products and services 
in some cases  these arrangements involve a combination of hardware and services 
in other cases  the customer pays a single price for multiple music downloads and months of music subscriptions 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate units in accordance with eitf consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
we have arrangements with certain customers whereby the customer provides goods or services to us 
our revenue and the charges for the goods or services provided by a customer are accounted for in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf  including subsequent interpretations 
the costs of separately identifiable goods or services received from a customer are valued at the cost we would incur to procure the same goods or services from a non customer third party 
if the goods or services cannot be separated  the total consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
consideration paid to customers under these arrangements that exceed the separately identifiable value of the goods or services provided would be reflected as a reduction of the customer s revenue 
we recognize revenue gross or net in accordance with eitf in most arrangements  we contract directly with the end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectibility risk 
revenue in these arrangements is recorded on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers  and we carry no collectibility risk 
in some cases  we pay operating expenses for the distributor and are reimbursed at cost plus a small mark up 
in those instances  in accordance with eitf  we report the revenue net of the amount paid to the distributor 
management exercises significant judgment in determining the fair value of multiple elements within revenue arrangements or separately identified goods or services and in assessing when prepaid cards or prepaid royalties no longer involve a future obligation 
these estimates represent our best estimates  but changes in circumstances relating to the products and services sold in these arrangements may result in one time expense or revenue charges 
music publishing rights and music royalty accruals under copyright law we are required to pay licensing fees for compositions embodied in digital sound recordings and for the sound recordings themselves that we deliver in our napster service 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory publishing licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations or arbitration with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to publishing rights for the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
we accrue for the cost of these fees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while napster bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and  as a result  could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 

table of contents capitalized software development costs internal use software 
we comply with aicpa sop no 
accounting for cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop  and eitf  accounting for website development costs 
in accordance with sop  software development costs incurred as part of an approved project plan that result in additional functionality to internal use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  generally three years 
software held for sale 
in accordance with sfas no 
 computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  development costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 
we have not capitalized any software development costs as technological feasibility is generally not established until a working model is completed  at which time substantially all development is complete 
management applies significant judgment when determining whether products under development are technologically feasible or whether it is probable that they will result in additional functionality 
these judgments include assessments of our development progress and expected performance 
additionally  the future realizability of capitalized software costs is subject to regular review by management  who consider expected future benefits 
the estimates of expected future benefits include judgments about growth in demand for our products  performance by our strategic partners and fair values for related services 
changes in these estimates could require us to write down the carrying value of these capitalized amounts and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from various means  including future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
the above process is computed separately for each of continuing operations  the discontinued operation and elements of other comprehensive income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of march   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  net of reversing deferred tax liabilities  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses and accrued liabilities and other provisions not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the timing of the reversal of the remaining deferred tax liability related to the election to step up the tax basis of the pressplay goodwill is indefinite 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents equity instruments we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 

under apb no 
 compensation expense is recognized based on the difference  if any  on the measurement date between the fair value of napster s common stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common stock 
the compensation expense is recognized over the periods the employee performs the related services  generally the vesting period of four years 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
management generally estimates the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
contingencies we account for contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 pursuant to which contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
management applies significant judgment when estimating probable amounts of contingent liabilities 
future negotiations regarding the contingent obligations could cause the ultimate obligation to be less than or greater than the amount estimated 
changes in these estimates could require us to take additional charges or benefits in future periods and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

the napster paid service was launched in the united states during october  in the united kingdom and canada during may and in germany in december since these launches  excluding the cyclical impact of university subscribers  our subscriber base has increased steadily 
total paid subscribers including university subscribers were  as of march  compared to  as of march  in fiscal  we expect revenues to be positively impacted as we begin recognizing revenue on prepaid cards for which the likelihood of redemption is remote and we have no further legal obligation to remit the unused value to the relevant jurisdictions 
in the long term  we anticipate that content revenues will continue to increase as a result of marketing activities and initiatives designed to continue subscriber growth  expand internationally and decrease customer churn 
hardware and license revenues increased approximately million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased hardware promotions in fiscal as compared to fiscal we anticipate that hardware and license revenues will fluctuate depending on the hardware promotions and licenses that we enter into each period 
geographic revenues the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the summary of our revenues from continuing operations year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended march  in thousands online music revenues north america europe total online music revenues the increase in revenues is related to the steady growth of the online music service in the united states and the launches of the service in the united kingdom and canada in may and germany in december we anticipate that the proportion of revenue outside of the united states will fluctuate as a result of continued marketing activities and initiatives focused on world wide customer growth and international expansion 

table of contents gross margin the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our gross margin from continuing operations year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended march  in thousands online music gross margin content hardware license total online music gross margin content gross margin is the profit from revenues after deducting the cost of royalties to content providers and publishers  technical support  bandwidth and hosting costs  depreciation and amortization of infrastructure assets related to the delivery of our online services  and any other direct costs of providing the services or products 
hardware and license gross margin is the profit from revenues after deducting the cost of hardware sold  order fulfillment services  product shipping costs and any other direct expenses related to hardware and license sales 
content gross margin increased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal in dollars  an increase of approximately to million from million 
this improvement is primarily due to the change in revenue mix from download revenues to subscription revenues  which have a higher margin  offset by additional ongoing expenditures for infrastructure to support our digital music distribution services 
hardware and license gross margins fluctuate based on the nature of the hardware promotions and the volume of trademark licenses in each period 
we also offer several product bundles  the revenues from which are allocated between content revenues and hardware and license revenues on a pro rata basis in accordance with eitf hardware and license gross margin decreased to in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to more negative margin hardware promotions in fiscal as compared to fiscal online service headcount dedicated to maintaining content and providing customer care was at march  and at march  we expect online music gross margins as a percentage of revenue to be adversely impacted to the extent that we continue to fund low margin promotions or spend to improve our online service infrastructure 
excluding one time items and low margin hardware promotions  we expect margins to be impacted negatively near term as label fees associated with portable music subscriptions increase 
we expect advertising revenues from the napster 
com free music service to positively impact gross margin in the future 
operating expenses we classify operating expenses as research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  stock based compensation  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees

research and development expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to additional headcount and contractors throughout fiscal that were hired in the third quarter of fiscal to work on the free music service  integration of the paid napster service with other technology platforms  such as xm satellite radio and wireless  and international expansion 
research and development headcount was at march  and at march  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase near term as we focus on the continued investment in new products and functionality 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  referral fees paid to marketing partners  other subscriber acquisition costs  as well as costs associated with advertising and promotions 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to million of additional personnel related charges associated with headcount added during fiscal and  and million of increased marketing program spending in fiscal the headcount increase is partially associated with our european expansion 
the increase in marketing program expenses is related to planned marketing programs in fiscal  including completion of the napster to go launch and marketing associated with the german launch 
sales and marketing headcount was at march  and at march  we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease over the next months as we continue to control spending and focus on lowering customer acquisition costs 
in the long term  sales and marketing expenses may increase due to advertising sales commissions 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  administrative outsources and other general corporate activities 
general and administrative charges for the continuing operations in fiscal include all corporate overhead charges that are not directly attributable to csd 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal personnel related costs decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal because of lower head count following the csd divesture in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  depreciation and facility expense decreased million as a result of the csd divesture and outside services increased  as the result of lower fees for sox compliance  offset by increases in legal expenses and other outsourced administrative services 
general and administrative headcount  including all corporate general and administrative employees  was at march  compared to at march  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat in the near term as we focus on controlling operating expenses 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense related to the intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of napster s name in december and napster  llc  formerly known as pressplay  in may amortization of intangible assets in operating expenses decreased approximately  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily because certain intangible assets became fully amortized during the third quarter of fiscal the remaining net book value of intangible assets at march  is zero 
unless we acquire new intangible assets  we do not expect future amortization expense 
loss from unconsolidated entity the  loss from unconsolidated entity represents our portion of the loss incurred by our japan joint venture during the year 
the joint venture was formed during october  and this loss represents our share of initial costs to form the company 
we expect losses from the joint venture to increase as it prepares for the launch of the napster service in japan in fiscal napster  llc has no obligation to fund future losses or provide contributions to napster japan other than the million net investment 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest income on our cash equivalents and short term investments  realized gains losses on short term investments  interest expense  change in the fair value of the hedge and other miscellaneous income

we expect other income  net to decrease in the future as investments are used to fund operations 
other income  net will also fluctuate due to foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents income tax benefit we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that deferred tax assets would be realizable in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
during january  following the divestiture of csd  which utilized substantially all of our tax operating losses  napster made a tax election to step up the basis in pressplay goodwill for tax purposes 
as a result  the pressplay goodwill is deductible for tax purposes  which creates a tax timing difference that is presented as a deferred tax liability and deferred tax expense 
as realization of this taxable temporary difference is not assured  a net tax expense related to this item is recorded 
income tax benefit decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the significant decrease in the tax benefit is due to the fiscal utilization of losses from continuing operations to offset income from the discontinued operations 
the fiscal expense represents primarily foreign taxes and the timing difference related to the pressplay goodwill 
in the near term we expect to continue to incur operating losses from continuing operations and no longer have income from discontinued operations against which we can offset the losses 
we are subject to various tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
our tax provision does not take into account any future benefit from loss carryforwards  which may be realized if we again achieve profitability and begin generating taxable income 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million in fiscal or a decrease of as compared to million in fiscal the income from discontinued operations in fiscal primarily reflects the million final after tax purchase price settlement with sonic for the sale of csd in december the income from discontinued operations in fiscal primarily included the million after tax gain on the divestiture

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions and  as part of our cash management process  we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions 
amounts deposited with these institutions may exceed federal depository insurance limits 
in addition  the portfolio of investments conforms to our policy regarding concentration of investments  maximum maturity and quality of investment 
some of the securities in which we have invested may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to reduce this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agencies securities  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
all of our short term investments mature in less than two years 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  commercial paper and municipal securities  which are not included in the table because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities in thousands  except interest rates 
maturing in total estimated fair value less than one year more than one year short term investments weighted average interest rate we have available to us a million revolving line of credit 
we had borrowed million against this line of credit as of march  the entire million  plus  of accrued interest  was paid in full during may we do not have any outstanding variable interest rate debt as of march  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and accounts payable

transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity are remeasured to the functional currency of the legal entity at the period end exchange rates 
any associated currency re measurement gains and losses are recognized in current operations 
for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period
