as a result  customers can add additional communication capacity through the addition of system components and connectors to keep pace with growing demands 
in addition  due to this scalable  modular design  customers can add additional omtool product servers to a configuration to provide failover redundancy  helping to ensure continuous operation 
we license our products on a combination server seat basis and as external hardware devices become more technologically advanced  we will extend a portion of our license fees to a device based model 
we will continue to focus on those vertical markets where regulations or business practices require confidentiality  timely electronic delivery and archiving of critical documents in electronic and paper format 
we expect to maintain an established position in our traditional market secure electronic document exchange primarily via fax 
in addition  we plan to continue the evolution of our accuroute product line  encapsulate the functionality of all our products into a single  configurable platform  expand our integration with complementary technologies such as document and records management tools  and to extend our document capture capabilities to continue to include compatibility with virtually all multi functional devices and scanners 
in this manner  we will pursue a leadership position in the broader document delivery routing and management market that we believe will grow in response to increasingly regulated communications and stringent privacy requirements 
we resell certain hardware products such as intelligent fax boards from third party vendors 
typically  hardware sales are a result of either new sales or sales to existing customers who are upgrading their it infrastructure 
occasionally  where our customers also want fax capabilities  we sell hardware products with our accuroute product 
we undertake these hardware sales as a convenience to our customers  who alternatively can opt to obtain hardware directly from a third party vendor 
the fax boards and fax modems that we resell are not functional without our product software and we are not generally in the business of selling fax boards and modems 
we purchase these hardware products as needed to ship to our customers and we typically maintain a minimal inventory of these hardware products 
service and other revenue has historically consisted primarily of the sale of support contracts to complement software products we license to our customers 
we generate a smaller portion of our service and other revenue from consulting  training and installation services 
we are focused on and are considering adding additional resources to increase our service and other revenue 
in fiscal year  we expanded our presence and penetration of the legal vertical market through the development of reference accounts and by proving accuroute s viability as evidenced by adoption of our accuroute product by over law firms 
in parallel  we built a firm base upon which to launch our accuroute product in the financial services vertical market 
during the second half of  we dramatically increased our sales and marketing spending  as called for in our strategic plan 
as expected  these investments in sales and marketing had no material impact on our revenue in  which was a near break even year 
going forward  our primary focus is to penetrate further targeted vertical and geographic markets  reaping the benefits of our sales and marketing investments 
in both the united states and europe  during  we will focus our accuroute sales in the financial services  healthcare and legal vertical markets through direct sales efforts 
in parallel  we will also expand our focus on distribution and reseller partners 
during  we will continue in fact accelerate our investment in sales and marketing and business development and we expect to start seeing the impact of these investments in growing our business during achieving quarterly profitability with these investments will require an overall increase in revenue 
we expect revenue to increase gradually during we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
total revenue net loss income software license revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change over same period of prior fiscal year or or or twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change over same period of prior fiscal year or or or during  we experienced an increase in our software license revenue as a result of continued market acceptance of our accuroute product 
we achieved this increase in overall software license revenue despite a ten percent decrease in our fax software license revenue from in as compared to the increase in overall software license revenue  however  was offset by declines in our hardware and service and other revenue  resulting in an overall decline in our total revenue 
the decline in our hardware revenue was due to a decrease in legacy fax product sales  which are the main driver for our hardware revenue  and an overall decrease in demand for our legacy fax products from existing customers who have upgraded information systems hardware in their worldwide locations 
the decline in service and other revenue was due primarily to a decline in our fax related maintenance support revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by increased overall service revenue from consulting services for the same periods 
in january  we entered into a new lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office space and plan to move our headquarters to this facility in andover  massachusetts in april the lease has a ten year term and we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five year term at the then applicable fair market rent 
under the terms of the lease  the landlord will provide us with a tenant improvement allowance of up to  additionally  we have a one time right to terminate the lease  upon twelve months written notice  after the sixth year of the lease term 
if we decide to terminate the lease  we must pay a penalty of six months rent and the unamortized portion of the tenant improvement allowance 
we believe the new facility will be suitable and sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future 
any decrease in demand for our products would likely result in decreased revenue  which would  in turn  have a significant negative impact on our financial results because a significant portion of our operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
as a result  our costs for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative could continue to increase as a percentage of revenue  thereby negatively affecting our operating results 
our future revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number and size of sales transactions we enter into with customers  the adequacy of provisions for losses  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenue from one or more large orders may constitute a significant portion of our total revenue in a particular quarter  further exacerbating fluctuations in quarterly results 
commencing at the end of the third quarter of  we increased the resources allocated to our united kingdom subsidiary  an effort that we expect will result in increased european revenue in future quarters 
although we believe that  over the last several quarters  there has been some improvement in the demand for enterprise software solutions and increased market acceptance of our products in europe  we cannot predict whether or when that market will soften or if market acceptance of our products will occur 
if the european market or the market acceptance of our products changes  we cannot predict whether and to what extent  the demand for our products will increase or decrease 
we have historically derived a majority of our total revenue from sales within the united states 
revenue from our european operations decreased during the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to a decrease in europe of sales of our legacy fax software 
we will continue to leverage our accuroute base in europe  as well as our indirect channel relationships in europe  to focus sales resources on the legal vertical market 
in addition  we have recently added new resources to our european operations  including a new managing director of europe  middle east and africa  which we expect will help to improve our results in the region 
there can be  however  no assurance that we will be able to increase international sales of our products and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition and results of operations

we then translate results generated by that entity into united states dollars and consolidate them with our domestic results for reporting purposes 
as we make sales to customers in a variety of countries  significant currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we manage our foreign currency exchange exposure by monitoring our net monetary position using natural hedges of our assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance that this policy will eliminate all foreign currency exchange exposure 
foreign currency exposure has not been material to our financial position or results of operations to date 
if the volume of our business denominated in foreign currencies increases  we may be required to use derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposure 
we will continue to leverage our existing distribution channels  where appropriate  to broaden our reach to our target vertical markets and further penetrate our installed base 
we are pursuing sales opportunities via our solution reseller channels  as well as focusing sales efforts on specific market segments  in order to facilitate acceptance of our products 
however  we currently have more of our sales resources focused on the direct model 
as a result  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from direct sales

the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our reported and expected financial results and business operations are discussed in appropriate sections throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our preparation of this form k required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements included herein and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves 
we derive our revenue primarily from two sources i product revenue  which includes software license and hardware revenue  and ii service and support revenue  which includes software maintenance and support  installation  training and consulting revenue 
we license our software products on a perpetual basis 
we generate revenue from licensing the rights to use our software products and sales of hardware directly to end users and indirectly through resellers 
our resellers order products from us based on purchase orders received from end users and do not order stock 
we generally sell our products to resellers and directly to end users without any specifically stated rights of return 
occasionally  however  in our sole discretion  we will accept a product return if the end user finds that the product does not fit its needs 
we also sell hardware products  which are provided by a third party  at cost plus an additional mark up  to end users and indirectly through resellers 
the hardware products that we resell are not functional without our software 
to support our software products  we sell software maintenance  support  installation  training and consulting services to end users and indirectly through resellers 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of multiple elements including software  hardware and service revenue 
we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  with respect to providing for potential future product returns 
as described below  we must make and use significant judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may have resulted in the amount and timing of our revenue if we had made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software products and hardware to both end users and resellers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products have been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns 
we recognize software maintenance and support revenue over the term of the related maintenance period  which is typically a one year period 
on those occasions when we sell multiple year maintenance contracts  we recognize the associated revenue over the multiple year term of the maintenance contract 
we recognize other service revenue as we perform the services 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision and acceptance is uncertain  then we will defer all revenue until the customer accepts the products purchased 
acceptance in these instances generally occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision tied to determination that our product meets published specifications and there are no uncertainties with regard to the customer s acceptance  then we will recognize revenue at the time of sale  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria previously mentioned have been met and the acceptance period is of short duration 
our transactions frequently involve the sale of software  hardware and related services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element under the residual method  in accordance with sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under this method  revenue is allocated first to all undelivered elements  such as services  based on the fair value of those elements  which is calculated to be the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
our services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software  as these services do not alter the capabilities of the software and do not carry a significant degree of risk to perform 
the amount allocated to the delivered elements  such as software license and hardware revenue  is the difference between the total arrangement value and the amount allocated to the undelivered elements 
if the delivered elements include both software and hardware  the amount allocated to hardware revenue is based on the price charged to us by the third party vendor plus an additional mark up  with the remainder allocated to software revenue 
to the extent that a discount is offered in the arrangement  the entire discount is allocated to the delivered element or elements 
if the delivered elements include hardware and software  the discount is allocated to the hardware and software based on their respective list prices 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order  a signed contract or a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond our normal payment terms  which are thirty to sixty days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we review dunn bradstreet credit reports for all of our resellers and adjust our credit limits with those resellers accordingly 
if a particular reseller does not have a favorable report or if we do not have enough credit information to determine if the reseller is credit worthy then we predominantly sell to those resellers on cash on delivery terms 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we maintain reserves for potential product returns and make adjustments to these reserves as needed based on historical product return rates 
we also consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products on the adequacy of these reserves 
our calculation of the estimated return reserve is based upon an account specific review of potential returns  where a return probability is known and an estimate based upon past historical returns as a percentage of revenue 
we must make and use significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the product returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may have resulted in the amount and timing of revenue for this or any prior period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
as with the product return reserve  we must make estimates of our ability to collect on our accounts receivable 
we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and these accounts do not bear interest 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis 
our calculation of the estimated accounts receivable reserve is also based upon an account specific review of potential uncollectible accounts  where a bad debt probability is known  and an estimate based upon past historical bad debts as a percentage of accounts receivable 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure to our customers 
our combined accounts receivable and product returns reserve was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
both components of calculating the estimated reserve specific identification and historic experience are material judgments that we make 
we base these judgments on historic trends  taking into consideration current business and economic conditions  which could change materially  thus changing the required reserve level materially 
the potential change to the size of our required reserve could be positive  in the event the reserve estimate proves unnecessary  or negative  if the reserve proves inadequate 
our deferred revenue is comprised mainly of revenue that is deferred for software maintenance and support contracts 
the other components of deferred revenue are amounts from sales transactions that were deferred because they did not meet all of the provisions of our revenue recognition policy 
software development costs 
we consider software development costs for capitalization when technological feasibility is established in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we sell software in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product introductions and changing customer needs 
accordingly  we have determined that we cannot ascertain technological feasibility until the development state of the product is nearly complete 
the time period during which cost could be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short and  consequently  the amounts that might be capitalized are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
therefore  we charge all software development costs to operations in the period incurred 
taxes 
we are required to estimate our income and state sales taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations  while also assessing differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes that result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accrued state sales tax liabilities 
we include deferred income tax assets and liabilities and accrued state sales tax liabilities in our balance sheet 
we assess our deferred tax assets for each reporting period to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will recover from future taxable income 
in making this assessment  we include assumptions regarding ongoing tax planning strategies 
we establish a valuation allowance for assets when their recovery is not certain 
we include changes to the valuation allowance as an expense or benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
we provide a full valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until we return to an appropriate level of sustained taxable income 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
if we are successful in generating sufficient future taxable income  we will reduce the valuation allowance through a reduction in income tax expense in the future 
we estimate accrued state sales taxes for each reporting period based on tax rates in effect for the reporting periods in each of the states where we have a potential nexus and for the time period during which we have that nexus 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine this liability are subject to change as they are difficult to measure or value 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our state sales taxes expense could be materially impacted 
we had a  reduction in the state sales tax accrual for the year ended december  this reduction results from the settlement of sales tax obligations with certain states at an amount less than what we had estimated 
a portion of this reduction is due to the fact that we received a refund from a particular state that we had previously settled state sales taxes in and we enrolled in the streamlined sales tax program in december  which relieved us from any past sales tax liabilities from twelve states in which we were not reporting state sales taxes and had estimated and accrued an amount equal to our potential sales tax liability 
as a result  we eliminated our accrual for these state sales taxes  as we are now required to pay applicable sales taxes only on a go forward basis for those member states of the streamlined sales tax program

and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

previously  apb no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements required the inclusion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
instead requires companies to recognize a change in accounting principle  including a change required by a new accounting pronouncement when the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions  retrospectively to prior periods financial statements 
we will assess the impact of a retrospective application of a change in accounting principle in accordance with sfas no 
if such a change arises after the january  effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
to require that companies record as an expense the effect of equity based compensation  including stock options over the requisite service period 
historically  we disclosed the effect on income that stock options would have had were they recorded as expense 
sfas no 
r also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required under prior standards 
the new rule applies to option grants made after a company s adoption of the standard  as well as options that are not vested at the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r a for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method that includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will implement sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and intend to use the modified prospective method 
we expect that the adoption will not have a material impact on our results 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after june  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue software license hardware service and other total revenue cost of revenue software license hardware service and other total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses loss income from operations interest and other income  net tax benefit net loss income gross profit software license hardware service and other fiscal years ended december  and revenue software license 
during the twelve months ended december   our total revenue was million  a decrease of approximately  from million for the twelve months ended december  however  our software license revenue increased by to million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to million in the same period in further  revenue from our accuroute product increased to million during the twelve months ended december  as compared to million during the twelve months ended december  this increase reflects the continued market acceptance of our accuroute product 
software revenue from our legacy fax product line decreased to million during the twelve months ended december  from million during the same period in  as we continue to focus our resources on the expansion of our accuroute product line and we experience diminished sales from our maturing legacy fax market 
various other components of software license revenue  including sales returns and allowance adjustments and sales of our other software products such as genidocs and swiftwriter  have decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  during the same period in during the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period during  the mix of products accounting for our revenue has continued shifting towards our accuroute product  as displayed in the table below  which table summarizes our revenue and particularly our software license revenue  by product category excluding freight and allowances for returns for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
total revenue software license revenue accuroute license revenue legacy fax license revenue other software license revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or or or or or during the twelve months ended december   our software license revenue represented an increased percentage of our total revenue  based primarily on the fact that hardware and services revenue declined during the twelve months ended december  when compared to the same period in software license revenue as a percentage of total revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year during the twelve months ended december  and  our license revenue from each of our major product lines and other components of revenue excluding freight and allowances for returns represented the following percentages of our total software license revenue accuroute license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue legacy fax license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue other software license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year included in our software license revenue for the twelve months ended december  and is a reduction of  and  respectively  in our sales returns and allowance reserve relating primarily to a general estimate based upon past historical returns for fiscal year and to the recovery of specific accounts that were previously written off and to specific accounts from fiscal year  where we determined that the risk of a return was no longer present 
although we cannot accurately predict the exact mix of products that we will sell in the future  we expect that software license revenue will constitute a larger percentage of our total revenue in the future if demand for our accuroute product  which generally does not require the purchase of additional hardware  continues to grow and if our accuroute product gains additional market acceptance 
hardware 
hardware revenue decreased during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to the twelve month period ended december  due to a decrease in sales of our legacy fax product  which sales are the main driver for our hardware revenue  and an overall decrease in demand from our existing customers who have already upgraded information systems hardware in their worldwide locations 
hardware revenue hardware revenue as a percentage of total revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or included in hardware revenue for the twelve months ended december  and is a reduction of  and  respectively  in the sales returns and allowance reserve relating primarily to a general estimate based upon past historical returns for fiscal year and to the recovery of specific accounts that were previously written off and to specific accounts from fiscal year where we determined that the risk of a return is no longer present and to the recovery of specific accounts that were previously written off 
we expect market demand for our accuroute product  which generally does not require our customers to purchase additional hardware  to increase and  if it does  we anticipate hardware revenue will constitute a smaller percentage of our total revenue 
service and other 
service and other revenue  which consists primarily of the sale of support contracts to complement software products we sell to our customers and  to a lesser extent  consulting  training and installation services  decreased in the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in fax related maintenance revenue for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the previous year as most of our historic service and other revenue is related to sales of our legacy fax product 
this decrease was partially offset by increased overall service revenue from consulting services for the same periods 
service and other revenue service and other revenue as a percentage of total revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or we are focused on improving the renewal rate of software maintenance contracts with our existing customer base in both our north american and european operations and we are focusing greater attention on generating additional service and other revenue in future periods 
cost of revenue software license 
cost of software license revenue consists primarily of the costs we incur in sublicensing third party software products  product media and product duplication 
cost of software license revenue for the twelve months ended december  decreased by as compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year 
the decrease is due primarily to decreased royalty payments associated with sales of royalty bearing products 
we have recently added third party software into our products and we expect that our software license cost as a percentage of software license revenue will increase slightly in the future 
we believe that these newly licensed third party software components will improve the capabilities and functionality of our products 
as a result of the decrease in the cost of software license revenue that we incurred during the twelve months ended december   we incurred an increase in our software license gross margin percentage as set forth in the following table software license gross margin twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year hardware 
cost of hardware revenue consists primarily of the costs we incur in purchasing third party hardware products 
cost of hardware revenue represented and of hardware revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred decreased costs related to hardware revenue due primarily to the decrease in our hardware unit sales 
further  our gross margin percentage for hardware sales decreased during this period due to a change in the mix of particular hardware products sold 
we do not expect significant changes in unit prices for fiscal year hardware gross margin twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year service and other 
cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of the costs we incur in providing telephone support  as well as other miscellaneous customer service related expenses 
the gross margin percentage for service and other revenue decreased to for the twelve months ended december   compared to in the same period in the decrease in gross margin percentage is due to an increase in wage related expenses and associated overhead costs of employees in the support department  as well as increased travel costs 
we do not expect any significant variances in our service and other gross margin percentages for fiscal year cost of service and other revenue gross margin for service and other revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  commissions and associated overhead costs  as well as the cost of marketing programs such as advertisements  direct mailings  public relations  trade shows  seminars and related communication costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased in the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the same period in  due to an increased number of employees in our sales and marketing departments and the associated costs of supporting those employees 
additionally  we increased our general advertising and consulting expenditures during the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
these expense increases reflect our initiative to further penetrate the legal vertical market with our accuroute product  as well as our initiative to target new vertical markets 
building on the success of the current version of our accuroute product within the legal vertical market since its introduction in  we intend to continue broadening our current sales and marketing strategy  which we began in the second quarter of  to encompass first the financial services vertical market and  thereafter  the healthcare vertical market 
in  we experienced some delays in investing the full budgeted amount for these initiatives due primarily to some delays in the hiring of our executive sales and marketing team  all of whom have now been hired 
during fiscal year  we will continue in fact accelerate our investment in sales and marketing and business development and we expect to start seeing the impact of these investments in growing our business during sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities 
these expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  associated overhead costs  consulting expenses and the cost of software development tools 
in the most recently completed fiscal year  our research and development expenses increased as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to an increased number of employees in our research and development department during fiscal year and the associated costs of supporting those new personnel 
research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or additionally  the increase in research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue is a result of an increase in consulting expenses in the research and development department during fiscal year as compared with the same period in we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional engineers and engage in more third party consulting arrangements to support our expansion of our accuroute product into other vertical markets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits for administrative  executive and finance personnel and associated corporate general and administrative expenses 
in the most recently completed fiscal year  our general and administrative expenses increased as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or the increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenue for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in is due primarily to an increase in management consulting expenses related to our initial compliance efforts with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  fees paid to our board of directors and wage related expenses 
this increase was offset in part by decreases in accounting and legal fees and by a  reduction in the state sales tax accrual for the year ended december  compared to a  reduction in the state sales tax accrual in each of these reductions results from the settlement of sales tax obligations with certain states at an amount less than what we had estimated 
a portion of the reduction is due to the fact that we received a refund from a particular state that we had previously settled state sales taxes in and we enrolled in the streamlined sales tax program in december  which relieved us from any past sales tax liabilities from twelve states in which we were not reporting state sales taxes and had estimated and accrued an amount equal to our potential sales tax liability 
as a result  we eliminated our accrual for these state sales taxes  as we are now required to pay applicable sales taxes only on a go forward basis for those member states of the streamlined sales tax program 
we expect that we will continue to experience slight increases to general and administrative expenses in the form of additional professional fees 
in addition  we expect fewer reductions  if any  to our state sales tax accrual 
we expect that consulting expenditures may be relatively flat in as compared to due to recent pronouncements from the securities and exchange commission delaying the applicability of section of the sarbanes oxley act of until at least the first fiscal year ending on or after july  for companies like omtool with public float of less than million 
interest and other income

we did not record an income tax benefit associated with any pre tax loss for the twelve months ended december  due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income 
we did  however  record  of tax benefit related to the true up of certain income tax accounts during related to the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a net tax benefit of  resulting primarily from a decrease in our estimated taxes payable as a result of a revised international transfer pricing agreement with our united kingdom subsidiary

cost of software license revenue was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost and improvement in gross margin is due primarily to the fact that we replaced certain third party software that was imbedded in our products with our own internally developed solutions  thus reducing the royalties that we must pay when a product containing third party software is sold 
as a result of the decrease in the cost of software license revenue that we incurred during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred an increase in our software license gross margin percentage as set forth in the following table software license gross margin twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year hardware

restructuring costs 
in the third quarter of  we announced a restructuring of certain of our operations and recorded a pretax charge of  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the charge included severance related costs associated with the workforce reduction  primarily in our domestic operations and costs associated with closing of our oregon office

during  we recorded a net tax benefit of  resulting primarily from a decrease in our estimated taxes payable as a result of a revised international transfer pricing agreement with our united kingdom subsidiary 
our fiscal year tax position also benefited from a  adjustment related to a transfer pricing adjustment related to fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded  of tax benefit due to a tax refund that our united kingdom subsidiary received during the first quarter of this subsidiary had incurred a loss for the year ended december  that resulted in an income tax benefit 
the tax benefit was carried back to prior years taxes paid and resulted in a tax refund 
because this subsidiary was undergoing an inland revenue audit for tax year  the realizability of this refund was not certain and therefore we did not record the benefit on its books until the audit was cleared and the cash was received  both of which occurred in the first quarter of we provided a tax provision of  for our united kingdom subsidiary based on the level of profitability that this subsidiary generated in fiscal year inflation during the fiscal years ended december   and  neither inflation nor changing prices have had a material impact on our net sales  revenue or income from continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources since  we have financed our operations primarily through cash flow from operations  private sales of preferred stock and common stock and our initial public offering of common stock completed in august as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash used provided operating activities investing activities financing activities twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  change from same period of prior fiscal year or or or our operating activities used cash of  for the twelve months ended december  and provided cash of  for the twelve months ended december   respectively 
we believe that the additional resources we are allocating to improve the success of our accuroute product in the legal vertical market and its expansion first into the financial services vertical market and  thereafter  the healthcare vertical market  will continue to put pressure on our earnings during  but that our existing cash is sufficient for at least the next twelve months 
net cash used during the twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of a net loss from operations  a decrease to the accounts receivable reserve and accrued state sales tax  combined with an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and offset by the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization and deferred compensation expense  decreases in accounts receivable and inventory and an increase in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
the decrease to the accounts receivable reserve relates primarily to an estimate based upon historical returns  which estimate demonstrated a reduced need for this reserve 
the increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of vendor payments 
the decrease to accrued state sales tax is a result of a reduction in the state sales tax accrual for the year ended december  resulting from the settlement of sales tax obligations with certain states at an amount less than what was estimated 
a portion of this reduction is due to the fact that we enrolled in the streamlined sales tax program in december  which relieved us from any past sales tax liabilities from twelve states where we were not reporting state sales taxes and had estimated and accrued an amount equal to our potential sales tax liability 
we therefore eliminated that accrual as we are required to pay applicable sales taxes only on a go forward basis for those member states of the streamlined sales tax program 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is due primarily to cash paid for an annual contract with a market research firm in connection with our increased sales and marketing expenditures  in accordance with our strategic plan 
the decrease to accounts receivable is primarily due to continued and successful efforts to expedite timely payments from our customers 
the decrease to inventory is related to a reduction in onsite hardware inventory and continued emphasis on shipments directly from our third party vendor 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily related to the increase in software maintenance contracts sold during fiscal year that complement our accuroute product  offset by a decline in the software maintenance contracts sold during the same period that complement our legacy fax product line 
net cash provided during the twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of a net profit from operations  depreciation and a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in inventory and a decrease to the accounts receivable reserve and decreases to accrued restructuring and accrued state sales tax 
investing activities used cash of  and  during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the sole use of cash for investing activities for each period was for purchases of property and equipment related to computer related software and hardware products

we intend to move our executive offices and headquarters to this new space in april we expect that we will increase our investments in computer related software and hardware products in as we improve our information technology infrastructure as part of this relocation 
financing activities provided cash of  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided for the twelve months ended december  was due primarily to the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock purchase program and employee exercises of stock options 
cash provided for the twelve months ended december  was due to the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
on march   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  in a private placement to institutional and other accredited investors 
the proceeds of that private placement  which totaled million  are being used for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the cash we received on the consummation of this private placement was offset by our usage of million in cash during the twelve months ended december   when we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock from asa international ltd  an existing shareholder  in a private transaction at a price of per share 
we repurchased those shares from asa international ltd 
with generally available corporate funds and we hold those shares in treasury 
based on our performance for the twelve months ended december  and current expectations for fiscal year  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balance  as well as the cash expected to be generated from operations during  will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next twelve months 
we expect that principal uses of cash will be for operations  working capital  payment of sales taxes  purchases of property and equipment and payment of certain leasehold improvements resulting from our move to andover  massachusetts 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all
