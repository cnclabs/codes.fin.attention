the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview plx was founded in  and between and we focused on development of i o interface semiconductors and related software and development tools that are used in systems incorporating the pci standard 
in and  a significant portion of our revenues were derived from the sale of semiconductor devices that perform similar functions as our current products  except they were based on a variety of industry standards 
our revenues since have been derived predominantly from the sale of semiconductor devices based on the pci standard to a large number of customers in a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging  industrial and other embedded applications as well as in related adapter cards 
in  we shifted the majority of our development efforts to pci express 
in september  we began shipping products based on the pci express standard for next generation systems 
we generate less than of our net revenues from sales of our software and hardware design kits 
in may  we acquired hint corporation which markets and sells pci bridges and pci x products into a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  personal computer peripheral  imaging  industrial and other embedded applications 
beginning with the quarter ended june   our operating results include results of hint corporation and its products 
in may  we acquired netchip technology  inc which markets and sells usb device controllers used in a range of business and consumer applications  including printers  wireless lan adapters  personal video recorders  and digital camcorders 
beginning with the quarter ended june   our operating results include results of netchip technology  inc and its products 
we utilize a fabless semiconductor business model whereby we purchase wafers and packaged and tested semiconductor devices from independent manufacturing foundries 
this approach allows us to focus on defining  developing  and marketing our products and eliminates the need for us to invest large amounts of capital in manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory 
we rely on a combination of direct sales personnel and distributors and manufacturers representatives throughout the world to sell a significant portion of our products 
we pay manufacturers representatives a commission on sales while we sell products to distributors at a discount from the selling price 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of title passage 
recognition of sales to distributors  including international distributors  is deferred until the product is resold by the distributors to their customers 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our gross margins have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to changes in product and customer mix  write downs and recoveries of excess or obsolete inventory  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  and specific product manufacturing costs 
the time period between initial customer evaluation and design completion can range from six to twelve months or more 
furthermore  there is typically an additional six to twelve month or greater period after design completion before a customer requests volume production of our products 
due to the variability and length of these design cycles and variable demand from customers  we may experience significant fluctuations in new orders from month to month 
in addition  we typically make inventory purchases prior to receiving customer orders 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results for that quarter and potentially future quarters would be materially and adversely affected 
our long term success will depend on our ability to introduce new products 
while new products typically generate little or no revenues during the first twelve months following their introduction  our revenues in subsequent periods depend upon these new products 
due to the lengthy sales cycle and additional time before our customers request volume production  significant revenues from our new products typically occur twelve to twenty four months after product introduction 
as a result  revenues from newly introduced products have  in the past  produced a small percentage of our total revenues in the year the product was introduced 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues 
results of operations the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods shown 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development amortization and write down of purchased intangible assets total operating expenses operating loss interest income and other  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss comparison of years ended december    and net revenues 
net revenues consist of product revenues generated principally by sales of our semiconductor devices 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to sales of our next generation pci express products as a result of the general market adoption of the pci express standard  partially offset by lower sales of our pci i o devices and usb products 
for the twelve months ended december   sales of our pci i o devices  usb products and pci express products accounted for  and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   sales of our pci i o devices  usb products and pci express products accounted for  and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
we continue to generate significant revenues from asia 
for the twelve months ended december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of net revenues were generated from asia 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of net revenues was derived from sales to one distributor  metatech 
the increase is primarily due to higher pci express product sales and increased sales in asia 
no other distributor or direct customer represented greater than of net revenues in and we generate less than of our net revenues from software and hardware design kits 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million or to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to sales of our usb products acquired as part of the netchip technology  inc acquisition which was completed in may  as well as higher unit shipments of our pci i o devices 
for the year ended december   approximately of net revenue was derived from sales to one distributor  metatech 
no other distributor or direct customer represented greater than of net revenues 
customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
our revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for product to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter  also called turns fill orders 
throughout  turns fill orders in any given quarter ranged from to of our total revenues 
because of the long cycle time to build our products  our lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
the high turns fill requirement together with the uncertainty of product mix and pricing  make it difficult to predict future levels of sales and profitability and may require us to carry higher levels of inventory 
gross margin 
gross margin represents net revenues less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues primarily includes the cost of purchasing semiconductor devices from our independent foundries  packaging  assembly and test services from our independent foundries and assembly and test contractors and our operating costs associated with the procurement  storage and shipment of products 
gross margin for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  to million from million for as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased to for from for the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a change in our product and customer mix as well as the effect of selling previously written down inventory of million in gross margin for the year ended december  increased by  or million  to million for from million for the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the shipments of usb products acquired as part of the netchip technology  inc acquisition beginning in may as well as higher unit shipments of pci products 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales to for from for was primarily due to shipments of lower margin products acquired as part of the netchip technology  inc acquisition 
included in gross margin for and is the effect of selling previously written down inventory of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to an expected change in our product and customer mix associated with the acquisition of netchip technology  inc future gross margin is highly dependent on the product and customer mix of net revenues 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design  and development activities 
in addition  expenses for outside engineering consultants  non recurring engineering at our independent foundries  and deferred stock compensation are included in r d expenses 
r d as a percent of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in included in r d is deferred stock compensation of million for each of the years ended december  and the increase in r d in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation and benefit expenses as a result of having a full year s worth of compensation related to the netchip acquisition as well as overall higher headcount and an increase in external engineering tools expense of approximately million associated with the development of new products and enhancement of existing products 
r d as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in the percentage decrease is due primarily to an increase in net revenues 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in included in r d is deferred stock compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in r d was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation and benefit expenses as a result of higher headcount associated primarily with the netchip technology  inc acquisition  and an increase in engineering tools expense of approximately million associated with the development of new products and enhancement of existing products 
we believe continued spending on research and development to develop new products is critical to our success and  consequently  expect to increase research and development expenses in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in selling and administrative activities  professional fees  trade show and other promotional expenses  as well as sales commissions to manufacturers representatives 
sg a as a percent of net revenues increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  in absolute dollars  sg a expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in sg a in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher compensation and benefit expenses of approximately million resulting mainly from higher compensation as a result of having a full year s worth of netchip related compensation expenses 
this was partially offset by lower consulting and professional fees of million due in part to the lower cost associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance effort compared to our effort in sg a as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the percentage decrease is due primarily to an increase in net revenues 
in absolute dollars  sg a expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher compensation and benefit expenses of approximately million resulting mainly from higher headcount in connection with acquisitions  higher consulting and professional fees of million due in part to our sarbanes oxley compliance effort  and an increase of approximately million in sales commissions to manufacturer s representatives as a result of higher revenues 
we expect sg a expenses in absolute dollars to likely increase in future periods 
amortization and write down of purchased intangible assets 
amortization and write down of purchased intangible assets increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is due primarily to having a full year s worth of amortization expense from developed core technology and customer base acquired as a result of the netchip technology  inc acquisition in may see note to the consolidated financial statements and a million write down of a tradename that was acquired as part of the sebring systems acquisition in a portion of the total amortization expense was attributable to amortization of developed core technology which was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is due primarily to additional amortization expense from developed core technology and customer base acquired as a result of the netchip technology  inc acquisition in may and the hint corporation acquisition in may deferred stock compensation 
we did not record deferred stock compensation in we recorded deferred stock compensation of million related to unvested stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of netchip technology  inc in may we recorded deferred stock compensation of million related to unvested stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of hint corporation in may unamortized deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably to the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period of the applicable stock grants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation expense recorded in   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase from to is due primarily to us having a full year s worth of amortization expense from deferred stock compensation expense acquired as a result of the netchip technology  inc acquisition in may the million decrease in deferred stock compensation expense from to is primarily the result of certain stock options becoming fully vested 
substantially all of these amounts are included in research and development expenses 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment balances 
interest income increased to million in from million for this increase was primarily due to higher cash and investment balances as well as higher interest rates 
interest income remained flat at million for as compared to other income  net 
other income  net  remained relatively flat at  for and provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the period ended december  was million on a pretax loss of million  compared to income tax expense of million on a pretax loss of million and income tax expense of  on a pretax loss of million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset partially offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to the write off of in process research and development and the impact of purchase accounting 
this was partially offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible amortization of deferred compensation and the write off of in process research and development 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the following a net loss of million adjusted for non cash expenses of million  which includes million in amortization of intangible assets  increases in accounts payable  other accrued expenses and deferred revenues of million  million and million  respectively  a decrease in other current assets of million and cash received from the exercise of stock options of million 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due primarily to higher product shipments in december as compared to december  increases in inventories and other assets of million and million  respectively  and capital expenditures of million 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
at the discretion of the management  we can repurchase the shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
approximately  shares had been repurchased for approximately million in cash in we did not repurchase any shares during or we believe that our existing resources  together with cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the inventory levels we maintain  the level of investment we make in new technologies and improvements to existing technologies and the levels of monthly expenses required to launch new products 
from time to time  we may also evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our technologies and market strategies 
to the extent that existing resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available or  if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us and our stockholders 
as of december   we had the following significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due in total less than year years operating leases facilities and equipment software licenses inventory purchase commitments total cash obligations see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized upon shipment and transfer of risk of loss  generally shipping point  if we believe collection is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the customer s creditworthiness 
at the end of each reporting period  the sufficiency of allowances is assessed based on the age of the receivable and the individual customer s creditworthiness 
we also sell products to distributors under agreements which may or may not include price protection and stock rotation programs 
revenue from sales of our products to all distributors is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end customer 
when we sell our products to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and its related cost and reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred revenues 
net revenues from the sales of our software developments tools is generally recognized upon shipment and is insignificant for all years presented 
we currently defer revenue on sales to distributors until the distributor has resold the product to its customer 
we are performing an evaluation of whether to recognize such revenue at the time of shipment to a distributor 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  sets forth conditions that must be met to recognize revenue at the time of sale 
among those conditions is that a company that provides a right of return to a buyer be able to reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
in the past  we have concluded that we did not meet this condition  so we have deferred revenue on sales to distributors in the manner described above 
we believe our ability to estimate returns and pricing concessions has improved 
at december   we are carrying approximately million in deferred revenues on the balance sheet  which represents the net deferred margin on approximately million on shipments to all distributors 
we anticipate that we will complete this evaluation in the first quarter of and that we are likely to conclude that it is appropriate to recognize revenue on sales to most or all of the distributors at the time we ship products to them 
as a result of this expected change  we would expect a material one time increase in our revenues and operating income for the first quarter of inventory valuation 
we evaluate the need for potential write downs of inventory by considering a combination of factors 
based on the life of the product  sales history  obsolescence  and sales forecast  we may record write downs to our inventory ranging from to 
any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased write downs  resulting in decreased gross margin 
in addition  future sales of any of our previously written down inventory may result in increased gross margin in the period of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on length of time the receivables are past due  generally thirty days 
we record reserves for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
once we have exhausted collection efforts  we will reduce the related accounts receivable against the allowance established for that receivable 
we have certain customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customer s creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
historically  our write offs have been insignificant 
goodwill 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price related to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less assumed liabilities 
we have one operating segment and business reporting unit  the sales of semiconductor devices  and we perform goodwill impairment tests annually on november and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as of december   we carried a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset of million as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
future taxable income and or tax planning strategies may eliminate all or a portion of the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine we are able to realize our deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may significantly increase income in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas inventory costs 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position  consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after june  on april  the us securities and exchange commission the sec announced a deferral of the effective date of sfas r for calendar year companies until the beginning of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition beginning in the first fiscal quarter of see stock based compensation note of the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts  for the years ended december    and as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income loss per share 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the earliest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and restatement with respect to the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the first fiscal quarter of item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents and investments of approximately million at december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
the company invests primarily in high quality  short term and long term debt instruments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
at december  and  we had unrealized losses on our investments of approximately  and million  respectively
