see also item a  risk factors factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock numerous factors may cause our total revenues and net income to fluctuate 
table of contents significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
competition the device software optimization industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
wind river s primary competition comes from the internal research and development departments of companies that develop device systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop device systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems 
historically  the advantages of shifting to a cots solution have not been fully recognized  with the decision to shift typically made at the project level 
today  the increasing software complexity associated with devices is forcing a strategic shift  as companies look to optimize their own device software development and bring devices to market faster and at lower cost 
a number of in house development projects have begun to use commercial device software based on open source standards  such as the linux operating system  as the first strategic step toward standardization 
in the linux market  wind river competes with linux distributors such as montavista software  inc  lynuxworks  inc  timesys corporation  and others  as well as indirectly with some enterprise linux vendors such as novell  inc and red hat  inc  which  to a certain extent  also offer device software solutions 
as we continue to see increased adoption of linux in markets such as telecommunications  data communications  and mobile communications  we believe there will be more standardization of the development cycle based on open source technologies  an initiative that is being driven by the osdl corporation to define a common industry specification and standardization for carrier grade linux 
this offers equipment manufacturers high availability of open system architecture for core and edge applications 
however  our competitive position could be affected if other embedded software solution vendors move to the middle ground and find new ways to be more open 
this  as well as availability of source code  the ability to create and maintain intellectual property ownership  and the ability to compete on price with reduced upfront and production licensing options could level the playing field with linux 
we also compete with independent software vendors  including microsoft corporation  mentor graphics corporation  enea ose systems ab  lynuxworks  inc  green hills software  inc  and qnx software systems  ltd 
recently acquired by harman international  as well as a number of other vendors that address one or more segments of the device system design process 
some of the companies that develop device systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales  and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
we also believe that critical competitive factors in the industry are based on the way customers and potential customers manage their process of software development 
key drivers in device software development include managing limited internal resources  controlling costs  minimizing development time  and limiting risks 
therefore  reliability  performance  price  product availability  architecture support  and customer support may also represent competitive forces affecting our industry 
we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
product development and engineering we believe that our success will continue to depend primarily on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an ever expanding range of customer and market requirements 
as of january   our product development and engineering group included full time employees 
during fiscal   and  product development and engineering expenses were million  million  and million  respectively  excluding capitalized software development costs 
for fiscal 
table of contents and  we did not have any capitalized software development costs related to development of software to be sold 
during fiscal  we incurred product and development and engineering expenses in relation to software development projects related to development of software to be sold that qualified for capitalization of million 
in addition to our strategic relationships with semiconductor companies noted in strategic alliances above  we have entered into joint engineering programs with other key customers 
our gross research and development expenses in fiscal years  and were offset by million  million  and million  respectively  in funding from these programs 
proprietary rights our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws 
as a part of our regular business processes  we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants  distributors  customers  and corporate partners  as appropriate  and thereby limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
furthermore  our licensing agreements provide for protection of our intellectual property both in terms of source code handling and underlying intellectual property ownership of modifications to the wind river code 
as we progress with our open source strategy  we may increasingly rely on third party open source products that have been developed and made available for licensing under open source license terms 
certain open source licenses  such as the gnu general public license that applies to linux and many other popular open source products  generally permit anyone to copy  modify  and distribute the software  subject only to the restriction that any resulting or derivative work that is made available to the public be licensed under those same terms instead of under our standard license terms 
therefore  as we incorporate our open source strategy into our product development  although we will retain the copyrights to the code that we develop ourselves  our most valuable intellectual property with respect to derivative works from these licenses may be our collection of trademarks 
wind river is a registered trademark in the united states and other countries worldwide 
we have used  registered  and or applied to register specific trademarks and service marks to distinguish many of our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the us and in foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark  and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
as of january   we held issued patents in the united states  none of which have expired 
the expiration dates of these patents range from to while we believe that patent protection of our products is important  any patents obtained may not provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to us 
it is also possible that their validity will be challenged 
manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist of assembling  packaging  and shipping the software products and documentation needed to fulfill each order 
outside vendors provide tape and cd duplication  printing of documentation  and manufacturing of packaging materials 
we also manufacture and assemble our hardware development tools at our facility in canton  massachusetts  and at certain subcontractor facilities 
employees as of january   we had  employees  including in sales and marketing  in professional services and support activities  in product development and engineering  and in management  operations  finance  and administration 
of these employees  were located in north america and were located outside of north america 
none of our employees in north america is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage 

table of contents our employees are vital to our success  and our key management  engineering  sales and other employees are difficult to replace 
we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees or maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
if we are unable to attract  assimilate  retain or motivate highly qualified technical and sales employees in the future through competitive compensation and employment policies  our ability to develop and introduce competitive new products in a timely manner may suffer

item a 
risk factors factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations or have a negative impact on our stock price 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our enterprise license model has impacted the timing of our reported revenues 
the adoption of a subscription based license model has impacted the timing of our reported revenues 
under the enterprise license model revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  our traditional perpetual license requires a majority of license revenues to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of the maintenance being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for a subscription based license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license 
as a result  our reported revenues have been affected by the adoption of the enterprise license model for our subscription based products 
the impact on near term and deferred revenues will continue to depend on the rate at which customers 
table of contents license products under our perpetual model or our enterprise license model 
in addition  an increase in the number of subscription license renewals on multi year terms may result in larger deferred revenues 
to the extent that the adoption rate is higher than we expect  we may experience a greater decline in near term revenues  as well as an increase in deferred revenues 
if we do not successfully manage the shift in our revenues to our enterprise license model  we may not be able to manage our expenses  many of which are fixed in nature  which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
we may not continue to increase adoption of our enterprise license model 
today  the majority of our products are licensed under an enterprise license model that is based upon subscription licenses rather than our traditional perpetual licenses 
there is a risk that we will not be able to continue or increase our rate of adoption to our subscription based model  that customers may not accept the new products we offer under our enterprise license model or that they may reject the terms of the model itself 
in addition  although enterprise licenses represent a potential source of renewable license revenue  there is also a risk that new and transitioned customers will not renew their licenses at the end of the term 
there is a further risk that the more complex and time consuming negotiations for enterprise licenses may affect our ability to close such transactions  and that customers who purchase enterprise licenses may spend less in the aggregate over the term of the enterprise license than if they had been required to purchase perpetual licenses 
because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be derived from production licenses  we are dependent upon the ability of our customers to develop and penetrate new markets successfully 
our production license revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate production license agreements with our customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in particular  we derive significant revenues from customers that develop products in highly competitive and technologically complex markets such as the internet infrastructure  server and storage  digital consumer  aerospace and defense  industrial control and automotive markets 
if these customers sell fewer products or otherwise face significant economic difficulties  our revenues will decline 
we cannot control our customers product development or commercialization or predict their success 
in addition  we depend on our customers to accurately report the use of their products in order for us to collect our revenues from production licenses 
if our customers are not successful with their products or do not accurately report use of their products to us  our production license revenues may decline significantly 
we have adopted an open source strategy and have released products based on open source that may not be successfully adopted or may not generate profits 
we offer products that are based on open source software  including our stand alone development tool products for use with open source components  and our platform products that are distributed with open source components 
we cannot be certain whether these and future open source product offerings will be successfully adopted by new and current customers and our open source strategy may create additional risks for us 
specifically  we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop the products necessary to satisfy customer demand  or that our customers will adopt our products based on open source 
additionally  even if our products are adopted by our customers  they may not be profitable 
very few open source companies have been profitable and we may not be able to generate profits on our linux based offerings 
moreover  it is possible that these efforts to coexist with the open source movement could result in a decline in sales of our proprietary software either as a result of a diversion of internal resources or customer preference 
additionally  customers may defer orders in anticipation of our new products 
if any of these events were to occur  our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected 

table of contents our open source products may subject us to increased legal risks 
as our products that include open source components are adopted  we face increased legal risks  which could affect our ability to develop or sell our open source products 
our open source strategy may make us increasingly vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights  in particular because many of the open source components we may incorporate with our products are developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
in addition  third parties could allege that our own development efforts considered to be proprietary have resulted in allegedly infringing work or work that is subject to open source obligations 
our risk is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications 
defending claims of infringement  even claims without significant merit  can be expensive 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
it is also possible that our own intellectual property rights in derivative works we develop under the gnu general public license gpl that applies to linux and many other popular open source products  or other open source licenses  may be infringed and that as a result we may need to bring our own claim against third parties 
in addition  the enforceability of the gpl and other open source licenses affect the success of our open source strategy 
the gpl states that any program licensed under it may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
the gpl is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
it is possible that this court would hold the gnu license to be unenforceable in that litigation  that the gnu license or other open source license could be found to be unenforceable in a separate legal challenge  or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
if an open source license that applies to the licensing of components of our open source products is found to be partially or completely unenforceable  or if there are claims of infringement  we could be required to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  reengineer our products  or discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis 
an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business 
uncertainty regarding the legal risks related to open source components could affect sales of our open source products generally 
finally  as result of legal concerns about open source  we are facing increased pressure from our customers to adopt additional indemnification or otherwise protect them from potential threats by third parties related to open source 
we have  in limited circumstances  provided additional indemnification related to open source 
our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we have to indemnify our customers from the threats posed by open source 
if we do not continue to address new and rapidly changing markets and increasingly complex technologies successfully and deliver our products on a timely basis  our revenues and operating results will decline 
the device software optimization market is characterized by ongoing technological developments  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements and product offerings in the device market 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt and respond to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to continually update our existing products to keep them current with customer needs or to develop new or enhanced products to take advantage of new technologies  emerging standards and expanding customer requirements  our existing products could become obsolete and our financial performance would suffer 
we have from time to time experienced delays in the commercial release of new technologies  new products and enhancements of existing products 
these delays are commonplace in the software industry due to the complexity and unpredictability of the development work required 
if we fail to commercially release new products on a regular basis  our financial performance could suffer 
we must effectively market and sell new product offerings to key customers  because once a customer has designed a product with a particular operating system  that customer typically is reluctant to change its supplier due to the significant related costs 
if we cannot adapt or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to new technologies and new customer requirements  or if the new products we develop are not attractive to our customers  sales of our products could decline 

table of contents numerous factors may cause our total revenues and net income to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our total revenues and net income 
these fluctuations make financial planning and forecasting more difficult 
in addition  these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash  which could negatively impact our operations 
as discussed more fully below  these fluctuations also could increase the volatility of our stock price 
factors that may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and net income include acceptance by our customers of our current and new product offerings  the number and timing of orders we receive  including disproportionately higher receipt and shipment of orders in the last month of the quarter  changes in the length of our products sales cycles  which increase as our customers purchase decisions become more strategic and are made at higher management levels  reductions in the number of engineering projects started by our customers due to their own difficult financial or economic conditions  the impact of impairment charges arising from past acquisitions  the success of our customers products from which we derive our production license revenues  the mix of our revenues as between sales of products that have more upfront revenue  subscriptions that have more deferred revenues and services which have lower profit margins  our ability to control our operating expenses  and fully realize the impact of the restructuring plans we have implemented  our ability to continue to develop  introduce and ship competitive new products and product enhancements quickly  possible deferrals of orders by customers in anticipation of new product introductions  announcements  product introductions and price reductions by our competitors  our ability to manage costs for fixed price consulting agreements  seasonal product purchases by our customers  which historically have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter  the impact of  and our ability to react to  natural disasters and or events of terrorism  the impact of  and our ability to react to business disruptions arising from or relating to internet or computer viruses service interruptions  changes in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products and services  economic  political and other conditions in the united states and internationally  foreign currency exchange rates  the impact of changes to existing accounting pronouncements relating to income taxes  and the impact of any stock based compensation charges arising from the issuance of stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights or any other stock based awards 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high or may cause our net revenues and net income to fluctuate significantly 
results from prior periods are thus not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods 

table of contents we face intense competition in the device software optimization industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices 
the device software optimization industry is characterized by rapid change  new and complex technology and intense competition 
our ability to maintain our current market share depends upon our ability to satisfy customer requirements  enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products 
due to the complexity of the markets in which we operate  where our customers often develop device systems in house  it is difficult to assess the impact of competition on our business and our related share of the markets that we operate in 
we have faced increasing competition in recent years as customers have decreased research and development budgets  sought to increase the value they receive from vendors  including us  attempted to leverage a more competitive bidding process when spending research and development budgets and or deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part 
as a result  we believe that some customers have elected not to purchase our products and have chosen to undertake such development in house  selected solutions they perceive to be less expensive or relied upon existing licenses from us rather than making new purchases 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
increased competitiveness may result in reductions in the prices of our products  run time royalties and services  lower than expected gross margins or loss of market share  any of which would harm our business 
our primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop device systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop device systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems  making acceptance of our products as a replacement more difficult 
additionally  many of these in house departments may increasingly choose to use open source software  such as the linux operating system 
we also compete with independent software vendors and  to a limited extent  with open source vendors 
some of the companies that develop device systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
demands for rapid change and the increasing complexity of the technology in our industry intensify the competition we face 
in addition  our competitors may consolidate or establish strategic alliances to expand product offerings and resources or address new market segments 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
these factors favor larger competitors that have the resources to develop new technologies or to respond more quickly with new product offerings or product enhancements 
we may be unable to meet the pace of rapid development set by our competitors or may incur additional costs attempting to do so  which may cause declines in our operating results 
our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete  any of which could adversely affect our competitive position and therefore our operating results 
patent  trademark or copyright infringement  trade secret misappropriation or product liability claims against us may result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to expend significant resources 
in addition  patent or copyright claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent  trademark or copyright infringement  trade secret misappropriation or other intellectual property claims  and there is always the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us or against our customers under circumstances that might require us to provide indemnification 
adoption of our open source strategy increases this risk in part because many of the open source components we may incorporate with our products are developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control 
additionally  because our products are increasingly used in applications  such as network infrastructure  transportation  medical and mission critical business systems  in which the failure of the device system could cause property damage  personal injury or economic loss  we may face product liability claims 

table of contents although our agreements with our customers contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to infringement and liability claims and typically do not provide for indemnification for open source materials  our agreements may not be effective in limiting our exposure in all circumstances 
any of these types of claims  with or without merit  could result in claims for indemnification by us or costly litigation  could require us to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or remedy product defects  cause product shipment delays or require us to pay significant damages if the claims are successful 
in the case of infringement of another party s intellectual property  we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  however  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses will be available or that they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not successful in defending these claims or  with respect to infringement claims  were to fail to obtain royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete 
our success depends significantly upon the proprietary technology contained in our products 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our technology and products 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology  or that we can maintain our technology as trade secrets 
in addition  discovery and investigation of unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
we expect software piracy  which is difficult to detect  to be a persistent problem  particularly in those foreign countries where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property 
we might not have adequate remedies for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights by third parties  employees or consultants 
further  we have in the past initiated  and in the future may initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor  such actions could result in significant expenses to us  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks or cause product shipment delays 
our significant international business activities subject us to increased costs and economic risks 
we develop and sell a substantial percentage of our products internationally 
for fiscal  revenues from international sales were million  or of total revenues  as compared to million  or  of total revenue for fiscal additionally  we have investments in  or have made acquisitions of  companies located outside the united states 
over the long term  we expect to continue to make investments to further support and expand our international operations and increase our direct sales force and distribution network in emea  japan and asia pacific 
risks inherent in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls and regulatory requirements  the costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  differences in business cultures and sales cycles  differences in operation and sales support expenses  unexpected changes in tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiaries and branch operations  the costs and risks of operating in countries experiencing geopolitical conflict and or terrorism  the effect of our adoption of global pricing models  difficulties in integrating products and operations from foreign acquisitions  the impact of local health and political crises that prohibit or severely limit travel or other interaction with a local economic market  exposure to local economic slowdowns  and the need to guarantee credit instruments extended to support foreign operations 
any of these events  regionally and as a whole  could reduce our international sales and increase our costs of doing business internationally and have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and net operating results 
if our strategic relationships are not successful  our product offerings  distribution and or revenues may be adversely impacted 
we have many strategic relationships with semiconductor companies and customers 
these strategic relationships are complex because some of the companies that are our strategic partners in certain business areas are also our competitors in other business areas 
our strategic partners may also have concurrent relationships with companies that provide open source and in house solutions  which may put pressure on our product development roadmaps  timelines and prices 
if we are not successful in developing and maintaining these strategic relationships  our business may be harmed 
if our collaborative marketing and distribution agreements terminate or expire  the scope of our product offerings may be restricted  and the distribution of our products and revenues may be adversely impacted 
the costs of software development can be high  and we may not realize revenues from our development efforts for a substantial period of time 
introducing new products that rapidly address changing market demands requires a continued high level of investment in research and development 
our product development and engineering expenses  which are net of funded research and development and capitalized research and development  were million  or of total revenues  for fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  for fiscal if we are required to undertake extensive capital outlays to address changes in the device software optimization market  we may be unable to realize revenue as soon as we may expect 
the costs associated with software development are increasing  including the costs of acquiring or licensing new technologies 
our investment in new and existing market opportunities prior to our ability to generate revenue from these new opportunities may adversely affect our operating results 
changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse revenue fluctuations and affect our results of operations or how we conduct our business 
on february   we adopted fasb statement r  share based payment  sfas r and are now required to measure and record compensation costs for all stock based compensation  including our stock options and employee stock purchase plan  at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material adverse impact on our gross margin  income from operations  net income  and our net income per share by decreasing our income or creating a loss by the additional amount of such stock compensation charges 
also  a change in any other accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
other new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

table of contents our common stock price is subject to volatility 
in recent years  the stock markets in general and the shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these recent price fluctuations are not necessarily proportionate to the operating performance of the companies affected 
our stock price has similarly experienced significant volatility 
as reported on the nasdaq national market  during fiscal  our stock had an intra day high sales price of and an intra day low sales price of and  during fiscal  our stock had an intra day high sales price of and an intra day low sales price of 
in some of our past fiscal quarters  we experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
these factors relating to the fluctuations in our revenues and net income may continue to affect our stock price 
comments by  or changes in estimates from  securities analysts as well as significant developments involving our competitors or our industry could also affect our stock price 
in addition  the market price of our common stock is affected by the stock performance of other technology companies generally  as well as companies in our industry and our customers in particular 
other broad market and industry factors may negatively affect our operating results or cause our stock price to decline  as may general political or economic conditions in the united states and globally  such as recessions  or interest rate or currency fluctuations 
in particular  the stock market may be adversely impacted  or experience unusual volatility  as a result of the outbreak of armed conflict or hostilities involving the united states or incidences of terrorism in  or directed at  the united states or its allies 
because certain of our customers provide products and services to us government agencies  as their supplier we may be subject to unique risks that could increase our costs and make revenue related to these customers more difficult to predict 
as a subcontractor to the us government  we must comply with and are affected by certain laws and regulations related to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts and other regulations particularly related to the aerospace and defense industry  such as export control regulations including international trafficking in arms regulations 
in addition  under applicable regulations  various audit agencies of the us government conduct regular audits of contractors compliance with a variety of us government regulations and have the right to review retroactively the financial records under most us government contracts 
further  as a us government subcontractor  we are subject to an increased risk of investigation  criminal prosecution  civil fraud  whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not 
this increases our internal procedures and costs  and as well we may face an increased risk of non compliance as these processes and rules requirements involve separate processes that are outside our standard  commercial practices 
in addition  our contracts with customers providing products and services to the us government are subject to uncertainty since their governmental contracts are subject to us government appropriations that are changeable and determined on an annual basis 
also  the us government has the right to modify  curtail or terminate customer contracts  which would result in corresponding changes to our contracts with our customers 
some of our contracts are subject to contract accounting  which requires judgment relative to assessing risk  estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding scheduling and technical issues 
because of these risks  it is difficult to predict anticipated future revenues attributable to government related subcontracts 
if we do not effectively manage these risks  our operating results could be materially negatively impacted 
our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives 
in each of fiscal through  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our cost structure more closely with our anticipated revenues 
our restructuring plans were based on certain 
table of contents assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of the current industry adjustment and general economic trends 
we cannot be certain that the assumptions underlying the restructuring plans will prove to be accurate 
if they are not  our restructuring plans may not result in the correct alignment of our anticipated revenues and cost structure 
our restructuring plans involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures  that may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of  employee positions since the beginning of fiscal we also recorded net restructuring charges of million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and  respectively 
these measures may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
in addition  the costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may exceed our estimated costs of these actions 
additional restructuring actions may result in further cash and or non cash charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will continue to be profitable as a result of our restructuring plans 
we have substantial financial commitments  which could make it difficult for us to obtain financing and deplete our cash reserves 
additionally  these commitments could be accelerated in certain circumstances  which could impact the timing of the impact on our cash flows 
as of january   we had million in outstanding indebtedness under our convertible subordinated notes 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
the indenture under which our convertible subordinated notes were issued contains customary events of default  and also provides that an event of default occurs if we or one of our significant subsidiaries fail to pay  at final maturity or upon acceleration  any indebtedness for money borrowed in an outstanding principal amount in excess of million  and the indebtedness is not discharged  or the default is not cured  waived or rescinded within days after written notice is provided in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
under the terms of our convertible subordinated notes  if an event of default were to occur for any of the aforementioned reasons or other reasons and we do not or cannot cure the event of default within specified periods  the lenders could in each case accelerate payment of the indebtedness 
in june and march  we repurchased million and million of our convertible subordinated debt  respectively 
the costs associated with acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that  as part of our business strategy  we will continue to evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities in businesses  products and technologies that complement ours 
these investments and acquisitions can be expensive and often require us to dedicate significant time and resources to the process 
we have incurred significant costs in connection with acquisition transactions in prior fiscal years and may incur significant costs in connection with future transactions  whether or not they are consummated 
acquisitions involve additional risks including  among others  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  and potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development 
if we cannot successfully manage the integration of businesses we may acquire or are unable to realize the benefits of  or anticipated revenues from  our acquisitions  our business  financial condition and operating results could suffer 
if revenues associated with acquired businesses do not meet our original expectations  acquisitions may result in charges relating to impairment of acquired goodwill and purchased intangibles

our software and development tools are used to optimize the functionality of devices as diverse as digital imaging products  automobile braking systems  internet routers  avionics control panels and factory automation equipment 
wind river offers customers device software optimization solutions to enhance product performance  standardize designs across projects and throughout the enterprise  reduce research and development costs and shorten product development cycles 
key operating and financial metrics members of our senior management team regularly review key operating and financial metrics such as net revenues  earnings per share  operating cash flows and net change in short term deferred revenues 
these metrics allow management to monitor the robustness and profitability of our business and to evaluate any necessary areas for investment or  in contrast  for improved efficiencies and effectiveness 
how we earn our revenues we earn our revenues from the license and sale of our products and from providing services related to our products 
our software products are licensed to our customers for their development use under either a subscription license or a perpetual license 
customers who purchase a subscription license  also referred to as an enterprise license  are charged per term  typically  an annual fee  renewable at the election of the customer 
customers who purchase a perpetual license are generally charged a one time  up front fee 
once development is completed  whether under a subscription license or a perpetual license  we also generally charge our customers a production license fee for every copy of our product included in the final  manufactured device 
customers either report their usage on a quarterly basis or purchase a block of production licenses in advance of use 
we also earn revenue for support and maintenance services for our products  which includes telephone support and provision of updates 
for products licensed under a perpetual license  support and maintenance may be purchased for a separate fee 
for products licensed under a subscription license  support and maintenance is included in the per term fee  and includes upgrades 
in addition  we also charge customers for other services related to our products  such as training and professional services 
our training services are generally purchased for a fixed fee  while our professional services are available on both a time and materials and fixed price contract basis 
our professional services are designed to assist our customers with the design and development of a completed device or application 
our product revenues are comprised of revenues from perpetual licenses  the revenues that we receive for all production licenses  whether related to development under a perpetual license or a subscription license  and hardware revenues 
our subscription revenues are derived from revenues from our subscription licenses  not related to production fees  and includes support and maintenance provided to these customers 
our services revenues are derived from our professional services revenues and training  as well as revenues for support and maintenance of our products under perpetual licenses

table of contents our licensing models we license our software using two primary licensing models  subscription based enterprise licensing and project based perpetual licensing 
our wind river platforms and workbench integrated development suite are primarily licensed under enterprise licensing 
our subscription based enterprise license model has been offered to customers since november this model includes subscription based development licenses that are typically one year in duration  although some licenses extend to periods greater than one year 
subscription based enterprise licenses eliminate the more traditional project and site restrictions on the use of our products 
at the end of the subscription period  the customer s right to develop using wind river platforms or tools expires unless renewed 
most subscription based enterprise licenses i have an initial duration of one year  with annual renewals  ii include payment terms for the full cost of the annual subscription within days after entering into the enterprise license agreement  iii include production license reporting once a customer makes a commercial release of a device that incorporates our products  and iv may include a number of service credits for field engineering support 
during fiscal and  some customers have entered into multi year license agreements with us 
these agreements have generally included payment terms for the full cost of the multi year subscription within days after entering into the enterprise licensing agreement 
we also offer to customers a variation on this model that includes a higher priced per seat subscription without a separate per unit production license fees  allowing our customers to choose between the shared success model that includes production license fees or a pure per seat subscription model without a separate production license fee 
to date  the majority of subscription licenses continue to include per unit production licenses fees  which aggregate volumes across the enterprise to create incentives for broader adoption 
however  we believe that offering certain variations of our enterprise licensing models allows our customers to have greater flexibility in meeting their business needs 
we also license our software under project based perpetual licenses 
under this model  our customers pay an up front  development license fee together with an annual maintenance fee that is based on a fixed percentage of the total licensing fees 
for device software products  the customer typically also pays an additional per unit  per project production license fee based on the number of copies of our operating system software that are included in final manufactured devices 
the terms of the perpetual license for our software restrict the customer s use to a specific project  such as a line of printers or digital camera and  as a result  any software licenses or prepaid production license fees can generally only be used on that specific project 
under our perpetual license model  we sell our products at the specific project level and are dealing primarily with the engineers leading and making decisions for individual projects 
the strategy for our wind river platform products is to seek enterprise wide adoption 
as a result  the customer s decision to adopt our products is more strategic  leading to longer sales lead times and ultimately more complex and time consuming negotiations 
our success is therefore dependent upon our ability to first educate our current and potential customers of the value associated with our wind river platform products and services and  secondly  our ability to negotiate and close such transactions with these customers on terms which are mutually agreeable 
due to the fact that a significant portion of our business is sold under the subscription based enterprise licensing model  our reported revenue in a given quarter does not necessarily reflect our level of business activity 
under the subscription based enterprise license model  revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  under applicable accounting rules  for a perpetual license the majority of license revenue is required to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of maintenance to be deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for an enterprise license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license  but will result in increased deferred revenue compared to the perpetual license 
we expect customers to continue to transition from perpetual licensing to enterprise licensing in the current year and this may impact the timing of our reported revenues 
the mix of enterprise licensing 
table of contents orders and perpetual orders in any given quarter can vary and may consequently also have an impact on that quarter s reported revenues 
recent operating results during fiscal  we continued to grow revenue and deferred revenue while improving our profitability and cash flow from operations 
growth in revenue and deferred revenue was primarily driven by an increase in our subscription based enterprise licensing business arising from additional focus on our device software optimization strategy and an improvement in the overall economy 
our total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or and increased by million or in fiscal over revenues of million in fiscal our net income was million or per fully diluted share in fiscal our net income in fiscal was million or per fully diluted share and our net loss in fiscal was million  or a net loss of per fully diluted share 
our total deferred revenue has increased by to million at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of continued increases in sales of our subscription based enterprise license products 
short term deferred revenues have increased by to million at january  from million at january  of the total deferred revenue balance at january   million relates to deferred revenue classified as long term 
this deferred revenue relates to the portion of multi year contracts that is due to be recognized as revenue in a time period greater than one year from the balance sheet date 
we generated cash flow from operations of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and cash used in operations of million in fiscal we repurchased million of our convertible subordinated notes in fiscal we also repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million during fiscal  and we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate market price of million in march acquisitions on january   we acquired the assets and certain obligations of the scopetools business unit of real time innovations  inc rti 
total consideration for the transaction was million  comprising million in cash   shares of our common stock with a fair value of   in acquisition costs and  in assumed maintenance support costs 
we determined that  of the amount paid to rti as part of the purchase consideration related to royalty payments due rti under a pre existing distributor arrangement whereby we licensed the software of the scopetools business 
this amount was calculated in accordance with the terms of pre existing arrangement and has been recognized as cost of revenue and deducted from the purchase consideration 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
 we allocated the total consideration to the intangible assets and tangible liabilities acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to intangible assets and million was allocated to goodwill 
the intangible assets consist of existing technology of million  core technology of  maintenance agreements of  and non competition agreements of  and are being amortized over periods of two to seven years 
the goodwill of million represents our assigned value for the long term potential of the integration of the scopetools business unit into our overall product strategy 
the scopetools business unit s results of operations have been included in our results since the date of acquisition 
on march   we acquired interpeak ab interpeak for approximately million  primarily for cash consideration  plus our acquisition costs 
interpeak is a privately held swedish company that provides 
table of contents networking  security  and mobility middleware software that enables next generation devices to connect securely to the internet 
we expect to account for this acquisition as a purchase transaction in accordance with sfas no 
and  accordingly  the total consideration will be allocated to the intangible assets and tangible assets and liabilities acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by us on a regular basis and which are also reviewed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
an accounting policy is deemed by us to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity are revenue recognition  estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation revenue recognition we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  subscription revenues and service revenues  in each case  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model and from sales of our hardware 
subscription revenues consist primarily of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model  including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and support services such as installation and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
agreements generally do not allow the right of return or sales price adjustments 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists 
table of contents for all undelivered elements of the arrangement  and collection is determined to be probable 
these four criteria are further defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice for arrangements other than a clickwrap agreement to have non cancelable contracts and generally a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues on an arrangement 
for products purchased under a clickwrap agreement it is generally our customary practice to have a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues 
delivery has occurred 
product revenues for software and hardware are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master  with standard transfer terms of fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
if only non essential products or services are undelivered and if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the recognition of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenues from time based and subscription based licenses ratably over the term of the agreement 
our enterprise license model agreements require that we deliver unspecified future updates and upgrades within the same product family during the subscription term 
accordingly  fees from our enterprise license agreements are recognized ratably over their term 
if an agreement includes a specified upgrade  all revenue that would have otherwise been recognized is deferred until the specified upgrade is delivered 
sales to original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers are recognized at the time delivery has occurred for perpetual licenses and ratably over the related term for subscription licenses 
sales to distributors are generally recognized as noted above provided that we have evidence of an end user agreement 
professional service revenues are generally separately priced  are available from a number of suppliers  and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee if the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop generally  revenue from time and materials consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed 
contract accounting is utilized for service revenues from fixed price contracts that require significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the arrangement fee is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
to date these losses have not been significant 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
service revenues from software maintenance  support and update fees are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is typically months 
service revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are provided 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment and other terms associated with the transaction 
for product and subscription revenues  if a significant portion of a fee is due after our standard payment terms  which are generally no greater than days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due subject to all other revenue recognition criteria being met 

table of contents collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we establish vsoe for maintenance services by reference to substantive stated future renewal rates included in contracts or the amounts charged on similar transactions 
we establish vsoe for professional services time and materials contracts by reference to standard hourly rates separately charged for services 
we do not have vsoe for professional services fixed price contracts 
where such services are sold in conjunction with other products  significant management judgment is required to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable  whether vsoe exists for all elements of a transaction and the related revenue recognition impact of this  whether or not collection is probable and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue could result 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances was million and million at january  and  respectively 
the provision represents and as a percentage of net revenues  for fiscal and  respectively 
similarly  management makes estimates of the non collectibility of accounts receivables  specifically analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  geographic concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to the identification of individual specific doubtful accounts receivable  we provide allowances for other accounts receivable based on our historical experience 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
the allowance represents and as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  as at january  and  respectively 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of activities during the years reported 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill and purchased intangibles 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received 
these include acquired customer base  technological know how  trademarks and goodwill 
intangible assets  other than goodwill are amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from one year to seven years on a straight line basis 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the fair value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets received 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of assets received is the income approach  under which we must make assumptions as to the future cash flows of the acquired entity 
table of contents or assets  the appropriate discount rate to use to present value the cash flows and the anticipated life of the acquired assets  and the market approach  under which we compare the value of our business unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
if we made different judgments  material differences in the amount of fair value assigned to purchased intangibles and goodwill could arise 
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we currently operate as one segment and have one reporting unit 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill for impairment purposes were the income and market approaches 
goodwill was million at january  and million at january  and purchased intangibles  net  were million and million at january  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets when circumstances indicate an impairment has occurred and in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
accordingly  we evaluate asset recoverability when an event occurs that may impair recoverability of the asset 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying amount of each asset by reviewing the following factors the undiscounted value of expected operating cash flows in relation to its net capital investments  the estimated useful or contractual life of the asset  the contract or product supporting the asset 
in the case of purchased intangibles and capitalized software development costs  we periodically review the recoverability of the asset s value by evaluating its products with respect to technological advances  competitive products and the needs of its customers 
a significant portion of our long lived assets  including goodwill  are located in north america 
the assessment for any required impairment charge for goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets is based upon estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill  purchased intangibles or long lived assets using an appropriate discount rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the associated investment 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are highly subjective and require significant management judgment as these estimates require us to make assumptions regarding future operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
for details about the impairment charge we recorded during fiscal  see results of operations years ended january   and impairment of purchased intangibles below 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
judgment is applied to estimate taxable income by jurisdiction and our ability to utilize any unexpired credits and or net operating losses 
we are subject to income tax audits in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate and  as a result  must also assess exposures to any potential issues arising from current or future audits of current and prior years tax returns 
accordingly  we must assess such potential exposure and  where necessary  provide a reserve to cover any expected loss 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
during the years ended january  and  we realized benefits of  and million  respectively  arising from the final assessment of foreign tax audits 
our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss amongst the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 

table of contents deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
and are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
with the exception of certain international jurisdictions  we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in our remaining jurisdictions will not be realized  due primarily to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits before they expire 
accordingly  we have recorded a deferred tax asset of million and  related to certain international jurisdictions and a full valuation allowance against the remainder of our deferred tax assets at january  and  respectively 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to our remaining deferred tax assets would cause a material increase to income in the period such determination is made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income amongst other items in determining whether a full or partial release of a valuation allowance was required 
in addition  our assessments sometimes require us to schedule future taxable income in accordance with sfas no 
to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment 
following our analyses  in fiscal we released our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in austria  canada  sweden  israel and released part of our valuation allowance in japan and in fiscal we released our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in germany 
the release of these valuation allowances caused an incremental tax benefit of million and  to be recognized in fiscal and  respectively 
the valuation allowance at january  is million and relates primarily to deferred tax assets held in the us 
we estimate that when this valuation allowance is released  approximately million will result in an income tax benefit to the statement of operations and approximately million related to stock option exercises and related tax credits will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
we will continue to evaluate the ability to realize  by jurisdiction  our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
due to our recent profitability  we believe that it is at least reasonably possible that a material adjustment to the valuation allowance may occur within the near term 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  currently encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have continued to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method 
under that method  compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
on february   we were required to adopt sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure and record compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value 
this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice 
application of sfas no 
r is very complex and involves a number of assumptions  including volatility and the expected term 
incorrect application of the rules or the use of incorrect assumptions could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model  and from sales of our hardware 
subscription revenues consist of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and support services such as installation and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product revenues subscription revenues service revenues total revenues  net total revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in total revenues in fiscal compared to was primarily due to increased subscription revenues earned under our enterprise licensing model 
the increase in total revenues in fiscal compared to was primarily due to higher customer demand for our software and hardware  improvements in production license revenues and increased investments in device software optimization solutions as a result of an improvement in the overall economy 
our product revenues have been affected as the result of the transition of some of our customers to our wind river platforms 
fees from the wind river platforms are recorded as subscription revenue ratably over the license term  which is typically one year 
in contrast under our perpetual model  a significant percentage of the transaction fee is recognized in the quarter the transaction is completed 
while this has impacted  and will continue to impact  our revenues as customers continue transition to the wind river platforms  our deferred revenues have increased to million at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of the transition of business to our wind river platforms 
our service revenues  in particular maintenance revenues  have also been affected by the transition due to the fact that services under the enterprise licensing model are recorded as subscription revenues  rather than under service revenues  as they are when related to maintenance on a perpetual license 
product revenues product revenues are comprised of perpetual license revenues  including hardware revenues  and production license revenues from perpetual and subscription licensing 
the table below sets forth information for such components 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages perpetual license revenues production license revenues total product revenues 
table of contents perpetual license revenues declined or million in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined or million in fiscal compared to fiscal perpetual license revenues have sequentially decreased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal  and due to the transition of our customers to our wind river platforms  which are accounted for as subscription revenues 
we expect perpetual license revenues may decline as our customers continue their transition to our enterprise licensing model 
production license revenues increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal and was primarily from the growing networking and consumer devices segments  further improvement in our execution of our revenue assurance program  which includes increased monitoring of customer license compliance and improvement in our customer s own quarterly reporting processes 
we expect production license revenues to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal subscription revenues subscription revenues increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal the significant increase in fiscal in subscription revenues resulted primarily from the continued transition of a number of our customers from our traditional perpetual licensing model to our wind river platforms under the enterprise license model  also known as our subscription model  and increasing volumes of subscription business with these customers 
we expect that subscription revenues will continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal fiscal was the first full fiscal year in which we sold our wind river platform products under the enterprise license model 
the continued transition of customers to enterprise license model will continue to affect the timing of when we recognize revenues because we recognize fees under this business model ratably as opposed to our perpetual model where a significant proportion of the fee is recognized at the time the transaction is completed 
service revenues service revenues are derived from fees for professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  customer training and consulting 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages maintenance revenues other service revenues total service revenues maintenance revenues declined or million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and declined or million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in both fiscal and is primarily due to the continued transition of our customers to our wind river platforms  which include maintenance as a part of the subscription fee and is therefore recognized as subscription revenue 
we expect maintenance revenues will continue to decline as our customers increasingly adopt our subscription licensing model and  as such  these revenues will be recognized within the subscription revenue category 
other service revenues  which consist of professional services and training  increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased demand in our digital consumer market 
during fiscal year  and  we generated million  million  and million in revenue from fixed price services contracts  respectively 
fixed price services contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
time and materials services contracts are recognized as services are performed 

table of contents revenues by geography years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages north america emea japan asia pacific total revenues  net revenues from international sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal the overall increase in fiscal was primarily due to a increase in revenues from north america and a increase in revenues from emea between fiscal and the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a increase in revenues from emea  a increase in revenues from japan  and a increase in revenues from asia pacific 
the increases in revenues in each geographic area over these periods resulted primarily from higher customer demand for our software  both domestically and internationally 
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements did not have a significant impact on international revenues during fiscal as is the case with north america  our international revenues have also been affected as the result of the transition of some of our customers to our wind river platforms  in which revenue is recognized ratably as opposed to being recognized immediately under our perpetual license model 
international revenues accounted for of total revenues in both fiscal and  and in fiscal we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues  although the actual percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
our international sales are primarily denominated in united states dollars  euro  united kingdom sterling or japanese yen 
deferred revenues our deferred revenues consist of the following as of january  dollar change percentage change in thousands  except percentages current deferred revenues subscriptions maintenance and other total current deferred revenues long term deferred revenues subscriptions maintenance and other total long term deferred revenues total deferred revenues deferred subscription revenues represent customer billings and payments made in advance for software licensed over a subscription period 
subscription periods vary from annual to multi year 
long term deferred revenues represent the portion of multi year contracts that are due to be recognized as revenue in a time period greater than one year from the balance sheet date 
maintenance and other deferred revenues include primarily deferred service revenues and maintenance revenues 
deferred service revenues include pre payments for software consulting and other product services  including software license transactions that are not segmented 
table of contents from consulting services 
revenue for these services is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred maintenance revenues represent customer billings and payments made in advance for annual support contracts 
maintenance is typically billed on a per annum basis in advance and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the growth in subscription deferred revenues results from the continued transition from our traditional perpetual licensing model to our wind river platforms enterprise license model and increasing business activity levels for this business model 
the growth in deferred revenues for maintenance and other during fiscal relates primarily to the additional deferred consulting services revenue  due to timing differences between customer billings and revenue recognition 
cost of revenues years ended january  percentage of associated revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product subscription service amortization of purchased intangibles total cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage the general increase in overall costs of products and services  excluding amortization of purchased intangibles  was primarily attributable to personnel related costs 
cost of product 
product related costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for employees involved in production  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  and shipping costs 
cost of products as a percentage of associated revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in both years was due primarily to lower allocated direct production costs and increased production license revenues that have only marginal cost of product 
the decrease in absolute dollars of cost of product in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in third party royalty costs due primarily to the acquisition of the scopetools business unit of rti in the fourth quarter of fiscal consequently eliminating certain royalty expenses following the acquisition  partially offset by increased hardware costs and manufacturing distribution costs 
product related cost of revenues may be affected in the future by costs of distribution related to the introduction of new products  royalty costs for use of third party software in our products and by the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
cost of subscription 
subscription related costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for employees  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  shipping costs and costs of providing subscription related maintenance and support services 
cost of subscriptions increased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in subscription costs in both years was primarily due to the higher allocation of maintenance and support services costs and higher production costs as a result of the related increase in subscription revenue 
subscription related production costs were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
subscription related maintenance and support services costs were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in cost of subscription revenues as a percentage of subscription revenues in fiscal compared 
table of contents to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal  were primarily related to a lower utilization of support services 
we expect costs of subscriptions to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of subscription revenue based on the level of sales of our wind river platforms and the continued transition of existing customers from our perpetual based licensing to the enterprise license model 
cost of subscriptions may be affected in the future by the direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  costs of distribution  royalty costs for use of third party software in our products  and the costs of providing subscription related maintenance and support services 
cost of services 
service related cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with providing services  including consulting services  to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization  as well as costs to recruit  develop and retain services professionals 
the increase in absolute dollars of cost of service in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in full time employees and outside consultants for our professional services as a result of the increased level of services business in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars of service costs in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced use of outside consultants and a reduction of full time employees as part of the restructuring programs implemented beginning fiscal through fiscal we expect cost of services to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of service revenue based on our ability to fully utilize our professional services organization 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles relates to amortization of completed technology acquired through purchase transactions 
the decreases in amortization in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal were due to a lower amortizable base of purchased intangible assets 
we expect that amortization of purchased intangibles will increase in fiscal due to our recent acquisition of interpeak which will be accounted for as a purchase transaction 
purchased intangibles  including completed technology  will be amortized over its estimated useful economic life 
operating expenses we allocate the total costs for information technology  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of the functional areas based on worldwide headcount data 
information technology allocated costs include salaries  employee related costs  outside consulting costs for internal projects  communication costs  hardware and software maintenance contracts costs and depreciation expense for fixed assets 
facilities allocated costs include facility rent for the corporate offices as well as shared function offices  property taxes  and certain other department operating costs 
fixed asset depreciation allocated costs include straight line depreciation expense on buildings  leasehold improvements  computer equipment  software  furniture and office equipment 
the general increases in absolute dollars in selling and marketing  product development and engineering costs relates primarily to increases in personnel expenses and consulting expenses 
the impact foreign exchange rate movements did not have a significant impact on our operating expenses 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of product and other marketing related expenses  compensation related expenses  sales commissions  facility costs and travel costs 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages selling and marketing as a percentage of total revenues the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased employee related costs  increased travel and entertainment together with increased costs for promotional events partially offset by a decrease in distributor commissions of million 
the employee related costs  increased by million as compared to fiscal  
table of contents primarily related to our continued investment in our sales organization 
in addition  travel and entertainment and promotional events increased by approximately million in aggregate due to increased investment in marketing and promotional expenditures to strengthen the wind river brand 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
this increase was attributable to higher employee related costs of million due to an increased investment in the sales organization and higher revenues 
in addition distributor commissions increased by  as a result of increased use of distributor and sales agents  and advertising and marketing costs increased by  the increases were partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of million  arising from a lower depreciable base of short lived fixed assets and million due to a decrease in rent and other facility costs 
selling and marketing expenses declined as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the fixed elements being spread over a higher revenue base 
we expect an increase in selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in both the short and long term as we continue to focus on long term growth in the areas of sales and marketing personnel and marketing and advertising programs 
product development and engineering expenses 
product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of payroll related expenses  facility costs and consulting fees for our product research and development organization 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages product development and engineering as a percentage of net revenues the increase in product development and engineering expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
this increase was primarily due to increases in overall expenditures in research and development programs to ensure that our products continue to meet customer demands 
during fiscal compared to fiscal  salaries and related fringe benefits costs increased by approximately million due primarily to increased headcount and external consultant costs increased by approximately million 
in addition  amounts capitalized in relation to software development in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  sfas no 
and cost offset for funded research and development decreased by approximately million thereby resulting in an increase in net expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in product development and engineering expenses were partially offset by a decrease in engineering incentive program expense of million in addition to certain other cost efficiencies 
the increase in product development and engineering expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries and fringe benefits of million  the addition of an engineering incentive program totaling million and an increase in consulting and outside costs of  these increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of million due to a lower base of depreciable assets and savings in several other areas 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 we capitalized million of product development expenses in fiscal in connection with the release of vxworks and workbench  both of which were major product releases 
the related costs is being be amortized over two years as a component of cost of revenues 
there were no capitalized software development costs in fiscal or fiscal we expect that product development and engineering expenses in absolute dollars will not increase significantly in the short term 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses  facilities related expenses and external fees for professional services  such as legal and accounting 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million and was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses of million  salary and related benefit costs of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in external accounting and consultant costs of  the increase in legal expenses was primarily due to outside counsel fees associated with legal proceedings and claims 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly as compared to due to the increase in revenues and the fixed nature of certain of these costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was or million and was primarily a result of general cost saving initiatives realized from restructuring activities in fiscal and from previous restructurings 
we realized million in payroll related cost reductions in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was offset by an increase of  in attestation services  primarily due to the additional requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  and tax services 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in the short term 
we expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we invest in worldwide staff and infrastructure in the areas of information systems and finance and administration 
goodwill 
we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as required by sfas no 
in the second quarter of fiscal  and as of june we currently operate in one segment  which is also the only reporting unit for the purposes of sfas the primary methods used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes were the income and market approach 
the income approach provides an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit based on the discounted cash flows derived from the reporting unit s estimated remaining life plus any residual value 
the market approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based upon a comparison to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
the assumptions supporting the income approach  including the discount rate  which was assumed to be for fiscal and for fiscal and  were determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
we completed our evaluation under both methods and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  including goodwill 
there were no circumstances since the annual impairment test date through january   that indicated a further assessment was necessary 
amortization of other intangibles percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages amortization of other intangibles as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in amortization of other intangibles for fiscal compared to and compared to was due to a lower amortizable base of other intangible assets 
in january  we acquired the assets and obligations of the scopetools business unit of real time innovations  inc and recorded  in intangible 
table of contents assets  other than goodwill which are expected to be amortized to operating expenses over a two to seven year period on a straight line basis 
impairment of purchased intangibles percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages impairment of purchased intangibles as a percentage of net revenues there were no goodwill or purchased intangibles impairment for fiscal or during the second quarter of fiscal  we identified a possible impairment of goodwill and certain purchased technologies relating to a previous acquisition 
the impairment was based on a change in the long term strategic plan for these purchased technologies following a deterioration in the business climate and changes in sales and cash flow forecasts 
accordingly  we compared the undiscounted cash flows associated with such acquired business and long lived assets with the respective carrying amounts and determined that an impairment of certain of these assets existed 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million related to purchased technologies during fiscal the impaired amount was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges consist of costs associated with restructuring programs  impairment charges  a settlement with our former chief executive officer and a settlement of litigation and related remediation efforts 
during fiscal  total restructuring and other charges of million comprised million related to restructured expenses and  of other charges related to impairment of leasehold improvements 
restructuring charges 
we recorded net restructuring charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which in each case were recorded as operating expenses 
our restructuring plans have been based on certain assumptions regarding the optimal cost structure of our business and our ability to support profitable growth in the future 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of employee positions in fiscal  employee positions in fiscal  employee positions in fiscal and employee positions in fiscal our restructuring program for fiscal was initiated prior to our adoption of sfas no

we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional financing when required in sufficient amounts on terms acceptable to us  our business could suffer 
we currently plan to reinvest our cash generated from operations in new short and long term investments  in high quality financial  government  and corporate securities or other investments  consistent with past investment practices  and therefore net cash used in investing activities may increase 
however  cash could also be used in the future for acquisitions or strategic investments 
cash may also be used to repurchase equity under our stock repurchase program or to repurchase additional subordinated convertible notes

we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options for disclosure purposes and we are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we have elected to use the prospective transition method which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is our first quarter of fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

the adoption of sfas no 
r and sab will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  specifically our statement of operations and earnings per share on a quarterly and annual basis  as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is its current practice 
the amounts disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no

table of contents and sab may differ materially from amounts currently disclosed based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb completed its review of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and marketable equity securities and investments accounted for under the cost method should be considered other than temporary and recognized in income 
eitf also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the fasb decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment but has issued fasb staff position fsp and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which nullifies the accounting guidance on the determination of whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired as set forth in eitf fsp and are effective on a prospective basis for other than temporary impairments on certain investments in reporting periods beginning after december  eitf was effective december  and will remain in effect until the adoption of fsp and wind river has complied with its disclosure requirements  which were initially presented in wind river s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of fsp and will have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas no 

this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for voluntary changes or when there is no transition guidance provided  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
we have an investment policy that has been approved by our board of directors 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

table of contents we believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting our floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our pretax earnings 
we also believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our fixed income securities 
our investment portfolio consists of various marketable debt securities 
the longer the duration of these securities  the more susceptible these securities are to general changes in market interest rates 
as general market interest rates increase  those securities purchased with a lower yield at cost will likely show a mark to market unrealized loss 
all unrealized losses are due to changes in general market interest rates and bond yields 
we expect to realize the full value of all these investments upon their maturity 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to certain non functional currency related inter company and other balances 
transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in other income expense  net 
as of january   we had outstanding contracts with the following terms usd equivalent or currency amount  in thousands buy sell sell buy sell buy buy currency gbp euro jpy cad cad sek kr amount rate usd equivalent maturity date we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of january   the fair value of the above contracts was not significant 
the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our forward exchange contracts is minimal due to the short maturities of the contracts 
equity price risk our equity price risk related to equity investments is minimal due to the immaterial carrying amounts of our equity investments
