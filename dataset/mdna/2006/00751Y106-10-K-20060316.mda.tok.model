item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under forward looking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december of each year 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks  with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal which consisted of weeks due to our week fiscal year in introduction we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry  which includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks  vans  minivans and sport utility vehicles 
we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items to do it yourself  or diy  customers in the united states  based on store count and sales 
our operations are conducted in one reportable segment 

table of contents at december   we operated  stores throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
these stores operated under the advance auto parts trade name except for certain stores in the state of florida  which operated under the advance discount auto parts trade name 
these stores offer automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items  with no significant concentration in any specific product area 
in addition  we operated stores under the western auto and advance auto parts trade names  located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands 
the western auto stores offer automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items 
at december   we also operated stores under the autopart international trade name throughout the northeastern region of the united states 
the following table sets forth the total number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and we lease approximately of our stores 
fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores a closed stores number of stores  end of period b relocated stores stores with commercial delivery programs c a includes stores acquired in fiscal as a result of our autopart international acquisition and stores acquired in fiscal as a result of our lappen auto supply acquisition 
b includes stores not operating at december   primarily due to hurricane damage 
c includes ai stores operating at december  we anticipate adding approximately to new aap stores during  excluding any acquisitions during management overview in  we produced solid earnings primarily reflective of our continued sales momentum and gross margin improvements 
these results helped us generate strong cash flow and drive a higher return on our invested capital 
our strong sales were primarily driven by an increase in comparable store net sales for the year  our highest comparative sales increase as a public company 
additionally  our average net sales per store rose to more than million  which is one of the highest among our major competitors 
we remain focused on the following four goals rasing average sales per store  expancing operating margins  generating strong free cash flow  and increasing return on invested capital 
we believe our results also reflect the progress made on the following key initiatives that focus specifically on driving higher sales per store and leveraging our fixed expenses improving store execution towards best in class in automotive aftermarket retail  continued execution of our category management program  continued implementation of our store remodeling program  now resulting in more than of our chain remodeled  our focus on making our supply chain more responsive and improving our in stock position  consistent growth and execution of our commercial program  
table of contents our focus on recruiting  training and retaining high performing team member  especially those who are ase certified and or bilingual  and enhanced national advertising 
beyond the implementation of our key business initiatives  various conditions that impact our industry continue to remain strong 
the number of registered vehicles on the road is at an all time high and continues to increase 
the average age of vehicles also continues to increase and is now over nine years old 
additionally  technological changes in newer models and the shift from cars to light trucks and sport utility vehicles have resulted in more expensive replacement parts for these vehicles 
we believe the combination of our execution on key business initiatives and favorable industry dynamics will continue to drive our earnings per share growth into the foreseeable future 
the following table highlights certain operating results and key metrics for  and fiscal year total net sales in thousands total commercial net sales in thousands comparable store net sales growth diy comparable store net sales growth difm comparable store net sales growth average net sales per store in thousands inventory per store in thousands inventory turnover gross margin operating margin note these metrics should be reviewed along with the footnotes to the table setting forth our selected store data in item selected financial data located elsewhere in this report

key events the following key events occurred during began servicing stores from our new northeast distribution center  acquired substantially all of the assets of lappen auto supply  completed the acquisition of autopart international  inc  commenced a new million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors  effected a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend  suffered structural damages and disruptions created by three major hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  and completed the physical conversion of our florida stores acquired from discount auto parts 

table of contents acquisitions on september   we completed the acquisition of autopart international  inc  or ai 
the acquisition  which included stores throughout new england and new york  a distribution center and ai s wholesale distribution business  will complement our growing presence in the northeast 
ai s business serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse distributors and jobbers 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  ai s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date 
the purchase price of million  inclusive of contingent consideration of million payable no later than april  based upon ai satisfying certain earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization targets met through december   has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the date of acquisition 
this allocation resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
furthermore  an additional million is contingently payable based upon the achievement of certain synergies  as defined in the purchase agreement  through fiscal  which will be reflected in the statement of operations when earned 
in july  we also completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of lappen auto supply  including stores in the greater boston metro area 
stock repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock plus related expenses 
the program  which became effective august   replaced the remaining portion of a million stock repurchase program that had been authorized by our board of directors during third quarter of fiscal the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
stock split on august   our board of directors declared a three for two stock split of our common stock  effected as a stock dividend 
the dividend was distributed on september  to holders of record as of september   and our stock began trading on a post split basis on september  our results reflect the effect of the stock split for all years represented 
hurricane and fire impact during the second half of fiscal  hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma impacted our operations throughout the states of alabama  florida  louisiana  mississippi and texas 
at the time these storms hit  we operated approximately stores throughout these states 
over of these locations experienced some kind of physical damage and even more suffered sales disruptions 
additionally  we believe we experienced sales disruptions resulting from the economic impact of increased fuel prices on our customer base throughout all of our markets immediately following these hurricanes 
we also incurred and recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating our team members for scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided to our team members and their families 
while these sales disruptions and related incremental expenses are not recoverable from our insurance carrier  the insurance coverage provides for the recovery of physical damage at cost  damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged capital assets at replacement cost 
additionally  during fiscal we lost two store locations due to fire 
for the year ended december   we estimated and reflected in earnings the fixed costs of all damage offset by the realizable insurance recoveries  net of deductibles 
accordingly  earnings for reflect the recovery of substantially all of these fixed costs 
a portion of these recoveries includes the settlement with our insurance carrier for the retail value of certain damaged inventory 
moreover  we may receive additional recoveries beyond our recorded receivable as we settle additional claims for damaged inventory at retail value and for damaged capital assets at replacement value 

table of contents commercial program as indicated in the operating results table above  our commercial program produced strong revenues during fiscal we attribute this performance to the execution of our commercial plan  which consists of targeting commercial customers with a hard parts focus  targeting commercial customers who need access to a wide selection of inventory  moving inventory closer to our commercial customers to ensure quicker deliveries  growing our market share of the commercial market through internal growth and selected acquisitions  providing trained parts experts to assist commercial customers merchandise selections  and providing credit solutions to our commercial customers through our commercial credit program 
commercial sales represented approximately of our consolidated total sales for the fiscal year compared to almost in fiscal at december   we operated commercial programs in of our stores  including the ai stores  up from approximately at the end of the prior fiscal year 
we anticipate growing our number of commercial programs to approximately of our total store base over time 
we believe we have the potential to grow profitably our share of the commercial business in each of our markets 
we believe the continued execution of our commercial plan and growth in our commercial programs will result in double digit comparable store net sales growth in our commercial business for the foreseeable future 
we believe the acquisition of ai will supplement our commercial growth due to ai s established delivery programs and knowledge of the commercial industry  particularly for foreign makes and models of vehicles 
discontinued operations prior to  we operated a wholesale distribution segment under the trade name western auto 
on december   we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network 
the wholesale distribution network  or wholesale  consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations  for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services 
due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area  it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively 
this component of our business operated in the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of million for fiscal year  represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment 
we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january  to reflect this decision 
for the fiscal year ended january   the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale business were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 
vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional considerations 
we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of the incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis 
certain vendors require us to use cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising 
we define these allowances as 
table of contents restricted cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred 
the remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to inventory and recognized through cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same 
short term incentives terms less than one year are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets 
inventory reserves we establish reserves for inventory shrink  as an increase to our cost of sales  for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program 
our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program  which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures 
we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 
we have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors  the level of credit provided by the vendor and management s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost  if any  required by market conditions 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
warranty reserves our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims 
we are responsible for merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries 
we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
self insured reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost  which we calculate using analyses of historical data  demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by third party actuaries 
management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding selling  general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 

table of contents leases and leasehold improvements we lease certain store locations  distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
certain leases contain rent escalation clauses  which are recorded on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent recorded as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
in addition  leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms 
the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised 
in those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 
closed store liabilities we recognize a reserve for future obligations at the time we close a leased store location 
the reserve includes the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management s estimate of future costs for common area maintenance and taxes  offset by the present value of management s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts 
these estimates are based on current market conditions and our experience of obtaining subleases or buyouts on similar properties 
however  our inability to enter into subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves and could impact our selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets we primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware 
we periodically review our store locations and estimate the recoverability of our assets  recording an impairment charge  if necessary  when we decide to close the store or otherwise determine that future undiscounted cash flows associated with those assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including the store s historical operating results and cash flows  estimated future sales growth  real estate development in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to change 
in addition  we regularly evaluate our computer related and other long lived assets and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced or has limited future value 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that period 
tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the code  regulations  pronouncements and applicable case law of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
applying these complex rules requires significant judgment 
we believe our tax positions are fully supportable  but we establish reserves for certain positions which may be successfully challenged 
these reserves are adjusted  on a facts and circumstances basis  as challenges are resolved or the relevant tax guidance evolves 
components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods 
we 
table of contents include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
we exclude net sales from the western auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique product offerings 
we also plan to exclude the net sales from the ai stores from our comparable store sales 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december and consists of or weeks 
our fiscal year began on january  and consisted of weeks  while our fiscal year began on december  and consisted of weeks 
the extra week of operations in fiscal resulted in our fiscal consisting of non comparable calendar weeks to fiscal to create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal  we have compared the calendar weeks of to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal accordingly  our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal excludes week one of operations from fiscal cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members  store support center administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended december  january  january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses expenses associated with merger and integration operating income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt other income  net income tax expense income from continuing operations before discontinued operations discontinued operations loss income from operations of discontinued wholesale distribution network benefit provision for income taxes loss income on discontinued operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of  contributions from the new stores opened within the last year and sales from acquired operations 
the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and a slight increase in customer traffic 
we believe these results reflect the 
table of contents execution of the key business initiatives discussed previously in the management overview 
in addition  we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial plan as discussed previously in the commercial program 
gross profit for was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management program in the form of better margins on key product categories and increased incentives under our vendor programs and supply chain efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  million  or of net sales for  as compared to  million  or of net sales for for fiscal  we experienced a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales resulting from our ability to leverage our strong comparable store sales and lower self insurance expense partially offset by higher fuel and energy costs 
interest expense for was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in interest expense is a result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates as compared to fiscal income tax expense for was million  as compared to million for this increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher earnings

we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share for  as compared to million  or per diluted share for as a percentage of sales  net income for was  as compared to for the earnings per share results reflect the effect of a three for two stock split of our common stock distributed on september  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for excluding the effect of the rd week for our net sales increased million  or  over net sales for the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of and contributions from our new stores opened during fiscal the comparable store sales increase was primarily the result of increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales 
overall  we believe our store format  category management and enhanced nationwide advertising program drove our growth in net sales 
in addition  we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial delivery programs in our existing markets and our continued focus on a high level of service to our difm customers 
gross profit for was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflect continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and reduced inventory shrinkage 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  million  or of net sales for  from  million  or of net sales for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in was primarily a result of increased expenses associated with our self insurance programs  including the increased costs required to close claims below our stop loss limits and increased medical costs for covered team members due to inflation in the health care sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included million in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount 
these integration expenses were related to  among other things  overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses 
excluding the merger and integration expenses from  selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales 
interest expense for was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates due primarily to our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  the decrease resulted from lower average outstanding debt levels on our senior credit facility 
table of contents throughout fiscal as compared to fiscal income tax expense for was million  as compared to million for this increase in income tax expense primarily reflected our higher earnings 
our effective income tax rate was for both and we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share for  as compared to million  or per diluted share for as a percentage of sales  net income for was  as compared to for our net income for included the effect of expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt of million  or per diluted share 
these per share amounts reflect the three for two stock split declared in quarterly financial results in thousands  except per share data weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks ended ended ended ended ended ended ended ended net sales gross profit net income net income per share basic diluted amounts reflect the effect of a three for two stock split of our common stock distributed on september  liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures and contractual obligations 
in addition  we have used available funds to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our senior credit facility as needed 
at december   our cash balance was million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal year end our cash balance decreased primarily due to cash invested in business acquisitions during  partially offset by cash generated from our increased earnings during as compared to at december   we had outstanding indebtedness consisting primarily of borrowings of million under our senior credit facility  a decrease of million from additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
capital expenditures our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program  including new store openings and store acquisitions  store relocations and remodels  inventory requirements  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our acquisitions 
our capital expenditures were million in these amounts included costs related to new store openings  the upgrade of our information systems  remodels and relocations of existing stores  including the completion of our physical conversion of stores acquired in the discount acquisition to our advance auto parts store format 
in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 

table of contents our new stores  if leased  require capital expenditures of approximately  per store and an inventory investment of approximately  per store  net of vendor payables 
a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility 
pre opening expenses  consisting primarily of store set up costs and training of new store team members  average approximately  per store and are expensed when incurred 
our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the number of stores we relocate or remodel 
during fiscal  we opened stores  including stores acquired as part of the acquisitions of ai and lappen auto supply 
we anticipate adding at least to new stores during fiscal  excluding any acquisitions 
vendor financing program historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth  and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms 
in fiscal  we entered into a short term financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases 
in substance  the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors 
this program allows us to reduce further our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth 
our capacity under this program increased million to million during fiscal at december   million was payable to the bank by us under this program 
stock repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock plus related expenses 
the program  which became effective august   replaced the remaining portion of a million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in fiscal the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions form time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares of common stock under the new program  at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share  excluding related expenses 
under our previous stock repurchase program  we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price per share  excluding related expenses 
at december   million of stock repurchases remained unsettled 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we also retired million shares of common stock  of which million shares were repurchased under the million stock repurchase plan  and million shares were repurchased under our previous million stock repurchase program 
at december   we had million  excluding related expenses  available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program 
as of march   we had repurchased an additional million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
deferred compensation and postretirement plans we maintain a non qualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members 
this plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus  as determined by our retirement plan committee 
we fund the plan liability by remitting the team members deferrals to a rabbi trust where these deferrals are invested in certain life insurance contracts 
accordingly  the cash surrender value on these contracts is held in the rabbi trust to fund the deferred compensation liability 
at december   the liability related to this plan was million  all of which is current 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan 
at december   our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was million 
the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid incurred 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially determined 
the discount rate utilized at december  and january  was and  respectively 
we reserve the right to change or terminate the 
table of contents benefits or contributions at any time 
we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs 
any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense 
effective second quarter of  we amended the plan to exclude outpatient prescription drug benefits to medicare eligible retirees effective january  due to this negative plan amendment  our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by million  resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount 
the unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the year estimated remaining life expectancy of the plan participants

significant components of this increase consisted of million increase from higher net income before the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization over fiscal  million increase in cash flow  primarily resulting from the reduction in trade receivables upon the sale of our private label credit card portfolio  decrease as a result of higher inventory levels needed for our northeast distribution center and expansion of the number of stores which carry an extended mix of parts  million increase in other assets primarily due to timing in the payment of our monthly rent  million increase in accounts payable reflective of the increase in inventory discussed above  and million increase in accrued expenses related to the timing of payments for normal operating expenses

we were in compliance with the above covenants at december  credit ratings at december   we had a credit rating on our senior credit facility from standard poor s of bb and a credit rating of ba from moody s investor service 
the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our senior credit facility is based on such credit ratings 
if these credit ratings decline  our interest expense may increase 
conversely  if these credit ratings increase  our interest expense may decrease 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in november the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
and subsequently issued stock option related guidance 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the grant date fair value of employee 
table of contents share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
we are required to apply sfas no 
r to all stock or stock based awards outstanding and subsequently granted  modified or settled as of january  sfas no 
r requires us to use either the modified prospective method or modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we must recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption 
under the modified retrospective method  we must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  sfas no 
r permits the use of either the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
we have completed our analysis of the impact of sfas no 
r 
we have decided to use the modified prospective method of implementation as of january  we plan to use the black scholes option pricing model to value all options and straight line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the required service period
