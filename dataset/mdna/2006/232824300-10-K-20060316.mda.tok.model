we cannot assure you of the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses  if ever 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  we may sell equity  debt or other securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities

we also pay bms mi a variable amount per month for each quadramet order placed to cover the costs of customer service 
in addition  we expect our quadramet sales and marketing expenses to increase in beginning in december  we began to equally share the costs of the joint venture with progenics 
in  cytogen and progenics each provided funding of million to the joint venture 
as of march   we and progenics have not agreed on a work plan and annual budget for for the joint venture

in august  we received million from elan corporation  plc in exchange for a convertible promissory note 
the note bore annual interest of  however  such interest was not payable in cash  but was added to the principal of the note through august  thereafter interest was paid in cash 
in august  we made a payment of million to satisfy our obligations on the promissory note and unpaid accrued interest 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement our planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further our marketing and sales programs 
we expect that our existing capital resources should be adequate to fund our operations and commitments at least into we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we expect that we will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when we reach profitability  for further product development costs  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including i the successful commercialization of our products  ii the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  iii progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  iv progress with clinical trials  v progress with regulatory affairs activities  vi the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  vii competing technological and market developments  and viii the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of our products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds 
table of contents through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
we cannot assure you that the financial sources described above will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition product related revenues include product sales by us to our customers and quadramet royalties earned by us prior to august product sales are recognized when the customer takes ownership of the products and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
product returns are accepted under limited circumstances and are estimated based upon historical experience 
we may provide rebates and volume discounts to our customers from time to time 
such rebates and discounts are recorded as a reduction of product sales when earned by the customer 
prior to the reacquisition of quadramet from our marketing partner berlex laboratories in august  we recognized royalty revenue on quadramet sales made by berlex  during each period as berlex sold the product 
as a result of the reacquisition  effective august  we began recognizing revenue from the sales of quadramet and no longer receive quadramet royalty revenue 
license and contract revenues include milestone payments and fees under collaborative agreements with third parties  revenues from research services  and revenues from other miscellaneous sources 
in  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab replaced staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which the company adopted in the provisions related to non refundable  up front license fees were unchanged in sab compared to sab accordingly  we defer up front license fees and recognize them over the estimated performance period of the related agreement  when we have continuing involvement 
since the term of the performance periods is subject to management s estimates  future revenues to be recognized could be affected by changes in such estimates 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for uncollectible accounts if the future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as a limited number of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues  and corresponding receivables 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method  which most closely reflects the physical flow of our inventories 
our products and raw materials are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly review quantities on hand to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product sales 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
carrying value of fixed and intangible assets our fixed assets and certain of our acquired rights to market our products have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
adverse changes regarding future cash flows to be received from long lived assets could indicate that an impairment exists  and would require the write down of the carrying value of the impaired asset at that time 
warrant liability we follow emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock which provides guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity  temporary equity and assets and liabilities 
under eitf  to qualify as permanent equity  the equity derivative must permit us to settle in unregistered shares 
we do not have that ability under the securities purchase agreement for the warrants issued in july and august and  as eitf considers the ability to keep a registration statement effective as beyond our control  the warrants cannot be classified as permanent equity and are instead classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we record the warrant liability at its fair value using a black scholes option pricing model and remeasure it at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expired 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as non operating income or expense 
the fair value of the warrants is subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in our stock price  expected volatility  expected life  the risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the warrants issued in july and august new accounting pronouncements abnormal inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas in our fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect that the adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
share based payment in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
and superseded apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with grants of stock options and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule allowing companies to implement 
table of contents sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after june  accordingly  we have adopted sfas no 
r in our fiscal year beginning january  we currently expect to use the modified prospective method of adoption and therefore will not restate our prior year results 
under the new standard  compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instrument on the grant date 
this pronouncement applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
sfas no 
r eliminates our ability to account for such transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by us 
sfas no 
r also requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with purchases of shares of common stock by employees at a discount to market value under employee stock purchase plans that do not meet certain criteria 
although we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard  it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
our exposure to market risk is principally confined to interest rate sensitivity 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
we are exposed to certain risks arising from changes in the price of our common stock  primarily due to the potential effect of changes in fair value of the warrant liability related to the warrants issued in july and august the warrant liability is measured at fair value using a black scholes option pricing model at each reporting date and is subject to significant increases or decreases in value and a corresponding loss or gain in the statement of operations due to the effects of changes in the price of common stock at period end and the related calculation of volatility
