excess and surplus lines 
excess and surplus lines carriers focus on risks that the standard admitted market is unwilling or unable to underwrite due to the unique risk characteristics of the insureds or the lack of insurers offering such coverage  which may be caused by physical perils  the nature of the business or the insured s loss experience

competition the company s principal competitors cannot be easily classified 
the company s principal lines of business are written by numerous other insurance companies 
competition for any one account may come from very large national firms or smaller regional companies 
competition within the excess and surplus lines marketplace comes from a wide range of carriers 
in addition to mature companies which operate nationwide  there is competition from carriers formed over the past several years to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
our e s segment may also compete with national and regional carriers from the standard market willing to write selected accounts on an admitted basis 
due to the diverse nature of the products offered by the select markets segment  competition comes from various sources 
the majority of the competition comes from regional companies or regional subsidiaries of national carriers 
national carriers tend to compete for larger accounts along all product lines 
the public entity segment s competition is primarily from small to medium size commercial insurers as well as from state and regional risk pools 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are rated by am best 
am best s ratings are used by insurance buyers  agents and brokers and other insurance companies as an indicator of financial strength and security  and are not intended to reflect the quality of the rated company for investment purposes 
am best assigns ratings ranging from a superior to f in liquidation 
a 
m 
best has rated the company s insurance subsidiaries as follows argonaut insurance company as an a excellent with a negative outlook  colony and rockwood as an a excellent with a stable outlook  and great central as an a excellent with a stable outlook 
in november  standard poor s upgraded its financial strength rating of the company s insurance subsidiaries to a  with a stable outlook 
standard poor s also upgraded its counterparty credit rating for argonaut group  inc to bbb  also with a stable outlook 
the rating agencies review the ratings on a periodic basis  and ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries are therefore subject to change or withdrawal at any time 
a significant downgrade in these ratings could affect the company s competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for the company to market its products and result in a material loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings 
no assurance can be given that the company s primary insurance subsidiaries can maintain these ratings 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
to remain competitive  the company s strategy includes  among other measures  focusing on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline  leveraging its distribution network  controlling expenses  maintaining financial strength and counterparty credit ratings  providing quality services to agents and policyholders and acquiring suitable property and casualty books of business 
regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of the states in which they are domiciled 
such supervision and regulation is designed to protect the company s policyholders rather than the company s shareholders 
such supervision and regulation includes matters relating to authorized lines of business  underwriting standards  financial condition standards  licensing of insurers  investment standards  premium levels  policy provisions  the filing of annual and other financial reports prepared on the basis of statutory accounting principles  the filing and form of actuarial reports  dividends  and a variety of other financial and non financial matters 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s insurance subsidiaries are participants of the statutorily created insolvency guarantee associations in all states where they are admitted licensed carriers 
these associations were formed for the purpose of paying claims of insolvent companies 
the company is assessed its pro rata share of such claims based upon its premium writings  subject to a maximum annual assessment per line of insurance 
such costs can generally be recovered through surcharges on future premiums 
the company does not believe that assessments on current insolvencies will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company  as an insurance holding company  is subject to regulation by certain states 
all states have enacted legislation which regulates insurance holding companies such as the company and its subsidiaries 
this legislation generally provides that each insurance company in the holding company is required to register with the department of insurance of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the group 
such regulation generally provides that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable 
transfers of assets among such affiliated companies  certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system may be subject to prior notice to  or prior approval by  state regulatory authorities 
as an insurance holding company  the company is largely dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its insurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its shareholders  debt service and for its operating capital 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the company is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the states of domicile that regulate the company s immediate insurance subsidiaries  which are california for argonaut insurance company and virginia for colony insurance company 
no dividends were paid to the company by the insurance subsidiaries during during  argonaut insurance company may be permitted to pay dividends of up to million in cash to the company without approval from the california department of insurance  while colony insurance company may be permitted to pay dividends of up to million in cash without approval from the virginia department of insurance 
business and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of dividends actually paid  and prior approval of dividend payments may be required 
reinsurance as is common practice within the insurance industry  the company s insurance subsidiaries transfers a portion of the risks insured under their policies by entering into a reinsurance treaty with another insurance company 
purchasing reinsurance protects primary carriers against the severity of losses incurred on the policies they issue  such as in the case of unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims on one policy aggregate to produce an extraordinary loss on one policy or where a catastrophe generates a large number of serious claims on multiple policies at the same time 
reinsurance does not discharge the issuing primary carrier from its obligation to pay a policyholder for losses insured under its policy 
rather  the reinsured portion of each loss covered under a reinsurance treaty is ceded to the assuming reinsurer for reimbursement to the primary carrier 
because this creates a receivable owed by the reinsurer to the primary carrier  there is credit exposure with respect to losses ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under its reinsurance treaty 
the ability to collect on reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers  interpretation of contract language and other factors 
the company is selective in regard to its reinsurers  seeking out those with strong financial strength ratings from a 
m 
best or standard and poor s 
however  the financial condition of a reinsurer may change over time based on market conditions 
the company performs credit reviews on its reinsurers  focusing on  among other things  financial condition  stability  trends and commitment to the reinsurance business 
the company also requires deposit of assets in trust  letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from certain reinsurers whose financial strength ratings fall below a certain level or who transact business on a non admitted basis in the state where the company s insurance subsidiary is domiciled 
however  due to the company s longevity  it has not always been standard business practice to require security for balances due  therefore  certain balances are not collateralized 
a reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
much of the company s reinsurance is secured on an excess of loss basis 
under an excess of loss arrangement  the insurance subsidiaries retain losses on claims to a specified amount and the reinsurers assume any losses above that amount 
the company s retention limits vary by business segment 
as of december   retention limits by segment were as follows e s  retention per occurrence  with a maximum retention of million per occurrence in limited cases  select markets  to  per occurrence  public entity  per occurrence  risk management million per occurrence  with facultative placements being utilized on a policy by policy basis to reduce the retention to  in certain situations 
in addition to the above coverages  each year the company purchases a combined package of excess of loss property catastrophe reinsurance a property cat treaty for all business segments exposed to property losses ie excluding risk management 
this coverage is purchased to provide the company with protection against high severity property loss events such as hurricanes  earthquakes and other catastrophes 
the property cat treaty in effect as of year end provides the company with coverage for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by the company on a per occurrence basis  net of amounts recovered by the company under any other reinsurance treaties applicable to the same occurrence 
coverage is provided within five defined layers of loss limits 
table of contents 
index to financial statements layer of million excess of million applies only to select markets and public entity  layer of million excess of million  layer of million excess of million  layer of million excess of million  layer of million excess of million 
the property cat treaty described above provides the company with coverage for each occurrence associated with a catastrophe loss event during its term  which is scheduled to be renewed in may of should the limit of coverage for all occurrences within a particular layer of the property cat treaty be exhausted during prior to the expiration of its term  the company is entitled to replenish such coverage through purchase of a reinstatement 
a reinstatement makes available one additional full limit of coverage within its layer to cover losses from future catastrophic events occurring during the remaining term of the property cat treaty 
the company may purchase one reinstatement for each of layers   and and two reinstatements for layer under the property cat treaty in effect as of year end through the end of its term in may of at any given time  the maximum amount of coverage available to the company under a particular layer of the property cat treaty for all events occurring during its term can be determined by adding a the amount of the layer s original stated per occurrence coverage limit and  b the amount of the layer s stated per occurrence coverage limit multiplied by the total number of reinstatements afforded for that layer 
during the third and fourth quarter of  three catastrophic hurricanes katrina  rita  wilma made landfall in the southeastern united states and caused unprecedented losses among our policyholders 
the company ceded million in losses under the property cat treaty described above and paid premiums for reinstatements in the amount of million in connection with these hurricanes 
following these events  the company purchased additional excess of loss property catastrophe reinsurance to supplement the maximum amount of coverage which remained available under its existing property cat treaty 
the company purchased additional reinsurance for losses falling within the third layer of its existing property cat treaty effective september  and for the second layer effective november  these purchases provide coverage equal to one additional stated per occurrence coverage limit for each layer for losses arising out of any subsequent catastrophic events during the remaining term of the property cat treaty 
at december   the company s had coverage remaining within its catastrophe loss property catastrophe reinsurance program as follow layer occurrence limits exhausted  layer one full occurrence limit plus  remaining for a second occurrence  layer one full occurrence limit remaining  layer of one full occurrence limit million remaining  layer one full occurrence limit plus million remaining for a second occurrence 
as a result of the four hurricanes that made landfall in the southeastern united states in the third quarter of  the company ceded approximately million in losses and incurred reinstatement premiums in the amount of million under the property cat treaty previously in effect which covered losses from that period 
the company also purchases reinsurance for catastrophe losses which might be incurred on policies issued for workers compensation coverage 
effective january   the company purchased workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance providing coverage for losses in excess of million up to a limit of million with one reinstatement available 
maximum coverage provided for any one life under the terms of the contract is million 
during  the company incurred no losses that would have been covered under its workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance program in effect for the year 
the company also utilizes a variety of other reinsurance products to reduce the associated risk 
these programs are implemented on an as needed basis 
during  the company had over  million of gross written premiums of which it ceded  or transferred to reinsurers  approximately million  or of gross written premiums  for reinsurance protection 
as of december   the company had approximately million of paid losses recoverable coupled with approximately million of ceded loss reserves from reinsurers for losses that they are or will likely be obligated to reimburse the company

the company regularly monitors its reinsurers for credit quality to assess their ability to pay 
certain of the company s reinsurers have experienced deteriorating financial condition and have been downgraded by rating agencies 
the company regularly assesses these reinsurers to determine the collectibility of amounts due 
the company is in dispute with certain reinsurers regarding the circumstances giving rise to reinsured claims  or the applicability of reinsurance contract provisions related to reinsurance balances due the company 
the reserve for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate based upon its assessment of reinsurer s ability to pay reinsurance balances  and management s assessment regarding the likelihood of collecting disputed balances 
it is possible that future financial deterioration of the company s reinsurers  or the inability of the company to prevail in resolving disputed balances  could result in the uncollectibility of certain balances and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and or financial condition 
included in balances due from reinsurers in the risk management segment is million due from trenwick america reinsurance corporation trenwick  a subsidiary of trenwick group  ltd  related to the commutation of a reinsurance treaty with trenwick 
the company commuted this trenwick treaty on december  and expects to receive million pending approval from certain regulatory authorities

the million reduction of ceded loss reserves represents management s best estimate of losses that will be retained by the company as a result of commuting this treaty 
the company has approximately million of reinsurance balances due for other reinsurance contracts with trenwick  and these balances remain current as to payment 
the company entered into a retroactive adverse loss development reinsurance agreement the agreement with inter ocean na reinsurance company  ltd

the company cannot be assured that reinsurance will remain continuously available to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
if the company is unable to maintain its current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that are considered sufficient  the company would either have to be willing to accept an increase in its net exposures or reduce its premium writings 
since the events of september   reinsurers have generally included terrorism exclusions or limits in their reinsurance agreements 
although this has not materially affected

additional information relating to the company s reinsurance activities is included under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages and note reinsurance in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the company records reserves for specific claims incurred and reported and reserves for claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates of losses for reported claims are established judgmentally on an individual case basis 
such estimates are based on the company s particular experience with the type of risk involved and its knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim 
reserves for reported claims consider the company s estimate of the ultimate cost to settle the claims  including investigation and defense of the claim  and may be adjusted for differences between costs originally estimated and costs re estimated or incurred 
reserves for incurred but not reported claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims  including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors  using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience 
the company uses a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
reserves established in prior years are adjusted as loss experience develops and new information becomes available 
adjustments to previously estimated reserves are reflected in results in the year in which they are made 
the estimate of reinsurance balances recoverable related to reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the portion of the gross liabilities that are anticipated to be recovered from reinsurers 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are recognized as assets at the same time as and in a manner consistent with the gross losses associated with the reinsured policies 
the company is subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on its business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  power outages  severe winter weather  fires and by man made events  such as terrorist attacks 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for catastrophes until such event takes place 
therefore  although the company actively manages its exposure to catastrophes through its underwriting process and the purchase of reinsurance protection  an especially severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could exceed its reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and or financial condition 
the terrorism peril is deemed by the company to include the damage resulting from various terrorist attacks through either conventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear or radioactive explosive devices as well as chemical and biological contaminants 
the company continues to review its underwriting data in accessing aggregate exposure to this peril 
the company underwrites against the risk of terrorism with a philosophy of avoidance wherever possible 
for both property and casualty exposures  this is accomplished through the use of portfolio tracking tools which identify high risk areas  as well as areas of potential concentration 
the company estimates the probable maximum loss from each risk as well as for the portfolio in total and factors this analysis into the underwriting and reinsurance buying process 
the probable maximum loss is model generated and subject to assumptions that may not be reflective of losses incurred for a terrorist act 
the company also seeks to mitigate this exposure through the use of reinsurance 
due to the uncertainty and magnitude of terrorist acts  the company s reinsurance protection may be exceeded and have a material effect on the company s results of operation and financial position 
additionally  the company has evaluated certain high risk locations and hazardous operations where there is a potential for an explosion or a rapid spread of fire 
from this analysis  the company continues to refine its estimates of the probable maximum loss from such an event and factors this analysis into the underwriting evaluation process and also seeks to mitigate this exposure through various policy terms and conditions where allowed by state statute and through the use of reinsurance  to the extent possible 
the company s current reinsurance arrangements either exclude terrorism coverage or significantly limit the level of coverage that is provided

the federal act requires insurers to offer coverage for terrorism as defined in the federal act to its commercial policyholders  requires insurers to specifically notify the insured of the premium for such coverage and allows the insured except workers compensation policyholders to elect to exclude the coverage from the policy 
tria was scheduled to expire on december  however  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of tria extension  was signed by president bush on december   continuing the federal terrorism backstop coverage through december  the tria extension modifies the terms of tria in a number of significant ways 
most notably  the risk retained by the insurance marketplace has been increased substantially  both in the deductible layer and in the vertical coinsurance layer 
under the act  each insurer s deductible was set at of its previous year s direct earned premium for  at for  and at for the tria extension will increase the deductible to of direct earned premium for and to for since the inception of tria  the insurance marketplace has been responsible for bearing of all losses that exceed the deductible  with the federal government bearing the remaining 
total insured losses including all insurer and government losses are limited to an aggregate total of billion 
the tria extension maintains the insurers coinsurance obligation for  but increases this obligation to in additionally  the tria extension has increased the event trigger from million in to million for and to million for terrorism exclusions are not permitted for workers compensation policies under the new federal act or under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which we operate 
when underwriting existing and new workers compensation business  we are considering the added potential risk of loss due to terrorist activity  and this may lead us to decline to write or to renew certain business 
the federal act also does not apply to acts of domestic terrorism or acts that might otherwise be considered acts of terrorism that are not certified by the secretary of the treasury to be acts of terrorism under the federal act 
we continue to attempt to exclude acts of terrorism not covered under the federal act  subject to state approvals 
however  even when terrorism exclusions are permitted  because our clients may object to a terrorism exclusion in connection with business that we may still desire to write without an exclusion  some or many of our insurance policies may not include a terrorism exclusion 
given the retention limits imposed under the federal act and that some or many of our policies may not include an exclusion for terrorism  future terrorist attacks may result in losses that have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
the company has discontinued underwriting of certain lines of business  however  the company is still obligated to pay losses incurred on these lines which include general liability and medical malpractice policies written in past years 
the lines currently in run off are characterized by long elapsed periods between the occurrence of a claim and any ultimate payment to resolve the claim 
included in run off lines are claims related to asbestos and environmental liabilities arising out of general liability policies primarily written in the s and into the mid s  with a limited number of claims occurring on policies written into the early s

the second section shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years related to those reserves 
the third section shows the original recorded reserves as of the end of successive years adjusted to reflect facts and circumstances later discovered 
the last line  cumulative deficiency or redundancy  compares the adjusted reserves to the reserves as originally established and shows that the reserves as originally recorded were either inadequate or excessive to cover the estimated cost of claims as of the respective year end

the netting of liabilities in excess of ceded balances recoverable resulting from the commutation reduced prior accident years loss by million 
the e s segment had favorable development of million consisting of a million reduction for hurricane losses mainly for property lines  and a million reduction spread across other lines as losses have generally developed favorably 
the public entity segment had million of favorable development related to favorable trends in both the casualty and property lines of business which is net of million of property losses for hurricanes 
the risk management segment had million of favorable development including million of favorable development primarily driven by other liability losses from favorable trends on older accident years  offset by million of unfavorable development in workers compensation 
the unfavorable workers compensation development was driven by million of reduced ceded losses from a reinsurance commutation with trenwick america reinsurance corporation  partially offset by favorable development on involuntary pool losses 
the risk management segment experienced favorable workers compensation development on the through accident years  which was largely offset by adverse development on older accident years 
the select markets segment had  of favorable development resulting from regular and ongoing actuarial analyses 
the run off segment had million of unfavorable development with million due to an increase in unallocated loss adjustment expenses  and million of unfavorable development primarily related to reduced ceded losses resulting from an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts for unpaid ceded losses for certain reinsurance treaties 
net loss development recognized in for prior accident years was million 
the e s segment had unfavorable development of million which was caused by an increase in the other liability line of business due to higher than anticipated claims frequency and severity 
the select markets segment had unfavorable development of million which was caused by the impact of the workers compensation loss reserve discount on prior accident years along with some minor actuarial adjustments 
there was a net million of favorable development on the risk management segment primarily attributable to the  and accident years  this amount is after considering unfavorable development for accident years prior to those years 
beginning in  the risk management segment began re underwriting its book of business to loss sensitive policies and less hazardous insureds  and as the actuarial data and related analyses for this business has matured  management reduced its best estimate of ultimate losses 
amortization of the deferred gain on the adc agreement reduced prior accident year loss expense by million 
loss development recognized in was primarily the result of the company s e s segment strengthening case and incurred but not reported reserves by million for its other liability business for loss years and prior 
additionally  the risk management segment recorded adverse development on one wrap up account in the amount of approximately million and increased the allowance for doubtful accounts for balances due from reinsurers by approximately million 
the run off segment decreased its ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in  thereby recording a corresponding increase to net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and a related expense of million 
adverse development during was primarily the result of strengthening reserves for run off lines by million related to asbestos and environmental claims incurred on policies written primarily from the early s to the mid s 
adverse development during was primarily attributable to reserve strengthening of the workers compensation business within the risk management segment 
adverse loss development recognized in increased due to experience in the workers compensation line of business 
in particular  loss experience in california was worse than anticipated 
the negative effect of a california legal ruling adverse to the industry in began manifesting itself starting in  and continuing through the workers compensation industry in california reported results that worsened with each quarter 
the impact of the legal ruling increased claim costs for california workers compensation accidents which occurred in and thereafter 
this legal ruling was the minnear decision which gave a worker s physician complete control in determining all aspects of a workers compensation leave and return to work  minimizing input from insurers 
the full effect of this legal change was delayed due to the nature of workers compensation injuries and the sometimes subjective nature of the system which administers the settlement of workers claims 
it took many months before injured workers with a claim coming under the new legal doctrine went through the system and for new claims to start being administered in the same fashion 
as a result  loss estimates established by the

upon actuarial review of the changing loss climate  the company increased net workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by million during  of which million related to the accident year  million related to the accident year and million related to the accident year 
the balance was spread over a number of years  dating back to adverse development on these claims continued into  though at a greatly reduced rate

risk factors an investment in the company s common stock involves various risks  including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our other periodic filings with the commission 
investors should carefully consider these risks  along with the other information contained in this report  before making an investment decision regarding our common stock 
there may be additional risks of which the company is currently unaware  or which we currently consider immaterial 
all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and value of our common stock 
our results may fluctuate based on many factors  including cyclical changes in the insurance industry 
the results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
the industry s profitability can be affected significantly by rising levels of claim costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  
table of contents 
index to financial statements volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes  changes in reserves resulting from the claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability develop  including particularly with respect to workers compensation  asbestos and environmental claims  and fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of losses 
the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical 
the demand for property and casualty insurance can vary significantly  generally rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as such activity decreases 
the property and casualty insurance industry and the reinsurance business are also very competitive 
during the late s and into  property and casualty insurance companies generally under priced their products  which resulted in poor underwriting results that were partially offset by investment returns 
interest rates decreased in and underwriting results continued to deteriorate for business written in the late s and into these factors coupled with additional potential losses due to terrorism and lower investment returns caused the industry to increase pricing beginning in the latter half of rate increases continued through and to a lesser extent in  and the industry s underwriting results have improved 
the pricing environment during experienced downward pressure  particularly for larger accounts 
the hurricane activity during the third quarter of may result in higher rates for certain property business while reinsurance costs are expected to increase for property catastrophe reinsurance protection but currently the company is unable to estimate the impact this may have on its financial results  if any 
competition for profitable business in the past has resulted in pressure on pricing and less restrictive terms and conditions  contributing to the cyclical pricing and underwriting results 
these fluctuations in demand and competition and the impact on us of other factors identified above could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
legislation and regulatory changes and increased competition could also adversely impact our results 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry 
these developments could include an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their businesses and new companies attempt to enter the insurance and reinsurance business as a result of better pricing and or terms  the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act of which permits financial services companies  such as banks and brokerage firms  to engage in certain insurance activities  which could result in increased competition from financial services companies  programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage  and changing practices caused by the internet  which have led to greater competition in the insurance business 
these developments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive by increasing the supply of insurance and reinsurance available 
the significant amount of capital in the property and casualty marketplace has  until recently  resulted in the supply of insurance and reinsurance outpacing demand 
the property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by a large number of competing companies and modest market shares for industry participants 
according to am best company  or am best  generally considered to be the leading insurance industry rating and analysis firm  as of december   there were approximately  property and casualty insurance companies operating in the united states 
we and our insurance subsidiaries ranked among the largest property and casualty insurance company organizations in the united states  measured by net premiums written rd  and policyholder s surplus nd 
with respect to admitted assets  we and our insurance subsidiaries ranked rd relative to our industry peers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our principal competitors cannot be easily classified 
our principal lines of business are written by numerous other insurance companies 
competition for any one account may come from very large national firms or smaller regional companies 
for our workers compensation lines  additional competition comes from state workers compensation funds 
property and casualty insurance is a highly competitive business  particularly with respect to excess and surplus lines  commercial lines and workers compensation insurance 
over the past several years  competition has become more intense  due to the efforts of many insurance companies to obtain  maintain and expand market share by offering relatively low premium rates 
competition has grown from established companies and the entry of new competitors into the industry 
as an insurance holding company  we are subject to regulation by certain states 
as an insurance holding company  we are subject to regulation by certain states 
all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding companies such as us and our subsidiaries 
this legislation generally provides that each insurance company in the holding company is required to register with the department of insurance of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the group 
such regulation generally provides that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable 
transfers of assets among such affiliated companies  certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system may be subject to prior notice to  or prior approval by  state regulatory authorities 
if our actual losses from insureds exceed our loss reserves  our financial results would be adversely affected 
we record reserves for specific claims incurred and reported and reserves for claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates of losses for reported claims are established judgmentally on an individual case basis 
such estimates are based on our particular experience with the type of risk involved and our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim 
reserves for reported claims consider our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle the claims  including investigation and defense of the claim  and may be adjusted for differences between costs originally estimated and costs re estimated or incurred 
reserves for incurred but not reported claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims  including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors  using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience 
we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
while management believes that amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate  there can be no assurance that future changes in loss development  favorable or unfavorable  will not occur 
the estimates are periodically reviewed and any changes are reflected in current operations 
our objective is to set reserves that are adequate and represent management s best estimate  that is  the amounts originally recorded as reserves should at least equal the ultimate cost to investigate and settle claims 
however  the process of establishing adequate reserves is inherently uncertain  and the ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the amounts reserved 
the reserving process is particularly imprecise for claims involving asbestos  environmental and other long tailed exposures those exposures for which claims take a long time to develop or for which the amount of claims payments are not known for a long period of time now confronting property and casualty insurers 
we regularly monitor and evaluate loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development to verify reserve adequacy 
any adjustment to reserves is reflected in underwriting results for the accounting period in which the adjustment is made 
we have received asbestos and environmental liability claims arising out of general liability coverage primarily written in the s and into the mid s 
we have established a specialized claims unit that investigates and adjusts asbestos and environmental claims 
beginning in  nearly all standard liability policies contained an express exclusion for asbestos and environmental related claims 
in the third quarter of  we increased our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses by approximately million for certain policies issued in one office subsequent to that did not contain this exclusion 
currently  we are not aware of any additional policies issued after without this exclusion 
through our subsidiary  rockwood  we have exposure to claims for black lung disease 
those diagnosed with black lung disease are eligible to receive workers compensation benefits from various federal and state programs 
these programs are continually being reviewed by the governing bodies and may be revised without notice in such a way as to increase the level of our exposure 
in addition to the previously described general uncertainties encountered in estimating reserves  there are significant additional uncertainties in estimating the amount of our potential losses from asbestos and environmental claims 
reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year development factors due to the uncertainties surrounding these types of claims 
among the uncertainties impacting the estimation of such losses are potentially long waiting periods between exposure and emergence of any bodily injury or property damage  
table of contents 
index to financial statements difficulty in identifying sources of environmental or asbestos contamination  difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and or liability for environmental or asbestos damage  changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws  potential for an environmental or asbestos claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods  long reporting delays from insureds to insurance companies  historical data concerning asbestos and environmental losses  which is more limited than historical information on other types of claims  questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance coverage  and uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure 
management believes that these factors continue to render traditional actuarial methods less effective at estimating reserves for asbestos and environmental losses than reserves on other types of losses 
we currently underwrite environmental and pollution coverages on a limited number of policies and underground storage tanks 
we establish reserves to the extent that  in the judgment of management  the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the company not dissimilar to those results the industry has experienced with regard to asbestos and environmental related claims 
we annually review our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for our run off lines of business  including our asbestos and environmental claims 
the review entails a detailed analysis of our direct and assumed exposure 
we engage a consulting actuary to assist us in determining a best estimate of ultimate losses and our management evaluates that estimate in assessing the adequacy of the run off loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
we completed the analysis during the three months ended september  as a result of this analysis  we increased our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by million 
additionally  we increased our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves by million based on this analysis 
we will continue to monitor industry trends and our own experience in order to determine the adequacy of our environmental and asbestos reserves 
due to the uncertainties discussed above  the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have exposure to unpredictable catastrophes  which can materially and adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  power outages  severe winter weather  fires and by man made events  such as terrorist attacks 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for catastrophes until such event takes place 
therefore  although we actively manage our exposure to catastrophes through our underwriting process and the purchase of reinsurance protection  an especially severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
during the third and fourth quarters of and  several hurricanes made landfall  one of which was one of the most devastating natural disasters in united states history 
we have recorded our best estimate of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses for these events as of december   and continue to evaluate our losses 
for the hurricane activity  we recorded losses and loss adjustment expenses related to these hurricanes  net of reinsurance  of million 
as of december   we recorded losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the hurricane activity  net of reinsurance  of million 
during  we recorded favorable development on the hurricanes of million based on an actuarial review of our claims experience and expected ultimate losses 
additionally  reinstatement premiums related to our property catastrophe reinsurance program were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
due to the nature of the claims  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss estimation process 
due to these significant uncertainties  there can be no assurance that future adverse or favorable loss development will not occur 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are currently attempting to exclude coverage for losses due to terrorist activity in our insurance policies where our underwriters determined that there was a significant risk of loss from terrorism activities and where permitted by state insurance departments 
these policies include high profile locations  public entities and risks located in close proximity to potential terrorist targets 
for a significant portion of the commercial insurance business offered by our insurance subsidiaries  excluding our workers compensation business  state insurance departments must approve the terms of our insurance forms and new exclusions included in those forms 
most states had approved terrorism exclusions for polices on commercial insurance business  other than workers compensation insurance 
terrorism exclusions are not permitted for workers compensation policies under the new federal act or under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which we operate 
when underwriting existing and new workers compensation business  we are considering the added potential risk of loss due to terrorist activity  and this may lead us to decline to write or to renew certain business 
the federal act requires significant retention of terrorism losses by insurers based upon a percentage of earned premium for the prior year on a sliding scale from for  for  and for insurers also pay of losses over these retentions up to a maximum industry total of billion 
the federal act also does not apply to acts of domestic terrorism or acts that might otherwise be considered acts of terrorism that are not certified by the secretary of the treasury to be acts of terrorism under the federal act 
we continue to attempt to exclude acts of terrorism not covered under the federal act  subject to state approvals 
however  even when terrorism exclusions are permitted  because our clients may object to a terrorism exclusion in connection with business that we may still desire to write without an exclusion  some or many of our insurance policies may not include a terrorism exclusion 
given the retention limits imposed under the federal act and that some or many of our policies may not include an exclusion for terrorism  future terrorist attacks may result in losses that have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
we face a risk of non collectibility of reinsurance  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
as is common practice within the insurance industry  we transfer a portion of the risks insured under our policies to other companies through purchasing reinsurance 
this reinsurance is maintained to protect the insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims  unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss and catastrophes 
although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay for losses insured under the policies they issue  reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
a credit exposure exists with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
the collectibility of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers  interpretation of contract language and other factors 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with those reinsurers with strong financial strength ratings from a 
m 
best  standard and poor s  or a combination thereof  although the financial condition of a reinsurer may change based on market conditions 
we perform credit reviews on our reinsurers  focusing on  among other things  financial condition  stability  trends and commitment to the reinsurance business 
we also require assets in trust  letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions 
it has not always been standard business practice to require security for balances due  therefore  certain balances are not collateralized 
a reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face a risk of non availability of reinsurance  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to write business and our results of operations and financial condition 
market conditions beyond our control  such as the amount of capital in the reinsurance market and natural and man made catastrophes  determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase 
we cannot be assured that reinsurance will remain continuously available to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
if we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that are considered sufficient  we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or reduce our insurance writings 
since the events of september   reinsurers have generally included terrorism exclusions or limits in their reinsurance agreements 
although this has not materially affected the business written or our results of operations  future terrorist attacks could lead to claims under insurance policies that have been underwritten by us without terrorism exclusions  
table of contents 
index to financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the hurricane activity in the third quarter of  we believe that reinsurance rates will increase  but are unable to reasonably estimate the level of increase at this time 
because insurance ratings are important to our policyholders  downgrades in our insurance ratings may adversely affect our business 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims  factors more relevant to policyholders than investors 
we believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized  independent rating agencies  particularly am best and standard and poor s  are material to our operations 
am best and standard poor s currently rate our principal insurance subsidiaries 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
the rating scales of am best and s p  are as follows am best a to f superior to in liquidation s p aaa to r extremely strong to regulatory supervision our insurance subsidiaries are rated by am best 
am best s ratings are used by insurance buyers  agents and brokers and other insurance companies as an indicator of financial strength and security  and are not intended to reflect the quality of the rated company for investment purposes 
the am best ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are as follows argonaut insurance is rated as an a excellent rd highest rating out of rating classifications with a negative outlook  colony and rockwood are rated as an a excellent with a stable outlook  and great central is rated as an a excellent th highest rating out of rating classifications with a stable outlook 
am best s ratings are used by insureds  agents and brokers  and other insurance companies as an indicator of financial strength and security 
its ratings are not intended to reflect the quality of the rated company for investment purposes 
am best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis  and ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are therefore subject to change 
in november  standard poor s upgraded its financial strength ratings to a on our insurance subsidiaries  with a stable outlook 
standard poor s also upgraded its counterparty credit rating on argonaut group  inc to bbb  also with a stable outlook 
a significant downgrade in these ratings could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry  make it more difficult for us to market our products and result in a material loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claims paying and financial strength ratings 
these ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and therefore  no assurance can be given that our primary insurance subsidiaries can maintain these ratings 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
because we are heavily regulated by the states in which we do business  we may be limited in the way in which we operate 
the insurance industry is highly regulated and supervised 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of the states in which they are domiciled 
such supervision and regulation is designed to protect our policyholders rather than our stockholders 
such supervision and regulation includes matters relating to authorized lines of business  underwriting standards  financial condition standards  licensing of insurers  investment standards  premium levels  policy provisions  the filing of annual and other financial reports prepared on the basis of statutory accounting principles  the filing and form of actuarial reports  dividends  and a variety of other financial and non financial matters 
our insurance subsidiaries are participants of the statutorily created insolvency guarantee associations in all states where they are admitted licensed carriers 
these associations were formed for the purpose of paying claims of insolvent companies 
we are assessed our pro rata share of such claims based upon our premium writings  subject to a maximum annual assessment per line of insurance 
such costs can generally be recovered through surcharges on future premiums 
we do not believe that assessments on current insolvencies will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as an insurance holding company  we are subject to regulation by certain states 
all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding companies such as us and our subsidiaries 
this legislation generally provides that each insurance company in the holding company is required to register with the department of insurance of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the group

index to financial statements transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable 
transfers of assets among such affiliated companies  certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system may be subject to prior notice to  or prior approval by  state regulatory authorities 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the risk based capital  or rbc  provisions under the insurers model act 
rbc is designed to measure the acceptable amount of capital relative to the inherent specific risks of each insurer 
rbc is calculated annually 
state regulatory authorities use the rbc formula to identify insurance companies that may be undercapitalized and may require further regulatory attention 
the formula prescribes a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company  based on the profile of the individual company 
the ratio of a company s actual policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirements will determine whether any state regulatory action is required 
the rbc for the insurers model act provides four levels of regulatory activity if the rbc ratio yielded by the calculation falls below specified minimums 
at each of four successively lower rbc ratios specified by statute  increasing regulatory remedies become available  some of which are mandatory 
the four levels are company action level event  regulatory action level event  authorized control level event  and mandatory control level event 
as of december   all of our insurance subsidiaries had rbc ratios that exceed specified minimums 
because our investment portfolio is made up of fixed income securities and equities  the fair value of our investment portfolio and our investment income could suffer as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions

in addition  our international business is subject to currency exchange rate risk 
we have an exposure to foreign currency risks in conjunction with the reinsurance agreement with hcc insurance holdings inc and investments in foreign securities 
accounts under the international directors and officers liability quota share program may settle in the following currencies us dollars  british pounds  canadian dollars or euros 
remittances are due within days of quarter end  one quarter in arrears 
due to the extended time frame for settling the accounts plus the fluctuation in currency exchange rates  the potential exists for us to realize gains and or losses related to the exchange rates 
for the year ended december   we have recognized a foreign currency loss of million related to this program 
management is unable at this time to estimate the future gains or losses  if any 
we hold a diversified portfolio of investments in common stocks representing us firms in industries and market segments ranging from small market capitalization stocks to the standard poor s stocks 
the marketable equity securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value  and are subject to the risk of potential loss in market value resulting from adverse changes in prices 
equity price risk is managed primarily through the daily monitoring of funds committed to the various types of securities owned and by limiting the exposure in any one investment or type of investment 
no issuer exclusive of the us government and us governmental agencies of fixed income or equity securities represents more than of shareholders equity as of december  our primary exposure to interest rate risk relates to our fixed maturity investments including redeemable preferred stock  as well as our junior subordinated debentures 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities  redeemable preferred stock and debt service requirements 
some fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this subjects us to reinvestment risk if issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
litigation and legal proceedings against our insurance subsidiaries could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
our insurance subsidiaries have been sued in a number of class action lawsuits and other major litigation as a result of their insurance operations 
our insurance companies have responded to the lawsuits and believe that there are meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest these claims 
the plaintiffs in certain of these lawsuits have not quantified the amounts they ultimately will seek to recover 
in addition  in the case of class actions  it is uncertain whether a class will be certified  the number of persons included in any class  and the amount of damages that are ultimately sought by the class members 
as a result  we are unable  with any degree of certainty  to determine a range of any potential loss  or whether such an outcome is probable or remote 
however  adverse judgments in one or more of such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results
