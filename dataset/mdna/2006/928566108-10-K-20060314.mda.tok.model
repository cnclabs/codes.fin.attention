except for the historical information contained herein  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in risk factors part  item a  as well as those discussed elsewhere 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
the cautionary statements made herein should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear herein 
business overview we are a leading provider of medical devices for the minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux disease  a progressive condition caused by incompetent vein valves in the legs 
we also provide devices for use in the minimally invasive treatment of other peripheral vascular diseases  including devices for use in peripheral arterial bypass and arteriovenous graft procedures 
venous reflux disease results in symptoms such as leg pain  swelling  fatigue  skin ulcers and painful varicose veins 
our primary product line  the closure system  consists of a proprietary rf generator and proprietary disposable endovenous catheters and devices to close diseased veins through the application of temperature controlled rf energy 
we estimate that in excess of  patients have been treated using our closure system since in january  we began a limited introduction of our closurerfs tm family of products  which can be used for perforator vein ablation 
since our inception in january  we have focused on the development of minimally invasive treatments for venous reflux disease 
until  our operations consisted primarily of start up activities  including the development of our closure system  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
we launched commercial sales of our closure system in europe in late and in the united states in late 
table of contents for the year ended december   we generated net revenues of million and net income of million 
as of december   we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
from inception to september  we were not profitable 
we were profitable beginning in the last quarter of and have been profitable in each of the eight quarters since 
we are planning to make significant investments in our operations during and are projecting a net loss for that year 
we market our closure system through a direct sales organization in the united states and a subsidiary in germany 
we also market and sell our products through distributors throughout the world 
most of our us customers are reimbursed by governmental and third party payors  and that reimbursement is subject to periodic review and adjustment 
currently  our closure procedure is covered by the policies of approximately health insurers  representing over million covered lives in the united states 
our net revenues are derived from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessory products  which comprised  and of our net revenues  respectively  in we expect that any shift in the percentage of net revenues derived from the sales of disposable catheters and rf generators during will be modest 
we manufacture  package and label our disposable endovenous catheters and devices and outsource the manufacture of our rf generators and accessory packs 
we have a diverse customer base of hospitals  physicians and physician groups  with no customer accounting for or more of our net revenues or accounts receivable in the years ended december   and financial operations overview net revenues 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and rf generators 
our large installed base of rf generators facilitates a recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable catheters 
in addition  we derive a small portion of our revenues from the sale of accessory products 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues represents the cost of materials  overhead  direct labor and delivery charges associated with the manufacture of disposable catheters  the purchase and delivery of rf generators  the purchase and delivery of accessory products  depreciation and amortization of stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing personnel compensation  sales force incentive compensation  travel  promotional materials  advertising  patient education materials  other expenses incurred to provide reimbursement services and clinical training and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product development  expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and amortization of related deferred stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for accounting  human resources  information technology and corporate administration  legal fees  accounting fees  facilities expenses and amortization of related deferred stock based compensation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results 
table of contents may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
in order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our domestic and international return policy allows customers to return unused products for a period of and days  respectively  subject to restocking fees 
we make provisions for estimated returns and allowances based on historical levels 
to date  returns and allowances have been insignificant 
if actual returns and allowances were to deviate significantly from our estimates  our revenues could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based upon historical demand and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the current cost of the inventory and estimated market value and is charged to the provision for inventory obsolescence  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
at the point of recognition of the loss  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology  we could be required to increase our inventory allowance and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
historically  we have not had a significant incidence of inventory obsolescence 
warranty costs 
at the time we recognize revenues  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expense associated with revenues  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
we offer a one year limited warranty on our rf generator which is included in the sales price of the generator 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the number of units sold  historical and anticipated cost per claim and rates of warranty claims 
we primarily estimate material costs based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
our service agreement with our rf generator manufacturer provides us with a warranty on the generators for the shorter of months from the date of shipment to us or months from the date of first use 
as such  our warranty expense is only required to cover those expenses not covered by our service agreement 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if costs of servicing warranty claims are greater than the expectations on which the accrual has been based  our gross profit could be adversely affected 
historically  our warranty claims have been immaterial 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance based on the aging of account balances  collection history  credit quality of the customer and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we generally maintain a diverse customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 

table of contents additionally  if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses and gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax bases of an asset or a liability and its reported amount on the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates due to the impact of net operating loss carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes and the tax impact of non us operations 
because we have had a history of net losses from inception through the year ended december   and because we are projecting a net loss in  recovery of our deferred tax assets is in doubt and we have established a valuation allowance against the entire balance of our deferred tax assets 
if we are able to demonstrate consistent profitability in the future  and we are able to establish that recovery is more likely than not  we would reduce our valuation allowance at a future date 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities  however  we are not currently under audit by any taxing jurisdiction 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 
and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation cost is recognized based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment 
in the fourth quarter of  we began awarding restricted stock units as well as stock options to employees 
we award a limited number of stock options and warrants to non employees 
we account for non cash stock based expense from options and warrants issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force pronouncement no 
 accounting for equity investments that are issued to non employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
for these options and warrants  we recognize the non cash stock based expense over the service period of the underlying awards  based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
all unvested options issued to non employees are marked to market until such options vest 

table of contents we amortize stock based compensation relating to stock option awards on the accelerated vesting method over the vesting periods of the stock options  which is generally four years 
the accelerated vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in accelerated vesting as compared to the straight line method 
we amortize stock based compensation relating to restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the restricted stock units 
from january  through december   we recorded unearned stock based compensation of million 
employee stock based compensation amortized to expense during the three year period was million 
at december   we had a total of million remaining to be amortized over the vesting periods of the stock options and restricted stock units 
we have evaluated financial accounting standards board statement no 
r sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which require companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r and sab no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net earnings per share 
we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
we also expect to apply the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year based on the closing price of our common stock on december  of per share  the intrinsic value of the options and restricted stock units outstanding at december  was million  of which million was vested and million was unvested

in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations

we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net earnings per share 
we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees 
upon adoption of sfas r  we expect to apply the modified prospective transition method  except for those options that were measured using the minimum value method under fas  for which we expect to apply the prospective transition method 
upon adoption  all stock based compensation will be amortized on a straight line basis

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to apply voluntary changes in accounting principles on 
table of contents a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
accordingly  companies must apply the new accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas no 
s retrospective application requirement replaces apb s requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  and will only impact the financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle is made 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf statement  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
the task force reached a consensus that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or that are placed in service significantly after  and not contemplated at or near the beginning of  the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
eitf applies to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations for and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations for in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires that rental costs associated with operating leases be allocated on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  starting with the beginning of the lease term 
fsp provides additional guidance regarding how a lessee should determine the beginning of the lease term 
fsp requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense in operating income  if the lessee has the right to control the use of the leased asset during and after the construction period 
the guidance in fsp is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as percentages of revenues  for the years ended december    and years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues derived from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessories for the years ended december   and years ended december  catheters rf generators accessories the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues from domestic and international sales for the years ended december    and years ended december  united states europe other international net revenues 
net revenues increased  or million  to million in from million in net revenues increased  or million  to million in  from million in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the number of disposable catheters and rf generators sold as a result of our increased direct selling and marketing efforts in the united states  as well as the limited launch of the closurerfs tm family of products and additional single use accessories 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average us selling price of disposable catheters and an decline in the average selling price of us rf generators 
the increase in was also due to an increase in the number of disposable catheters and rf generators sold as a result of our increased direct selling and marketing efforts in the united states 
however  these increases were not significantly offset by discounts 
table of contents in average selling price 
we expect net revenues to continue to increase in  though at a more modest rate 
we also expect modest price discounting to continue due to competitive pressures 
our product revenue mix in was comparable to  and we expect the mix to be approximately the same in international sales accounted for of net revenues in  the same as in and we expect that the percent of net revenues from international sales will remain at approximately of net revenues in gross profit 
cost of revenues increased  or million  to million in  from million in cost of revenues increased  or million  to million in  from million in the increases in and were primarily due to the increased number of disposable catheters and rf generators sold  partially offset by lower direct material  labor and overhead costs per unit in the production of disposable catheters 
gross profit in was million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in and million  or of net revenues in the increases in gross profit margin percentage in and were primarily due to the allocation of manufacturing overhead over a greater number of units produced  as well as reduced direct costs of production per unit of our disposable catheters 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in average selling prices of our disposable catheters and rf generators 
we expect prices of our disposable catheters to continue to decline in however  we do not expect an offsetting decline in cost due to higher fixed manufacturing overhead related to the new facility and increased compensation cost due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
increased catheter production volume is expected to absorb some portion of the higher overhead expense 
as a result  we expect that our gross margin percentage in will be less than our gross margin percentage in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million in  from million in sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million in  from million in the increase in was primarily the result of increased payroll and related expenses of million incurred related to a increase in sales and marketing personnel as well as a  increase in product promotion and advertising expenses 
the increase in was primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses of million as compared to incurred in connection with the addition of employees to our marketing and direct sales organization  increased amortization of deferred stock compensation expenses of  and increased product promotion and advertising expenses of  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in as we continue to invest in marketing programs and begin expensing stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased  or  to million in  from million in research and development expenses increased  or million  to million in  from million in the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in project related expenses of  as well as  in research and development expenses that were charged to product cost to support improvements in the manufacturability of existing products 
the increase in of million was primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses of  and clinical study expenses of  in support of our new rfg generator product development 
the new generator began shipping in november we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we continue to invest in the development of new products and consequently  the need to conduct new clinical studies 
expenses will also increase due to expensing of stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in  from million in general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million  from million in the increase in was primarily due to consulting and accounting fees related to compliance with regulations applicable to public companies  including section of the sarbanes oxley act of  in the amount of million  increased personnel expenses of million  increased insurance expenses of  as well as  in bank fees and  in bad debt expense 
also   was incurred in legal fees to pursue patent infringement litigation 
the increase in was primarily due to increased professional fees of million  increased personnel expenses of  increased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  as well as an increase in 
table of contents insurance expenses and state and local taxes 
these increases were driven primarily by the costs of becoming  and operating as  a public company 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase at a more modest rate in primarily due to continued patent litigation expenses 
expenses will also increase due to expensing of stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  increased  or million  to million in  from  in interest income and other  net  increased  or  to  in  from  in the increase in was primarily due to increased average cash and short term investment balances in and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates earned on our interest bearing accounts 
the increase in was also primarily due to increased average cash balances in and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates earned on our interest bearing accounts 
we expect interest income and other to increase slightly in primarily due to higher interest rates earned on our interest bearing accounts 
provision for income taxes 
we have significant net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards 
the  provision for income taxes in represents the estimated state income taxes payable  reduced for the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards 
in  we recorded  in income tax provision 
we recorded no provision for income taxes in due to net operating losses 
we expect to use nol and other tax carryforward amounts to the extent taxable income is earned in and beyond 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million and state nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol carryforwards expire in various periods through and the state nol carryforwards expire in various periods through we have federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and million  respectively 
the federal research credits expire in various periods through and the state research credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
the amounts of and the benefits from nol and credit carryforwards may be impaired in some circumstances 
events that may cause such limitations include  but are not limited to  sale of equity securities and other changes in ownership 
we have historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes 
additionally  we are projecting a net loss in therefore  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nol and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at december  we will retain a full valuation allowance until such time that we determine it is more likely than not that we will recognize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
prior to the release of the valuation allowance  to the extent that we are profitable  our effective tax rate should continue to be substantially less than the applicable statutory rates 
following the release of our valuation allowance  our effective tax rate will approximate the applicable statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities we incurred net losses from inception through september  of million and have been profitable in each subsequent quarter 
we are projecting a net loss in we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in several large money market funds consisting of debt instruments of the us government  its agencies and high quality corporate issuers with original maturities of less than three months 
investments designated as short term consist of cash invested in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of 
table of contents convertible preferred stock and common stock  and cash generated from operations 
in addition  we raised approximately million  net of issuance costs  from our initial public offering of common stock in october net cash provided from operating activities was million in cash provided from operating activities in was attributable primarily to net income after adjustments for non cash depreciation and amortization charges  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and other long term assets 
the increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable were driven by a increase in revenue  to million in from million in the increase in prepaid and other expenses primarily reflects an increase in interest receivable on short term investments 
we did not have any short term investments in the increase in other long term assets reflects the deposit made on our new facility which we expect to occupy in march under the terms of our new lease  the landlord has agreed to provide an allowance for the planning and construction of tenant improvements in the amount of approximately million 
the leasehold improvements made with the allowance will be recorded as deferred rent  which will be reflected as cash provided by operating activities due to an increase in other liabilities in an offsetting amount will be recorded as leasehold improvements 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in cash provided from operating activities in was attributable primarily to net income after adjustments for non cash depreciation and amortization charges  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increases in accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were driven by a increase in revenue  to million in from million in net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended cash used in operating activities in was attributable primarily to net losses after adjustment for non cash depreciation and amortization charges and increases in accounts receivable associated with higher revenues  partially offset by increased accounts payable balances 
inventory balances increased  in from primarily to accommodate the increased demand for our disposable catheters 
net cash used in investing activities was million   and  for the years ended  and  respectively 
for  cash used in investing activities primarily reflects purchases of short term investments  and to a much lesser degree  purchases of property and equipment primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and facility improvements 
for and  cash used in investing activities primarily reflects purchases of property and equipment primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and facility improvements 
under the terms of our new lease  the landlord has agreed to provide an allowance for the planning and construction of tenant improvements in the amount of approximately million 
the leasehold improvements made with the allowance will be recorded as leasehold improvements upon being placed into service  which will be reflected as a use of cash in investing activities in an offsetting amount will be recorded as deferred rent 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and  in the amount reflects proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options 
the amount primarily reflects proceeds received upon our initial public offering in october and the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in the amounts in reflect proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options 
we expect that marketing  research and general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in connection with the growth of our business and our operations as a public company  including consulting expenses associated with compliance with sfas no 
r and patent litigation 
we also expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to our new corporate headquarters 
we expect to fund these increased costs and expenditures from our cash flows from operations and our existing cash balance 
however  our future capital requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  patent litigation  the costs of obtaining and maintaining food and drug 
table of contents administration and other regulatory clearances of our products and products in development  the effects of competing technological and market developments  the costs associated with being a public company  including consulting expenses associated with compliance with sfas no 
r and section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and cash we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may require additional funds in order to further develop the marketplace  complete clinical studies and deliver new products to our customers 
we may seek financing of future cash needs through the sale of equity securities and debt 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our business operations or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity or debt securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations and capital expenditure less than more than requirements total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations inventory purchase commitments leasehold improvements total item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  substantially all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
approximately of total sales have been denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  we believe that there is currently no material exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers via several large money market funds 
the funds maintain an average investment maturity of days or less 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is currently no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
