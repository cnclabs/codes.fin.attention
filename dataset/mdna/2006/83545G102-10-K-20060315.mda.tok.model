item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
the financial and statistical data contained in the following discussion for all periods presented reflects our december  classification of franchises between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
and the restatement of certain cash flows related to notes payable floor plan see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of march  we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  manufacturer warranty repairs  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended service contracts  financing  insurance and other aftermarket products for our customers 
in addition  although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not as dependent upon near term sales volume 
as a result  we believe the diversity of these products and services reduces the risk of periodic economic downturns 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold increased by to million vehicles in from million vehicles in this was the second consecutive annual increase in industry sales 
many factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s total amount of new vehicles sold 
in  our import stores outperformed the industry s import unit sales growth and our domestic stores outperformed the industry s domestic sales contraction of 
we sell similar products and services that exhibit similar economic characteristics  use similar processes in selling our products and services and sell our products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result of this and the way we manage our business  we have aggregated our operating segments into a single segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business we evaluate our dealership franchises for possible disposition based on various performance criteria 
during the year ended december   we sold franchises  terminated two franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
these franchises have been identified as held for sale because of unprofitable operations or other strategic considerations 
we believe the disposition of these franchises will allow us to focus our management attention on those remaining stores with the highest potential return on investment 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
table of contents amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance  insurance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or extended service contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by million 
our estimate of chargebacks million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay off 
if these factors change  the resulting impact is a change in our estimate for chargebacks 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
based on criteria established by the applicable accounting pronouncements  we allocate the carrying value of goodwill and test it for impairment based on our three geographic divisions 
the  million of goodwill on our balance sheet  including approximately million classified in assets held for sale  at december  was allocated to the following geographic divisions dollars in millions eastern division central division western division in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of each division to the fair value of the underlying dealerships in each division 
this represents the first step of the impairment test 
if the fair value of a division is less than the carrying value of that division  we are then required to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the assets of the respective division as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price of the business combination 
this allocation would include assigning value to any previously unrecognized identifiable assets including franchise assets which means the remaining fair value that would be allocated to goodwill would be significantly reduced 
see discussion regarding franchise agreements acquired prior to july  in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we would then compare the fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation process to the carrying value of the goodwill in the respective division with the difference representing the amount of impairment 

table of contents we use several assumptions and various fair value approaches in estimating the fair value of each division 
these assumptions and approaches include an earnings multiple for private dealership valuations as determined by the historical multiple paid for dealerships we have purchased applied to actual earnings  an earnings multiple for public consolidators in our peer group applied to actual earnings  and a discounted cash flow utilizing estimated future earnings and our weighted average cost of capital 
these approaches are blended to arrive at a fair value of each division 
at december  the date of our latest impairment test  the fair value of each of our divisions exceeded the carrying value of that division step one of the above described impairment test 
as a result  we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above  and we recognized no impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill on our balance sheet at december  however  if in future periods we determine that the fair value of one or more of our divisions is less than their carrying value  we believe that application of the second step of the impairment test would result in a substantial impairment charge to the goodwill allocated to such division s and the amount of such impairment charge would likely be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results and financial position 
insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
we accrue for insurance reserves on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in certain cases  a discount factor 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
we used an experience modification factor in estimating reserves for workers compensation claims of 
a change of five basis points in this factor would have changed the reserve by million 
we used a discount rate of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims 
a change of basis points in the discount rate would have changed the workers compensation reserve by million 
a discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of our general liability claim reserves 
a change of basis points in the discount rate would have changed the general liability reserve by million 
legal proceedings we are involved  and will continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
during  we recorded an additional million in legal reserves 
as of december   we had million in legal reserves included in other accrued liabilities 
currently  with the exception of the tada and galura litigation matters discussed in item legal proceedings herein  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve us that  in the opinion of management  could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations cash flows and prospects 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results from operations of our continuing and discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income based on the provisions of sfas no 
many of these provisions involve judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported as continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if in 
table of contents future periods we determine that a franchise should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  previously reported consolidated statements of income may be reclassified in order to reflect the current classification 
income taxes as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we believe that our tax positions comply  in all material respects  with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
included in other accrued liabilities at december  is million in reserves that we have provided for these matters 
we have million in deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and management reviews these carryforward positions  the time remaining until expiration and other opportunities to utilize these carryforwards in making an assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will be utilized 
based on our judgment  we have not recorded a valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that taxable income for these states will be sufficient to realize the benefits of the associated deferred tax assets 
however  the results of future operations  regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  actual utilization of the losses which created these deferred tax assets which differs from the assumptions used in the development of our judgment could result in a charge that would be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we accrue for income taxes on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration estimated income taxes based on prior year income tax returns  changes in income tax law  our income tax strategies and other factors 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
cornerstone acceptance allowance for credit losses as of december   we had outstanding notes receivable arising from operations of our wholly owned finance subsidiary  cornerstone acceptance corporation cornerstone  of million  net of an allowance for credit losses of million 
these notes receivable have average terms of approximately forty two months and are secured by the related vehicles 
our assessment of allowance for credit losses considers historical loss ratios  the performance of the current portfolio with respect to past due accounts  and the average age of the accounts in the current portfolio 
as of december   the average loss ratio for mature accounts was and the average percentage of losses remaining to be incurred on the current portfolio as a result of the average age of the current portfolio was 
a change of basis points in both of these percentages would have changed our estimated allowance for credit losses by million at december  these notes receivable are recorded in other current assets and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and is effective for us on january  sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
tax benefits associated with share based payments will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital 
cash retained as a result of these tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows and operating cash outflows 
on december   a committee of our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all outstanding options to purchase our class a common stock with an exercise price of more than per share 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting of these stock options is to reduce the non cash 
table of contents compensation expense we would have recorded in future periods pursuant to sfas no 
r 
this accelerated vesting reduced future expense pursuant to sfas no 
r by approximately million 
we believe that  because the stock options being accelerated have exercise prices in excess of the market price of our class a common stock on the day of acceleration  the stock options have limited economic value at this time 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will increase compensation expense by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  as a result of expensing the fair value of unvested options as of the date of adoption over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value of the option at the grant date 
this estimate does not include any expense related to stock options that may be granted subsequent to december  results of operations the following table summarizes the percentages of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance  insurance and other total revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  floor plan interest expense  other  net other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

the cost of sales line item includes the cost of new and used vehicles  vehicle parts and all costs directly linked to servicing customer vehicles 
during the year ended december   we sold franchises  terminated two franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in addition to these dispositions  during the years ended december  and  we disposed of seven and franchises  respectively 

table of contents annual same store results of operations represent the aggregate of the same store results for each of the four quarters in that year 
same store results for each quarter include dealerships that were owned and operated for the entire quarter in both periods and were classified as continuing operations under sfas no 
at december  unless otherwise noted  our discussion of the results of operations from new vehicles to gross profit and gross margins is on a same store basis 
new vehicles new vehicle revenues include the sale and lease of new vehicles  as well as the sale of fleet vehicles 
new vehicle revenues are highly dependent on manufacturer incentives  which vary from cash back incentives to low interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers for adequate vehicle allocations to meet customer demands 
the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse mix of domestic and import branded dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
we believe that this diversity reduces the risk of changes in customer preferences  product supply shortages and aging products 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by import and luxury dealerships compared to for we expect this trend toward more import and domestic luxury dealerships to continue 
we believe demographic and other trends favor import and luxury brands and expect our acquisition activity in the future to concentrate primarily  but not completely  on these brands 
we expect that industry wide new vehicle sales will continue their overall long term trend of growing modestly faster than population growth after considering the impact of normal business cycles 
we also believe the trend toward ownership of more vehicles per household will continue

our top performing import brands for were honda  bmw and lexus  which posted increases of  units  or  units  or  and  units  or  respectively 
these increases can be attributed to the introduction of new models  in addition to new body styling and design on existing models 
in addition  management stability at our honda dealerships contributed to the improvement in new vehicle sales volume 
our volvo dealerships experienced the most significant decline in sales volume among our import stores  decreasing by units  or  as compared to the results at our volvo dealerships are consistent with overall market share declines experienced by volvo in the industry as a whole 
the majority of the domestic dealership declines were from our cadillac dealerships down units  or  which was mainly the result of declining suv sales 
our gm excluding cadillac and ford dealerships experienced considerable declines in new retail unit volume  but strong fleet sales 
table of contents led to slight overall improvements in total new unit sales volume 
our domestic dealerships continued to experience market share declines and continued to show a decline in sales volume during the current year 
we believe that this trend is consistent with the industry as a whole 
in total  our sales price per unit increased by  or  during this can be mainly attributed to the fact that a larger percentage of our sales are being generated by higher priced luxury vehicles 
many of our import dealerships experienced price per unit increases  most notably being honda  bmw and lexus up  and  respectively 
our gm and cadillac dealerships experienced the most significant decreases in sales price per unit down and  respectively 
the decreases at these dealerships can be attributed to both the various pricing strategies put in place by gm during and a shift from truck and suv sales to car sales during the year 
during  both our import and domestic dealerships experienced significant decreases in total same store new vehicle unit sales  as compared to our import dealerships experienced decreases of  units  or  during this time period 
this is compared to an industry increase in unit sales at import dealerships generally of 
despite the overall sales volume decrease at our import dealerships  our bmw stores experienced a unit volume increase of 
this increase can be primarily attributed to the introduction of new models and new body styles for existing models 
our domestic dealerships experienced unit sales declines of  units  or  during this was compared to an industry decrease in unit sales at domestic dealerships of 
our ford dealerships were responsible for a majority of the domestic decline due primarily to ford s continued loss of market share to import brands 
our cadillac and chrysler dealerships were responsible for the remainder of our domestic decline  experiencing decreases of units  or  and units  or  respectively 
all of our dealerships except honda  toyota and volvo experienced sales price per unit increases during our honda and toyota dealerships experienced only slight decreases  while our volvo stores posted a considerable price per unit decrease of  or  when compared to our bmw  nissan and hyundai dealerships experienced the most significant price increases due to a higher volume of truck and suv sales 
used vehicles used vehicle revenues are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
in addition  various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to certify pre owned vehicles based on criteria established by the manufacturer 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty 
we believe the used vehicle business will become more clearly segmented and cpo vehicles and similar products will continue to grow as a larger share of dealership used vehicle sales 
on a continuing operations basis  our sales of cpo vehicles increased to  units in of total units from  units in of total units  an increase of

of our import stores  honda and bmw posted the most significant increases in used unit volume  improving by  units  or  and units  or 
cadillac was the largest contributor to the domestic decline in unit volume  decreasing by units  or  as compared to our unit price increase can be mainly attributed to an increase in cpo vehicles sold as a percentage of total used units sold increasing from in to in 
during  we experienced challenges in the used vehicle market due to manufacturer incentives on new vehicles 
the decreases in used units sold occurred primarily in our domestic dealerships  which decreased by  units  or  as compared to our florida  ohio  dallas and oklahoma markets combined represented of the total unit decline in only one market  alabama tennessee  which has a high concentration of import and or luxury brands  reported an improvement in unit volume  increasing by units  or 
wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume

for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total wholesale vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale unit price same store total dealerships as reported higher revenues realized in were driven by higher unit sales prices for both our domestic and import dealerships  which increased and  respectively 
the pricing increases at our import dealerships were consistent with the changes experienced in used retail sales volume for those dealerships 
our import dealerships posted unit volume increases of  units  or  while our domestic dealerships experienced decreases of units  or  as compared to improvements in retail vehicle sales volume  the principal source of wholesale vehicle revenues via trade in  contributed to the higher volume in the current year 
during  higher revenues realized were driven by higher unit sales prices for both our domestic and import dealerships  which increased and  respectively 
favorable pricing increases followed the increases experienced in used retail sales and were consistent with the industry 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in domestic dealership unit volume 
lower overall retail vehicle sales volume contributed to the decline in wholesale unit volume experienced during 
table of contents parts  service and collision repair fixed operations parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
same store revenue from these items was as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended change change for the year ended change change parts service collision repair parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  vehicle quality and manufacturer warranty programs 
during  of our service and parts revenue was generated by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs compared to by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs in we believe that over time  vehicle quality will improve  but vehicle complexity will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe that we have the ability  through our access to capital  to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
in addition  manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on cpo vehicles see the discussion in business business strategy certified pre owned vehicles above  should allow continued growth in our service and parts business 
parts revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs as prices for warranty parts are established by the manufacturer 
we believe that long term trends in retail parts sales will be affected by the same trends as discussed above for service additional capacity  customer satisfaction  etc one of the key metrics we use to analyze the profitability of our fixed operations business is fixed absorption 
this metric represents the percentage of a dealership s fixed costs which are covered by the operating profit of fixed operations 
our fixed absorption rate was in compared to in we believe that we substantially exceed the industry s average fixed absorption rate  due primarily to our emphasis on luxury brands 
as of december   we operated collision repair centers 
collision revenues are heavily impacted by trends in the automotive insurance industry 
over the last few years  collision repair revenues have either declined or remained flat because customers are choosing higher deductible policies  thus choosing not to make minor repairs that were previously covered by lower deductible policies 
in addition  when insurance companies declare a vehicle totaled  the model year of that vehicle often determines where it is repaired 
late model vehicles tend to be repaired at franchised dealership body shops  while older vehicles tend to be repaired at stand alone collision centers

our bmw dealerships experienced significant increases in fixed operations revenues  increasing by million  or  compared to as a continued result of bmw s vehicle maintenance programs and strong same store new vehicle sales 
in addition  our bmw stores posted increases in warranty sales of million  or 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases in warranty sales at our domestic dealerships  which declined million  or  compared to the overall domestic dealership fixed operations revenue declines primarily relate to our gm and cadillac dealerships  which decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  as compared to the declines in our gm dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in wholesale parts sales of million  or 
the wholesale parts declines experienced by our gm dealerships can be primarily attributed to the closure of one of our large wholesale parts operations during in addition  consistent with unit declines in new vehicles of  warranty sales at our cadillac stores experienced declines of million  or  as compared to overall  same store collision revenues were relatively flat when compared to same store fixed operations revenues increased slightly during  primarily due to the strong performance of our import dealerships up million  or

the increase in warranty sales experienced by our import dealerships were partially offset by our domestic dealerships  which posted decreases of million  or  compared to the overall domestic dealership revenue decline of million  or  primarily relates to our ford dealerships  which decreased million  or 
the declines in our ford dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in wholesale parts sales of million  or 
our ford wholesale parts revenues continued to decrease during as competition increased and the scale of those operations had declined 
same store collision revenues were relatively flat when compared to finance  insurance and other finance  insurance and other revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance  sales of third party extended service contracts for vehicles and other aftermarket products 
in connection with vehicle financing  service contracts  other aftermarket products and insurance contracts  we receive a commission from the provider for originating the contract 
finance  insurance and other revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our penetration rate 
the penetration rate represents the percentage of vehicle sales on which we are able to originate financing or sell extended service contracts  other aftermarket products or insurance contracts 
our finance penetration rate decreased to in from in our extended service contract penetration rate increased to in from in we expect our finance and insurance penetration rate to increase over time as we continue to emphasize the sale of extended service contracts and other products

our honda  bmw and lexus dealerships led the improvement with revenue increases of million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  as compared to our domestic dealerships posted a decline in finance  insurance and other revenues of million  or  which can be attributed to lower retail unit sales and price per unit decreases on both new and used vehicles 
our gm and cadillac dealerships alone represented million of the domestic revenue decrease 
in addition  our ford stores posted finance  insurance and other revenue declines of million  or  due to decreases in both the number of new retail units and used units sold 
both the gm and cadillac revenue declines were attributable to decreases in both the number of retail units sold and the average price per unit sold

our honda and toyota dealerships led the decline with decreases of million  or  and million  or  respectively

gross profit and gross margins the cost of sales line item includes the cost of new and used vehicles  vehicle parts and all costs directly linked to servicing customer vehicles labor for parts  service and collision repair associates  depreciation on service equipment and service consumables 
our overall gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin rate of any product or service we offer 
as a result  sales of new vehicles comprise a relatively small portion of total gross profits when compared to revenue 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin rate than new vehicles 
parts  service and collision repair carry a higher gross margin rate than retail used sales 
product mix also has an impact on the gross margins that we realize 
historically  our import and luxury brands provide higher margins than our domestic brands 
as we continue to acquire more import and luxury dealerships  we would expect our gross margins to increase 
our same store revenue mix between different products is shown in the following table for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change revenues as a percentage of total revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles fixed operations finance  insurance and other total as reported for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported 
table of contents the overall gross margin rates on our various revenue lines on a same store basis were as follows for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance overall gross margin our overall gross margin percentage declined in due to a higher percentage of our total revenues being generated by new vehicle sales and a decrease in the new vehicle gross margin rate offsetting improvements experienced in all other categories 
the most significant gross margin percentage increase related to our fixed operations activities  which can be primarily attributed to both an overall decrease in wholesale parts revenue  which generate low margins  and an increase in service revenue  especially at our higher margin luxury dealerships 
in addition  some of our domestic dealerships contributed to the fixed operations increase 
our gm excluding cadillac and ford dealerships experienced fixed operations margin increases of basis points and basis points  respectively 
the overall same store gross margin percentage remained flat at in and  primarily due to lower finance  insurance and other revenues resulting from lower overall units retailed 
as finance  insurance and other activities contribute gross margin  fluctuations in these revenues can have a significant impact on the overall gross margin percentage 
improvements experienced in all other categories were offset by the effect of finance  insurance and other activities 
the largest increases in margin percentages relate to used and wholesale vehicles  which were primarily attributed to price increases driven by a lower supply of higher quality used vehicles than in previous years 
fixed operations gross margin percentages improved primarily due to increases experienced at our high volume import dealerships  including honda and bmw 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expense  advertising expense  rent and rent related expense  and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission which typically vary depending on gross profits realized and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary 
due to the salary component of certain dealership personnel s compensation  gross profits and compensation expense are not correlated 
advertising expense and other expense vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically vary with the number of dealerships owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates 
although not completely correlated  we believe the best way to measure sg a expenses is as a percentage of gross profit 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total sg a in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported as a percentage of gross profit  sg a expenses improved  decreasing from in to in acquisitions contributed million to the year over year dollar increase 
total compensation expense increased million in compared to of this increase  million was due to acquisitions

in  as a percentage of gross profit  total sg a decreased to from in total compensation increased in compared to  while decreasing as a percentage of gross profit from in to in advertising expenses increased million year over year 
of this increase  million was due to acquisitions 
the increase in advertising expense can be attributed to a targeted approach to allocating advertising dollars to certain brands in key markets in despite this increase  the advertising expense to gross profit ratio was mostly flat compared to advertising expenses decreased million in compared to this was due to a process implemented in early which allocated advertising expenditures centrally and more closely controlled spending 
rent and rent related expenses increased million in compared to as a percentage of gross profit  rent and rent related expenses increased to in from in facility improvements projects on existing facilities contributed million to the increase  acquisitions contributed million and  in addition  our variable rate leases experienced increases in rent expense 
rent and rent related expenses increased million in compared to this was completely due to acquisitions  new facilities and improvements on existing facilities  as rent and rent related expenses at same store dealerships declined million

liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving facility and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service 
table of contents debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash based on their ability to generate cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with the ultimate resolution of geopolitical conflicts may therefore affect our overall liquidity 
a significant portion of our cash flow is used to fund dealership acquisitions 
following is a summary of acquisition activity in recent years which are stated net of floor plan advances and cash acquired in millions acquisitions subsequent year revenues cash portion of purchase price a a revenues are estimated prior to  we had maintained a long term debt to total capital ratio of approximately to depending on the timing of our dealership acquisitions

at december  our long term debt to total capital ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 
our long term debt structure consists of the revolving facility due in and various senior subordinated notes due or redeemable in   and these are discussed in more detail below

acquisitions and dispositions during  we acquired five franchises for a combined purchase price of million in cash 
the cash utilized for these acquisitions was financed by notes payable floor plan borrowings of million  cash generated from our existing operations and by borrowings under our revolving facility 
during  we disposed of or terminated franchises 
these disposals generated cash of million 

table of contents in january  we purchased two franchises and a collision repair center for million including goodwill  franchise assets and operating assets net of notes payable floor plan advances and operating liabilities 
sale leaseback transactions in an effort to generate additional cash flow  we typically seek to structure our operations to minimize the ownership of real property 
as a result  facilities either constructed by us or obtained in acquisitions are typically sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions 
the resulting leases generally have initial terms of years and include a series of five year renewal options 
we have no continuing obligations under these arrangements other than lease payments 
the majority of our sale leaseback transactions are completed with cars 
in  we sold million in dealership property and equipment in sale leaseback transactions 
there were no material gains or losses on these sales 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our dealerships 
capital expenditures in were approximately million  of which approximately million related to the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers and real estate acquired in connection with such construction 
once completed  these new dealerships and collision repair centers are generally sold in sale leaseback transactions 
new dealership and collision repair center capital expenditures incurred during expected to be sold within a year or sold in in sale leaseback transactions were million 
we do not expect any significant gains or losses from these sales 
as of december   commitments for facilities construction projects totaled approximately million 
we expect million of this amount to be financed through future sale leaseback transactions 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized us to expend up to million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares for approximately million which was offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options under stock compensation plans of million 
as of december  we had million remaining under our board authorization 
dividends our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends totaling per share during on february   our board of directors approved a dividend of per share for shareholders of record on march  that will be paid on april  we intend to pay dividends in the future based on available cash flows  covenant compliance and other factors 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends 
cash flows since the majority of our inventories are financed through floor plan notes payable and a significant portion of our receivables represent contracts in transit which are typically funded within ten days of the sale of the vehicle  we are not required to make significant investments in working capital that would negatively impact our operating cash flows 
therefore  our operating cash flows have approximated net income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  gains and losses on the retirement of debt  deferred taxes  the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and changes in working capital 
in  cash flows from operations was million  primarily comprised of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
cash used in investing activities in was million  the 
table of contents majority of which was related to dealership acquisitions and capital expenditures on construction in progress projects offset by proceeds received from dealership dispositions and the sales of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and was generated mostly by the proceeds from the issuance of our convertibles and net borrowings of notes payable floor plan  which were somewhat offset by the use of the proceeds to pay down of the revolving facility  the net purchase of the corresponding hedge and warrants related to the convertibles and dividends paid 
the cash flows used in funding the growth in cornerstone s notes receivable have been classified as operating activities 
cornerstone s notes receivable balances were million  million  million and million at december  through  respectively  before allowances for credit losses 
our consolidated statement of cash flows includes both continuing and discontinued operations 
net cash used in operating activities associated with discontinued operations was million and was substantially comprised of repayment of notes payable floor plan trade related to dispositions  an adjustment for depreciation and changes in assets and liabilities that relate to dealership operations 
in our consolidated statement of cash flows  cash flows from investing activities includes the line item proceeds from sale of franchises which is entirely related to discontinued operations 
with the exception of proceeds from sale of franchises and repayments of notes payable floor plan non trade related to dispositions  cash flows from investing and financing activities contain an immaterial amount of cash flows from discontinued operations 
since discontinued operations typically contain unprofitable franchises  the absence of these cash flows would generally increase consolidated cash flows from operations 
however  this increase would be substantially offset by a decrease in cash flows from proceeds from sale of franchises 
if we were to stop selling franchises  we do not anticipate that this change in strategy would impact our future liquidity and capital resources 
guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the operation and disposition of dealership franchises  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnifications 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the guarantees and indemnifications

future liquidity outlook our future obligations are as follows amounts in thousands thereafter total floor plan facilities long term debt estimated interest payments on floor plan facilities estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases construction contracts other purchase obligations acquisition purchase commitments total floor plan facilities includes amounts classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale 
amounts under the notes and the convertibles are redeemable at our option see preceding discussion regarding long term debt and credit facilities but have been classified in this schedule according to contractual maturity 
the convertibles are redeemable at both our option and the option of the holders of the convertibles in november and have  therefore  been classified for maturity in 
table of contents on february   we entered into a revolving credit facility which will expire february  in connection with this new revolving credit facility we terminated the revolving facility whose maturity was january  see long term debt and credit facilities above 
floor plan facilities balances including amounts classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale are correlated with the amount of vehicle inventory and are generally due at the time that a vehicle is sold 
estimated interest payments were calculated using the december  floor plan facilities balance  the weighted average interest rate for the fourth quarter of of and the assumption that floor plan facilities balances at december  would be relieved within sixty days in connection with the sale of the associated vehicle inventory 
estimated interest payments calculated assuming contractual maturities  no principal payments on the revolving facility before the contractual maturity and the interest rate in effect at december  for the revolving facility 
estimated interest payments do include net interest expense from our interest rate swaps 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations interest expense  other  net  and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk  for discussion regarding our interest rate swaps 
amount represents estimated purchase price of tangible and intangible assets net of floor plan facilities balances of million 
we believe our best source of liquidity for future growth remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof and our revolving facility 
though uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with geopolitical conflicts may affect our ability to generate cash from operations  we expect to generate more than sufficient cash flow to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
once these needs are met  we may use remaining cash flow to support our acquisition strategy or repurchase shares of our class a common stock or publicly traded debt securities  as market conditions warrant 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less revenue and operating profits than the second and third quarters 
weather conditions  the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality in  and may adversely affect our profitability and new vehicle demand 
parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the operation and disposition of dealership franchises  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnifications 
we expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to increase as we dispose of additional franchises 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnifications 
past performance under these guarantees and indemnifications and their estimated fair value has been immaterial to our liquidity and capital resources 
although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection with these matters  these guarantees and indemnifications  including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sublessees  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources

table of contents relationship between the trading values of our class a common stock and the convertibles 
this type of financing arrangement was selected by us in order to achieve a more favorable interest rate as opposed to other forms of available financing

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these conversion conditions which are primarily linked to the relationship between the trading values of our class a common stock and the convertibles 
since both the holders of the convertibles and we can redeem these notes on or after october   we expect that either a conversion or a redemption of these notes will occur in this type of financing arrangement was selected by us in order to achieve a more favorable interest rate as opposed to other forms of available financing 
the convertibles are material to our liquidity and capital resources 
in connection with the issuance of the convertibles we entered into convertible hedge and warrant transactions 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are designed to increase the effective conversion price per share of our class a common stock from to and  therefore  mitigate the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertibles at the time of conversion

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our variable rate floor plan facilities  revolving facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swap see below was approximately  million at december  and approximately  million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from the floor plan facilities 
our exposure with respect to floor plan facilities is mitigated by floor plan assistance payments received from manufacturers that are generally based on rates similar to those incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements 
these payments are capitalized as inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
import and luxury manufacturers  excluding cadillac  generally pay less in floor plan assistance while domestic manufactures generally pay more in floor plan assistance 
as we enrich our portfolio of dealerships with more import and luxury dealerships  we expect that amounts of floor plan assistance recognized will continue to decrease 
during and  the amounts we recognized from manufacturer floor plan assistance for both continuing and discontinued franchises exceeded our floor plan interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have had an estimated impact on floor plan assistance of approximately million in and million in should the amount of floor plan assistance payments received from manufacturers decrease from the current levels  this decrease could adversely affect our future operating results to the extent that this decrease is not recaptured in prices charged to new vehicle customers 

table of contents in addition to our variable rate debt  approximately of our dealership facilities have monthly lease payments that fluctuate based on libor interest rates 
many of our lease agreements have interest rate floors whereby our lease expense would not fluctuate significantly in periods when libor is relatively low
