items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and and a 
results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a diversified energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups retail services and wholesale energy 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment retail services group electric utility electric and gas utility wholesale energy group power generation oil and gas coal mining energy marketing and transportation our retail services group currently consists of our electric utility  black hills power  and our electric and gas utility  cheyenne light  which was acquired january  our electric utility  black hills power  inc  generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming and montana 
our electric and gas utility serves approximately  electric customers and  natural gas customers in cheyenne  wyoming and vicinity 
our wholesale energy group  which operates through black hills energy  inc and its subsidiaries  engages in the production of electric power through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under long term tolling contracts  the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  and the marketing and transportation of fuel products 
in june  we sold our subsidiary  black hills fibersystems  inc  previously reported as our communications segment 
in april  we also sold our pepperell power plant  our last remaining power plant in the eastern region  which was previously reported in our power generation segment 
in may  we sold our subsidiary  landrica development corp  which held some land and coal enhancement facilities that were previously reported in our coal mining segment 
prior period results have been reclassified to present the financial information as discontinued operations 
on january   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the operating assets of our oil marketing and transportation business 
the transaction was completed on march  these assets and their operating results have been included in this annual report on form k as part of our energy marketing and transportation segment 
beginning with the first quarter of  the assets and their operating results will be classified as part of discontinued operations 
industry overview the overall energy industry improved its financial performance in on steady demand for products and services and strong wholesale prices for natural gas and oil 
the industry also experienced significant challenges  such as the devastating effect of hurricanes  which curtailed gas and oil production in and around the gulf of mexico and disrupted utilities service across vast regions  and the effects of soaring natural gas  oil and coal prices on consumers of those commodities 
international tensions  particularly in the middle east  are contributing to the volatile condition of current energy markets 
uncertainties associated with foreign sources of crude oil imports and increasing demand for crude oil in foreign markets have influenced domestic energy prices in recent months  and future price indexes are at much higher levels than were expected a year ago 
while the energy industry is increasingly competitive due to economic change and technological innovation  the regulatory environment is likely in a transitional phase 
the repeal of puhca effective in february  and many of its restrictions on utility merger and acquisition activities  suggests that consolidation of utilities could occur in certain parts of the us in the months and years ahead 
at the federal level  transmission issues continue to receive significant attention as physical constraints and the need for more infrastructure investment becomes increasingly apparent 
the consequences of electric deregulation efforts of the s continue to challenge regulators 
these efforts were intended to encourage competition  introduce consumer choice and attract additional investment in energy resources 
in many states  electric utilities were required to disaggregate traditional functions of generation  transmission  distribution and marketing of electricity to open markets to competition 
due to a number of causes  energy consumers in some jurisdictions have been exposed to significant price increases and deterioration in service in recent years 
in  state level public utility commissions continued to evaluate the merits of regulated versus non regulated environments for utilities 
relations between investor owned utilities and regulators seemed to improve and progress was made on multi year rate cases in several jurisdictions 
in a period of high costs of fuel for power generation  industrial use and home heating  it is expected that regulators will strive to keep rates reasonable  including allowing some electric utilities to revert to vertically integrated structures again 
because the benefits of a more competitive industry were not always evident  many regulators are now seeking new policy directions to assure greater stability and end user value in the future 
a surge in investment in gas fired power generation facilities occurred in the early s 
some of that investment led to an overabundance of power capacity in certain regions of the country 
in many instances  merchant or non contracted plants became financially distressed as market prices for power fell below the cost of production for extended periods in the time frame 
many of these plants were deemed impaired and asset values were written down 
several companies abandoned their independent power production ipp strategy  sold their plants and exited the sector 
ipp facilities under contract with utilities have fared better than those subject to volatile market conditions 
mild weather over vast sections of the us in recent years  combined with slower regional economic growth  contributed to a slowdown in electric energy demand nationwide 
as a result of excess energy supply  wholesale power prices have been relatively soft for much of the last three years 
however  in december  power prices surged in response to weather related demand 
extreme pricing was short lived as weather returned to a milder pattern 
the quick response of the marketplace demonstrates that a resurgence of either colder winter months  a hotter than normal summer peaking season or increases in industrial demand could again cause volatile prices 
in addition  the availability of hydroelectric power is unpredictable and dependent on precipitation in the northwestern us power prices in the west can be affected dramatically by changing hydroelectric conditions 
in the current winter season of snow pack and moisture accumulation in watersheds feeding reservoirs in the pacific northwest  conditions point to improved hydroelectric performance relative to the last few years 
the energy industry experienced a financial crisis beginning in late  stemming from the collapse of enron corporation and the near collapse of several other leading energy companies 
the cumulative market capitalization of energy companies fell on the scale of hundreds of billions of dollars  reflecting challenging market conditions and investor attitudes 
investors and consumers lost confidence in the financial health and future prospects of many energy providers as a result of numerous events 
accordingly  energy companies have been subject to much greater scrutiny by regulators  credit rating agencies and investors 
in response  companies are moving aggressively to improve liquidity and to restructure their balance sheets 
they have abandoned unsuccessful business strategies  sold non core assets  downsized staffs  issued new equity  canceled acquisitions  postponed or canceled construction projects  reduced significant levels of capital expenditures  accelerated debt repayment and realigned trading around their own generation  mid stream and transportation assets 
in  the energy industry generally showed improved financial condition and stronger balance sheets along with adequate liquidity and access to capital markets 
the oil and gas industry has experienced significant price volatility in the past several years  from a relatively lower price environment in and to significantly higher prices for both commodities in in the s  natural gas has emerged as the national industrial fuel of choice because of its emissions characteristics  and demand has expanded significantly 
for example  most of the recent increase in power generation capacity has been gas fired  which in turn has exposed the generation companies financial performance to greater risk due to fuel price volatility 
recent favorable fuel prices have encouraged domestic oil and gas producers to increase production and reserves 
in addition  investment in liquefied natural gas port facilities is expected to increase the availability of gas supplies in future years 
the us coal industry has experienced resurgence in the past few years  with favorable commodity prices creating attractive returns 
coal prices in wyoming s powder river basin have increased dramatically in  despite its lower heat content characteristics and higher transportation costs 
from a regional perspective  powder river basin coal is a very competitive energy resource 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be an international policy issue  with opponents arguing environmental harm  despite the application of advanced emissions technology 
because coal continues to be an economical resource  its long term prospects as a significant portion of a national energy mix remains strong 
business strategy we are a customer focused diversified energy provider 
our business is comprised of fuel assets  electric generation assets and retail utility assets  including electric and gas distribution systems 
to optimize the value of those assets  we utilize our energy marketing and transportation expertise 
our focus on customers  whether retail utility customers or wholesale generation or marketing customers  provides us with opportunities to expand our various businesses 
the diversity of our operations avoids reliance on any single business to achieve our strategic objectives 
this diversity is expected to provide a measure of stability to our business and financial performance in volatile or cyclical periods 
it should help us reduce our total corporate risk and allow us to achieve stronger returns over the long term 
the strength and stability of our balance sheet is critical in today s market 
access to capital  sufficient liquidity and quality of earnings are our key drivers 
our balanced  integrated approach to fuel production  power generation  energy marketing and retail utility operations is supported by disciplined risk management practices 
our long term strategy is to continue growing our core retail utility  generation and fuel asset businesses  supplemented by our energy marketing operations 
we will do this primarily by focusing on providing superior economic and performance value to customers and increasing our customer base 
in the retail area  we will focus on acquiring new customers through the acquisition of additional retail utility properties  while maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards 
in the power generation area  we will focus on long term contractual relationships with key wholesale customers  as well as new customers  to allow us to expand existing generation sites  or to construct or acquire new generation facilities 
in the fuel area  we will continue to strive to maintain our positive relationships with mineral owners and regulatory authorities and work to develop additional markets for our production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
the expertise of our energy marketing business will continue to enable us to optimize the value of our asset businesses 
the following are key elements of our business strategy operate our lines of business as retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component consists of electric and natural gas products and services 
the wholesale component consists of fuel production  marketing  mid stream assets and power production facilities  review black hills power s rate structure for our residential  commercial and industrial customers while retaining the flexibility to selectively market excess generating capacity off system to maximize returns in changing market environments  invest in rate base generation to serve our electric utilities  expand retail operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers  conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties  sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from independent power projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns  grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce power at attractive margins  increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our production  increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales  grow our energy marketing operations primarily through the expansion of producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by the market  natural gas storage and transportation  and manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure 
operate our lines of business as retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component consists of electric and natural gas products and services 
the wholesale component consists of fuel production  marketing  mid stream assets and power production facilities 
through the retail and wholesale groups of our business  operating efficiencies are achieved 
in the retail group  the integration of customer service and marketing and promotional efforts streamline operating processes and improve productivity 
in the wholesale group  the fuel production  marketing and generation segments integrate balanced  yet diverse strategic operations 
review black hills power s rate structure for our residential  commercial and industrial customers while retaining the flexibility to selectively market excess generating capacity off system to maximize returns in changing market environments 
through a settlement with the sdpuc black hills power has been under a retail rate freeze since the rate freeze agreement terminated on january  the rate freeze preserved black hills power s low cost rate structure at levels below the national average for our retail customers while allowing us to retain the benefits from cost savings and wholesale off system sales 
this has provided us with flexibility in allocating black hills power s power supply resources to maximize returns in changing market environments 
we have historically optimized the utilization of black hills power s power supply resources by selling wholesale power to other utilities and to power marketers in the spot market and through short term sales contracts 
absent any request for a rate change by us or the sdpuc  rates will remain unchanged from those in place during the rate freeze 
we will continue to monitor our rate structure and when appropriate  we will file a rate case 
invest in rate base generation to serve our electric utilities 
our company s original business was a vertically integrated electric utility 
this business model remains a core strength today  where we operate efficient power generation resources to transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
by doing so  we provide power at reasonable and stable rates to our customers and earn solid returns to our investors 
rate based generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  they assure consumers that rates have been reviewed and approved by government authorities who are safeguarding the public interest 
second  regulators are given the opportunity to participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors  by lowering the cost of capital to the company 
expand retail operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for more than years  we have provided strong retail services  based on delivering quality and value to our customers 
that tradition and accomplishment is expected to support efforts to expand our retail operations in other markets  most likely in the west and in regions that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation and system reliability 
the january acquisition of cheyenne light and the november non binding offer to combine with northwestern corporation are examples of such expansion efforts 
retail operations also can augment other important business development  including transmission and pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could lead to advancing other wholesale operations 
regulated retail operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows and earnings 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers 
we strive to build strong relationships with utilities  municipalities and other wholesale customers  who we believe will continue to be the primary providers of electricity to retail customers in a deregulated environment 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to serve their customers reliably 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to meet our customers energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into the more volatile spot markets 
conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties 
our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we accomplish this by establishment of counterparty credit limits  continuous credit monitoring  and regular review of compliance with our credit policy by our executive risk committee that reports to our board of directors 
sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from independent power projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns 
by selling the majority of our energy and capacity under mid and long term contracts  we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
our goal is to sell a majority of our unregulated power generation under long term  pre approved contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development 
we aim to develop power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and fuel and energy marketing capabilities 
this approach seeks to capitalize on market growth while managing our fuel procurement needs 
over the next few years  we intend to grow through a combination of disciplined acquisitions and development of new power generation facilities primarily in the western regions where we believe we have the detailed knowledge of market fundamentals and competitive advantage to achieve attractive returns 
we believe the following trends will provide us with growth opportunities in the future demand for electricity in certain western regions is expected to grow and new generation capacity will be required over the next several years 
new electric generation construction will be predominantly gas fired  which may create further competitive cost advantages for new and existing coal fired generation assets 
transmission construction will significantly lag new generation development  favoring new development located near load centers or existing  unconstrained transmission locations 
disaggregation of the electric utility industry from traditionally vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission  distribution and marketing entities may continue in certain regions  thereby creating opportunities for expansions  acquisitions and joint ventures 
we believe that existing sites with opportunities for brownfield expansion generally offer the potential for greater returns than development of new sites through a greenfield strategy 
brownfield sites typically offer several competitive advantages over greenfield development  including proximity to existing transmission systems  operating cost advantages related to ownership of shared facilities  a less costly and time consuming permitting process  and potential ability to reduce capital requirements by sharing infrastructure with existing facilities at the same site 
we expanded our capacity with brownfield development at our valmont and wyodak sites in  arapahoe and las vegas sites in and our wyodak site in and currently with the ongoing construction of the wygen ii facility 
we believe that our fountain valley  harbor  wyodak and las vegas sites in particular provide further opportunities for significant expansion of our gas and coal fired generating capacity over the next several years 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce power at attractive margins 
we expect to expand our portfolio of power plants having relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
as an increasing number of gas fired power plants are brought into operation  we intend to utilize a low cost power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to protect our revenue stream 
low marginal production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving very low production costs 
our primary competitive advantage is our coal mine  which is located in close proximity to our retail service territories 
we are exploiting the competitive advantage of this native fuel source by building additional mine mouth coal fired generating capacity 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer since transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal 
increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our production 
our strategy is to expand our natural gas reserves through a combination of acquisitions and drilling programs 
we aim to maintain sufficient natural gas production either to directly serve or indirectly hedge the fuel cost exposure of our gas fired generation plants 
specifically  we plan to substantially increase our natural gas reserves while minimizing exploration risk by focusing on lower risk exploration and development drilling as well as acquisitions of proven reserves  exploit opportunities based on our belief that the long term demand for natural gas will remain strong by emphasizing natural gas in our acquisition and drilling activities  and add natural gas reserves and increase production by focusing primarily on various shallow gas plays in the rocky mountain region  where the added production can be integrated with our existing oil and natural gas operations as well as our fuel marketing and or power generation activities 
increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales 
our primary strategy is to expand our coal production through the construction of mine mouth coal fired generation plants at our wyodak mine location 
our objective is to maintain coal reserves to serve our mine mouth coal fired generation plants directly 
specifically  we plan to increase coal production and sales by continuing to develop additional mine mouth generating facilities at the site  and pursue future sales of coal to additional regional rail served and truck served customers 
grow our energy marketing operations primarily through the expansion of producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by the market  natural gas storage and transportation 
our energy marketing business seeks to provide services to producers and end users of natural gas  and to capitalize on market volatility by utilizing storage  transportation and proprietary trading positions 
the service provider focus of our energy marketing activities is what largely differentiates us from other energy marketers 
through our producer services group we assist mostly small to medium sized producers throughout the western us with marketing and transporting their natural gas to market 
through our wholesale marketing division we work with utilities  municipalities and industrial users of natural gas to provide customized delivery services as well as to support their efforts to optimize their transportation and storage positions 
in the future  we may add other energy commodities to our marketing portfolio or seek to acquire mid stream assets  such as regional pipelines  so we can further facilitate and augment our marketing services 
manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure 
our energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we have implemented risk management policies and procedures for our marketing operations that establish price risk exposure levels 
we formed oversight committees to monitor compliance with our policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining credit facilities separate from our corporate facility 
prospective information we expect long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continued capital deployment 
we believe that we are strategically positioned to take advantage of opportunities to acquire and develop energy assets consistent with our investment criteria and a prudent capital structure 
retail services group electric utility firm electric business at our electric utility  black hills power  remained strong in we believe that black hills power will produce modest growth in revenue  and absent unplanned plant outages  it will continue to produce stable earnings for the next several years 
we forecast firm energy sales in our retail service territory to increase over the next years at an annual compound growth rate of approximately one percent  with the system demand forecasted to increase at a rate of two percent 
these forecasts are derived from studies conducted by us whereby we examined and analyzed our service territory to estimate changes in the needs for electrical energy and demand over a year period 
these forecasts are only estimates  and the actual changes in electric sales may be substantially different 
weather deviations can also affect energy sales significantly when compared to forecasts based on normal weather 
the portion of the utility s future earnings that will result from wholesale off system sales will depend on many factors  including native load growth  plant availability  electricity demand and commodity prices 
on january   the south dakota retail rate freeze under which black hills power has operated since january   expired 
the current south dakota retail electric rates  along with the wyoming retail electric rates  have been in place since the summer of these rates  which have remained flat for more than years  do not include fuel and or purchased power adjustment clauses  but allow black hills power to retain the benefits of off system wholesale sales and cost reductions 
black hills power s return is affected by changes in fuel prices  inflation  capital investment  capital markets  and retail and wholesale power sales 
we will monitor these potential impacts in order to ensure that our return remains adequate for its investment to serve customers 
if necessary  increases to rates will be sought through the regulatory process 
electric and gas utility we acquired cheyenne light on january  we requested and received approval from the wpsc for a rate increase that went into effect on january  and will increase annual revenues by an expected million 
we also expect additional costs in related to allocated corporate costs to total approximately million 
we began construction on wygen ii  a megawatt baseload coal fired power plant 
the plant will be a regulated asset of cheyenne light 
the facility is expected to cost approximately million  including interim financing costs during construction 
this power plant is expected to be in commercial operation in early and will require a future rate review with the wpsc in order to recover capital and provide a return on invested capital 
presently  power is provided by public service company of colorado under an all requirements contract  which expires december  wholesale energy group power generation we expect lower earnings  excluding the impairment charges in  from our power generation segment in primarily as a result of maintenance issues at our las vegas facility 
in january  the las vegas ii plant was taken off line for diagnosis and initiation of repairs of both of its heat recovery steam turbine generators 
we have restored two thirds of the plant capacity and energy availability through simple cycle generation but expect the maintenance period to extend into the second quarter of the negative financial impact of this unplanned outage is under evaluation  and is currently expected to be in the range of to per share 
at the las vegas i power plant  an extensive maintenance program initiated in the fourth quarter of continues  and plant repairs and upgrades are expected to be completed in april significant earnings provided by power fund investments in are not expected in and beyond 
during two of the funds in which we invest liquidated a substantial portion of their underlying power plant investments  generally realizing large gains over the expected fair market value  and a third fund achieved certain performance thresholds that triggered an equity flip increasing our ownership interest  from which we recorded a benefit 
oil and gas we expect that earnings from this segment over the next few years will be driven primarily by increased oil and gas production 
driven by our march acquisition of mallon resources and the ongoing subsequent development of these properties  our compound annual production growth on a per mcfe basis has been approximately percent since our pre acquisition level 
our long term compound annual production growth target is percent 
in we expect to achieve our production growth target and benefit from a strong pricing environment  even while drilling and completion costs continue to rise  as shortages persist in the industry 
we expect to deploy approximately million of capital in developing our current properties  including the piceance basin gas assets acquired from red oak capital management  llc in december this forecast does not include the acquisition or future development costs of the koch properties that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire during march our drilling program is focused on both proved reserves and the further delineation of existing fields 
we have also commenced an oil well development drilling program on our existing properties in northeast wyoming 
energy marketing and transportation on march  we completed the sale of our crude oil marketing and transportation assets with a sales price of approximately million 
we expect to record a gain on the sale and cash proceeds are expected to be used for debt reduction or other corporate purposes 
beginning with the first quarter of  operating results from these assets will be classified as discontinued operations and will not contribute to the earnings of this segment in earnings from these operations were approximately million in in addition  due to the required gross presentation of crude oil marketing revenues and cost of sales  future revenues and operating expenses will decrease significantly while having no significant impact on earnings 
during  revenues and cost of sales generated from the operating assets sold were million and million  respectively 
coal mining we expect lower earnings from our coal mining operations in resulting from a major planned outage at the wyodak power plant  the mine s largest customer 
the outage is expected to last approximately six weeks and occur during the second quarter of results of operations consolidated results overview revenue and income loss from continuing operations provided by each business group were as follows in thousands revenue retail services wholesale energy corporate income loss from continuing operations retail services wholesale energy corporate in june  we sold our subsidiary  black hills fibersystems  inc  previously reported as our communications segment 
in april  we also sold our pepperell power plant  our last remaining power plant in the eastern region  which was previously reported in our power generation segment 
in may  we sold our subsidiary  landrica development corp  which held some land and coal enhancement facilities that were previously reported in our coal mining segment 
in september  we sold our hydroelectric power plants located in upstate new york 
these discontinued operations were previously reported in the power generation segment

the wholesale energy group s income from continuing operations decreased million in compared to decreased earnings from power generation of million and from coal mining of million were offset by increased income from continuing operations of million at our oil and gas operations and million from energy marketing and transportation operations 
the retail services group s income from continuing operations increased million in compared to earnings from the electric and gas utility  acquired january   were million and earnings from continuing operations from the electric utility decreased million 
corporate costs for the year ended december  increased million after tax  compared to the increase is primarily due to the write off of approximately million  after tax of certain capitalized project development costs and the expensing of other development costs  which are included in administrative and general operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
these costs were partially offset by allocating increased compensation and debt retirement costs down to the subsidiary level 
in addition  the company s subsidiary  daksoft  inc  recorded a million pre tax gain in  on the sale of its campground reservation system 
consolidated operating expenses for increased million compared to increased operating expenses reflect a million increase in fuel and purchased power  a million impairment charge at our power generation segment and a million increase in administrative and general costs 
higher fuel and purchased power costs were primarily the result of the increased cost of crude oil marketed and the cost of sales of electricity and gas at cheyenne light  which was acquired during the increase in administrative and general costs was primarily the result of higher corporate development costs  including the write off of previously capitalized development costs  higher legal and professional fees resulting from ongoing litigation  the additional administrative and general costs of cheyenne light  and higher compensation costs

firm commercial  residential and contract wholesale sales increased percent  percent and percent  respectively 
cooling degree days for the year were percent higher than and heating degree days were percent lower than wholesale off system sales increased percent due to a percent increase in average price received partially offset by a percent decrease in megawatt hours sold 
electric operating expenses increased percent for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
higher operating expenses were primarily the result of an million increase in fuel and purchased power costs 
the increase in fuel and purchased power was due to a million increase in purchased power  which includes million of additional purchase power costs to cover the outage of neil simpson ii  as well as a percent increase in average price per megawatt hour  and a percent increase in megawatt hours purchased 
fuel costs increased million due to a percent increase in average cost  partially offset by a percent decrease in megawatt hours generated 
megawatt hours produced through coal fired generation decreased while higher cost gas generation was utilized in purchased power and gas generation were utilized for firm load demand and peaking needs due to unscheduled plant outages and warmer weather 
the increase in operating expense was also affected by increased power marketing legal expense  compensation costs and corporate allocations  partially offset by lower maintenance costs due to scheduled and unscheduled plant maintenance in income from continuing operations decreased million primarily due to increased fuel and purchased power costs  legal expense  compensation costs and corporate allocations  partially offset by increased revenues  lower maintenance costs  lower interest expense due to the pay down of debt  and a million benefit from a deferred tax adjustment

residential and commercial sales decreases of percent and percent  respectively  in accounted for a million decrease in revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in industrial sales 
the percent increase in wholesale off system megawatt hours accounted for a million increase in revenues 
cooling degree days were percent lower than and heating degree days were percent lower than electric utility operating expenses increased million due to a million increase in fuel and purchased power cost  a million increase in certain operations and maintenance costs  including scheduled and unscheduled maintenance costs  increased group insurance and corporate allocations and increased costs associated with the increase in wholesale off system sales  partially offset by decreased interest expense of million  primarily due to retirement of debt 
the increase in fuel and purchased power cost was due to an million increase in purchased power costs  offset by a million decrease in fuel costs  as prevailing gas prices made it more economical for us to purchase power for our peaking needs and increased off system sales  rather than generate energy utilizing our gas turbines

in the twelve months of  our las vegas ii facility sold capacity and energy to nevada power company under a long term tolling arrangement  which became effective april   as opposed to selling power into the market on a merchant basis for the first three months of  only when it was economic to do so 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  due primarily to a million impairment charge on the las vegas i plant  a million impairment of goodwill relating to certain power fund investments  increased fuel costs at our gillette ct  a million charge related to a fuel contract termination and increased corporate allocations 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a reduction in fuel expense at the las vegas ii facility  which incurred fuel costs in the first three months of  before the new  long term tolling arrangement took effect and lower fuel expense at las vegas i due to planned maintenance in the fourth quarter of income from continuing operations decreased million  primarily due to the million after tax impact of the las vegas i impairment charge  a fuel contract termination charge and increased corporate allocations and deferred tax adjustments that lowered earnings by million  partially offset by a million after tax increase in earnings from certain power fund investments 
plant availability of our contracted fleet was affected by the planned maintenance at las vegas i and unplanned outages at las vegas ii 
excluding las vegas facilities  the availability of the remainder of our gas fired fleet was approximately percent and availability of our wygen i coal fired plant exceeded percent 
compared to power generation segment income from continuing operations decreased to million in from million in earnings decreased primarily as the result of lower earnings at our las vegas ii plant 
during the first quarter of  prevailing regional power market conditions limited the economic dispatch of this plant subsequent to the termination of the plant s long term contract in september  and for the remainder of the year  lower contract rates on the new long term contract 
the lower revenue was partially offset by lower depreciation expense at that plant 
the decline in segment earnings was also due to higher fuel costs at las vegas i  lower revenues at our harbor plant  offset by lower fuel cost  due to the expiration of a summer peaking agreement  and higher interest expense due to the december  consolidation of our wygen i plant 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased million after tax primarily due to the impact of mark to market adjustments at certain power fund investments that use a fair value method of accounting 
these items were partially offset by lower fuel costs at our gillette combustion turbine  a benefit from certain tax adjustments  lower interest expense due to the pay down of debt  and higher earnings from other revenues 
in addition  the segment s earnings were affected by certain non recurring items  netting to a benefit of approximately million after tax 
oil and gas oil and gas operating results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following is a summary of oil and natural gas production barrels of oil sold mcf of natural gas sold mcf equivalent sales the following is a summary of lease operating expense mcfe at december new mexico all other properties total loe lease operating expenses loe at our new mexico properties include approximately mcfe in and  and mcfe in for gathering  compression and processing costs 
in the east blanco field in new mexico  we own and operate the gas gathering system  including associated compression and processing facilities 
the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves and present value of estimated future net revenues discounted using a percent rate  at december barrels of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total in mmcf equivalents present value of estimated future net revenues before tax in thousands these reserves are based on reports prepared by ralph e 
davis associates  inc  an independent consulting and engineering firm 
reserves were determined using constant product prices at the end of the respective years 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables  which may differ from actual results 
reserves reflect year end pricing of oil gas oil gas oil gas year end prices nymex year end prices average well head compared to revenues from oil and gas increased percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gas volumes sold increased percent due to increased production from recently completed wells  and oil volumes sold decreased percent primarily due to a normal decline in our mature wyoming oil field and reduced enhanced oil recovery activities 
average natural gas price received  net of hedges and exclusive of gas liquids  for the year ended december  was mcf compared to mcf in the same period of average oil price received  net of hedges  for the year ended december  was bbl compared to bbl in the same period of lease operating expense increased percent primarily due to generally higher field service costs experienced industry wide and the increase in number of producing wells as a result of the current drilling program 
the loe mcfe for the year decreased percent from mcfe in to mcfe in due to higher production rates and efficiencies realized in certain of our fields where significant production increases have been achieved 
depletion expense per mcfe excluding liquids increased percent over the prior year from mcfe in to mcfe in the average depletion rate per mcfe is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented 
the increased rate is primarily a reflection of higher industry wide drilling and completion costs that significantly increased our estimated future development costs in addition to lower than expected reserve estimates 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to a percent increase in volumes sold  primarily related to a full year of production from properties acquired in the march mallon resources acquisition 
average gas price received  net of hedges and exclusive of gas liquids  for the year ended december  was mcf compared to mcf in the same period of average oil price received  net of hedges  for the year ended december  was bbl compared to bbl in total operating expenses increased percent primarily related to increased depletion  production taxes and operating costs associated with the increased production as well as higher corporate cost allocations 
in addition  lease operating expenses per mcfe sold loe mcfe increased percent from per mcfe to per mcfe  and depletion per mcfe sold increased percent from per mcfe to per mcfe 
additional information on our oil and gas operations can be found in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
energy marketing and transportation our energy marketing and transportation companies produced the following results in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following is a summary of energy marketing average daily volumes natural gas physical sales mmbtus natural gas financial sales mmbtus crude oil barrels marketed crude oil barrels transported compared to revenue increases were primarily due to a percent increase in average price received from crude oil marketed  partially offset by decreased crude oil volumes marketed 
in addition  gas marketing margins increased while oil transportation revenues decreased primarily due to suspension of shipments for routine regulatory required pressure testing of the millennium pipeline system 
income from continuing operations increased million primarily due to higher margins and volumes at our gas marketing operation and higher margins from oil marketing operations and a positive foreign tax credit reserve adjustment of million 
these items were partially offset by a charge for a litigation settlement accrual of million relating to a class action lawsuit  initiated in  that alleged false reporting of natural gas price and volume information and lower oil transportation earnings 
gas marketing unrealized mark to market gains for the year ended december  were million higher than unrealized mark to market losses for the same period in we expect approximately million of the unrealized mark to market gain to reverse in in addition  realized gross margins from natural gas and crude oil marketing increased million 
on january   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the operating assets of our crude oil marketing and transportation business 
this transaction was completed march  beginning with the first quarter of  the operations of this business will be classified as discontinued operations 
crude oil marketing revenues and cost of sales are presented on a gross basis in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the classification to discontinued operations will have a significant effect on our consolidated presented revenues and cost of sales 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from crude oil marketing and transportation were million  million and million  and related cost of sales were million  million and million  respectively 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million due to a percent increase in natural gas volumes marketed and a percent increase in natural gas margins received 
earnings were also impacted by increased earnings from oil transportation and marketing due to increased transportation revenues and higher marketing margins 
decreased oil marketing revenues were more than offset by lower cost of sales resulting in the higher marketing margins 
these increases were partially offset by unrealized losses recognized through mark to market accounting treatment of million in compared to gains of million in resulting in a year over year decrease of million pre tax 
in addition  earnings were negatively impacted by the million cftc settlement 
coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following is a summary of coal sales quantities thousands of tons tons of coal sold coal reserves compared to revenue from our coal mining segment increased percent for the year ended december  compared to in  the company reached a tax settlement with the wyoming department of revenue which resulted in a million reduction in revenues and a corresponding reduction in mineral taxes in september  the company also recorded an additional million decrease to mineral taxes and million decrease to interest expense related to the settlement 
revenues were also impacted by a percent decrease in tons of coal sold  primarily due to unscheduled plant outages at the neil simpson ii and wyodak power plants  offset by higher average prices 
operating expenses increased percent for the year ended december  primarily due to the reduction of mineral tax expense due to the recording of the tax settlement and increased transportation and overburden removal costs and compensation expense and corporate allocations  partially offset by decreased depletion expense  due to lower depletion rates 
income from continuing operations decreased percent primarily due to increased transportation and overburden removal costs and compensation expense and corporate allocations  partially offset by the decrease in depletion expense 
in addition  results were affected by a million benefit from an income tax reserve adjustment and a million after tax benefit from the wyoming tax settlement 
compared to income from continuing operations decreased percent as a result of lower revenues due primarily to scheduled and unscheduled plant outages and an increase in depreciation expense partially offset by lower general and administrative and direct mining costs 
decreased coal tons sold were primarily the result of scheduled and unscheduled plant maintenance outages at the wyodak plant partially offset by increased sales to the wygen i plant 
in  the company recorded a million reduction in revenues and a corresponding reduction in mineral taxes as a result of a tax settlement with the wyoming department of revenue 
the company also recorded an additional million decrease to mineral taxes and million decrease to interest expense in related to settlement accruals and a million benefit from an income tax reserve adjustment 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note  business description and summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
although we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
during the third quarter of  in accordance with our accounting policies  we evaluated for impairment the long lived asset carrying values of our las vegas i power plant 
in measuring the fair value of the las vegas i power plant and the resulting impairment charge of approximately million pre tax  we considered a number of possible cash flow models associated with the various probable operating assumptions and pricing for the capacity and energy of the facility 
we then made our best determination of the relative likelihood of the various models in computing a weighted average expected cash flow for the facility 
inclusion of other possible cash flow scenarios and or different weighting of those that were included could have led to different conclusions about the fair value of the plant 
further  the weighted average cash flow method is sensitive to the discount rate assumption 
if we had used a discount rate that was percent higher  the resulting impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
if the discount rate would have been percent lower  the impairment charge would have been approximately million lower 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off goodwill of approximately million  net of accumulated amortization of million  related to partnership equity flips at certain power fund investments 
as these funds follow accounting policies which require their plant investments to be carried at fair value  our goodwill represented an excess investment cost in the funds that was only supported by the value of the potential increased partnership equity 
when the equity flip was triggered by performance thresholds being met  the value of the additional partnership interest was recognized and our related goodwill impaired 
in  an impairment charge of approximately million after tax was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the pepperell plant to its estimated fair value  less cost to sell and is included in loss income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes on the consolidated statement of income 
as a result of the transaction terminating a fifteen year contract with allegheny energy supply company  llc  for capacity and energy at the company s las vegas cogeneration ii power plant  we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of the facility 
the carrying value of the assets tested for impairment was million 
this assessment resulted in a pre tax impairment charge of million to write down the related property  plant and equipment by million  net of accumulated depreciation of million  and intangible assets by million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
this charge reflects the amount by which the carrying value of the facility exceeded its estimated fair value determined by its estimated future discounted cash flows 
in measuring the fair value of the las vegas ii power plant and the resulting impairment charge  we considered a number of possible cash flow models associated with the various probable operating assumptions and pricing for the capacity and energy of the facility 
we then made our best determination of the relative likelihood of the various models in computing a weighted average expected cash flow for the facility 
utilization of other possible cash flow scenarios and or different weighting of those that were accepted could have led to different conclusions about the fair value of the plant 
further  the weighted average cash flow method is sensitive to the discount rate assumption 
if we had used a discount rate that was percent higher  the resulting impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
if the discount rate would have been percent lower  the impairment charge would have been approximately million lower 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceilings test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas prices at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
although our net capitalized costs were less than the full cost ceiling at december   we cannot assure you that a write down in the future will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
in addition  we annually rely on an independent consulting and engineering firm to verify the estimates we use to determine the amount of our proved reserves and those estimates are based on a number of assumptions about variables 
we cannot assure you that these assumptions will not differ from actual results 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  as we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated units of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
the estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves have been reviewed by independent petroleum engineers 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note risk management activities  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
accounting for derivatives under sfas requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into at our oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary to fix the price received for anticipated future production  and interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
our marketing and trading operations utilize various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage our marketing and trading portfolios 
fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
counterparty credit risk we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit and tenor limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current financial information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we cannot be assured that our credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
those assumptions  as further described in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements  include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels and healthcare costs 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
defined benefit pension plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions sfas 
in accordance with sfas  changes in pension obligations associated with fluctuations in long term actuarial assumptions may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded non cash expense related to our pension plans of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity securities 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan and weight the returns by applying the assumed rate of return for each asset class to the target allocation for each asset class in the portfolio 
the value of our qualified pension plan assets increased million to million for the plan fiscal year ended september  plan assets earned million in plan assets increased million to million as of september  plan assets earned million in in the recently completed actuarial valuation  for determining our pension expense  we decreased the assumed rate of return on plan assets from percent to percent 
this change is expected to increase pension costs in and beyond by approximately million per year 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was percent  percent and percent for the  and plan years  respectively 
the percent assumed rate of return for the plan year was determined based on the following estimated long term investment allocations and asset class returns asset class estimated allocation estimated return weighted average return equity fixed income cash the plan s expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is based upon the weighted average expected long term rate of returns for individual asset classes 
the asset class weighting is determined using the target allocation for each asset class in the plan portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return for each asset class is determined primarily from long term historical returns for the asset class  with adjustments if it is anticipated that long term future returns will not achieve historical results 
the plan s investment policy has been modified for to target an allocation of percent us stocks  percent foreign stocks and percent fixed income 
the expected long term rate of return for equity investments was percent and percent for the and plan years  respectively 
for determining the expected long term rate of return for equity assets  the company reviewed interest rate trends and annual    and year returns for the s p index  which were  at december   percent  percent  percent and percent respectively 
fund management fees were estimated to be percent for s p index assets and percent for other assets 
the expected long term rate of return on fixed income investments was percent  the return was based upon historical returns on year treasury bonds of percent from to and adjusted for recent declines in interest rates 
the expected long term rate of return on cash investments was estimated to be percent  expected cash returns were estimated to be percent below fixed income investments 
the discount rate we utilize for determining benefit obligations and benefit cost is based on high grade bond rates 
the discount rate was percent for the and pension cost determination  a decrease from percent in in the recently completed actuarial valuation  for determining our pension expense  we decreased the discount rate to percent 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would cause annual pension expense to increase by approximately million 
during the first quarter of  a contribution of million was made to the cheyenne light  fuel power company pension plan 
based on our recently completed plan forecasts  we estimate that we will not be required to make any additional cash contributions to our pension plans in the fiscal year 
actual pension expense and contributions required will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plan 
we will continue to evaluate all of the actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  including the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rate  and will adjust the assumptions as necessary 
non qualified pension plans we have various supplemental retirement plans for our key executives 
the plans are nonqualified defined benefit plans accounted for in accordance with sfas expenses recognized under the plans were million in  million in  and million in the plans are unfunded 
the actuarial assumptions used for our non qualified pension plans are the same as those used for our qualified plan  except for the assumptions for rate of increases in compensation levels 
other postretirement benefits we account for our other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we do not pre fund our other postretirement benefit plans 
our reported costs of providing other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including healthcare cost trends  and result from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
as a result of these factors  significant portions of other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect the actual benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in accordance with sfas actual payments of benefits to retirees during these periods were approximately million per year 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate 
impact on december  accumulated postretirement impact on service change in assumption benefit obligation and interest cost in thousands increase decrease in selecting assumed healthcare cost trend rates  we consider recent plan experience and various short and long term cost forecasts for the healthcare industry 
based on these considerations  the healthcare cost trend rate used by the actuaries to determine our other postretirement benefit expense for expense determination was percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for expense determination was percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits 
see the defined benefit pension plan discussion above regarding our discount rate assumptions 
contingencies when it is probable that an environmental  tax or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we were unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december  and is presented in the following table percentage financial position summary change in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio our dividend payout ratio at december  was approximately percent which is higher than levels over the past years 
based on current expectations for  we expect payout ratios for to be in the range of percent to percent 
in  we expect our beginning cash balance  cash provided from operations  and available credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our normal operating commitments  to pay dividends and to fund a portion of planned capital expenditures 
we would expect to fund a significant portion of any additional investment in power generating facilities with long term debt 
cash flow activities in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
cash flows from operations increased million from the prior year amount  as a million decrease in net income was more than offset by the following an million increase related to non cash charges for the impairment of our las vegas i power plant and goodwill at certain power fund investments of million  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  the write off of capitalized project development costs of million  increases related to employee benefit plans of million and increases of regulatory assets of million  primarily related to the cheyenne light acquisition 
a million increase in the change in current operating assets and liabilities 
this is primarily driven by million less being spent on material  supplies and fuel during the year 
fluctuations in our material  supplies and fuel balances are largely the result of natural gas inventory held by our natural gas marketing company in the form of storage agreements 
a million decrease from changes in deferred income taxes  largely the result of decreases in our net deferred tax liability primarily due to impairment charges  net operating losses  depreciation and other plant related differences  and employee benefit plans  partially offset by increases from mining development and oil exploration costs 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  primarily for construction expenditures for wygen ii  acquisitions and development drilling of oil and gas properties and property  plant and equipment additions in the normal course of business and the million cash payment related to the acquisition of cheyenne light  partially offset by million cash received for the sale of black hills fibersystems 
we had cash outflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to the repayment of million of project level debt at our fountain valley facility and the payment of cash dividends partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings 
in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
we funded property and investment additions primarily through a combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow 
cash flows from operations decreased million from the prior year amount  primarily due to the net effect of the las vegas ii power plant sales contract termination and related impairment charge partially offset by a million increase in the change in deferred taxes  a million increase in the change in current operating assets and liabilities primarily due to increases in accounts payable and decreases in prepaid income taxes  offset by increased inventory  and a million increase in depreciation and depletion expense 
in  we recognized a substantial increase in our deferred income tax liability due to timing differences associated with mining development and oil exploration costs and accelerated depreciation and other plant related costs 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  primarily for property  plant and equipment additions in the normal course of business 
we had cash outflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to the repayment of million of long term debt  partially offset by a million increase in short term borrowings and the refinancing of million of pollution control revenue bonds 
a detailed description of the significant investing and financing activities follows on january   we repaid million of the long term debt outstanding on the project level debt at our fountain valley facility 
on may   we repurchased million of our percent senior unsecured notes due on may   we closed on a million day credit facility  which replaced the million facility which was due to expire in august we also amended our million multi year facility that expires in august to conform its compliance calculation to the same calculation as in the new million facility 
we had borrowings of million under these facilities at december  after inclusion of applicable letters of credit  the remaining borrowing capacity under the facilities was million at december  on august   we effected a call on black hills power s million  percent pollution control revenue bonds issued through lawrence county  south dakota 
the bonds had a maturity date of on october   we effected a call and refinanced black hills power s million of pollution control revenue bonds 
million of the bonds had a maturity date of and million of the bonds had a maturity date of on october   we effected a call on black hills power s entire million series ab percent first mortgage bonds 
the bonds had a maturity date of dividends dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in this reflects an increase in comparison to prior years dividend levels of per share in and per share in all dividends were paid out of operating cash flows 
our three year annualized dividend growth rate was percent 
in january  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend percent to cents per share 
if this dividend is maintained during  it will be equivalent to per share  an annual increase of cents per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity include our cash on hand  our revolving credit facility and cash provided by operations 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash unrestricted for operations and million of credit through a revolving bank facility 
our revolving credit facility can be used to fund our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million of bank borrowings outstanding and million of letters of credit issued under this facility  with a remaining borrowing capacity of million 
approximately million of the cash balance at december  was restricted by subsidiary debt agreements that limit our subsidiaries ability to dividend cash to the parent company 
on may   we entered into a new million revolving credit facility with abn amro as administrative agent  union bank of california and us bank as co syndication agents  bank of america and harris nesbitt as co documentation agents  and other syndication participants 
the new facility has a five year term  expiring may  the facility contains a provision which allows the facility size to be increased by up to an additional million through the addition of new lenders  or through increased commitments from existing lenders  but only with the consent of such lenders 
the cost of borrowings or letters of credit issued under the new facility is determined based on our credit ratings  at our current ratings levels  the facility has an annual facility fee of basis points  and has a borrowing spread of basis points over the libor which equates to a percent one month borrowing rate as of december  
in conjunction with entering into the new revolving credit facility  we terminated our million revolving bank facility due may  and our million facility due august  the above credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions and maintenance of the following financial covenants a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and percent of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning january   a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to  and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to a default under the credit facility may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants or certain other covenants under the credit facility  a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  debt obligations of million or more 
a default under the credit facility would permit the participating banks to restrict the company s ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans with interest and require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility prohibits the company from paying cash dividends unless no default or no event of default exists prior to  or would result after  giving effect to such action 
if these covenants are violated and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment thereof  the lender would have the right to declare an event of default  terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate the payment of all principal and interest outstanding 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above covenants

at december   bher was compliant with  or issued waivers for  the debt covenants related to this facility 
on march   in conjunction with the sale of the assets of bher  the facility was terminated

forecasted capital requirements do not include the acquisition or future development costs of the koch properties that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire during march we continue to actively evaluate potential future acquisitions and other growth opportunities in accordance with our disclosed business strategy 
we are not obligated to a project until a definitive agreement is entered into and cannot guarantee we will be successful on any potential projects 
future projects are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  actual expenditures may vary significantly from forecasted estimates 
market risk disclosures our activities in the regulated and unregulated energy sector expose us to a number of risks in the normal operations of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing businesses  our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and fuel procurement for our gas fired generation assets  interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our natural gas marketing business transacted in canadian dollars 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
the executive risk committee composed of senior level executives meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
trading activities natural gas marketing we have a natural gas marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators and industrial customers with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing and trading third party natural gas 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial instruments including over the counter swaps and options and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our gas marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the gas marketing commodity risk policies and procedures crpp as approved by the executive risk committee 
as a general policy  we permit only limited market risk positions as clearly defined in these policies and procedures 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor  and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas portfolio 
we measure and monitor the market risk inherent in the natural gas trading portfolio employing value at risk var analysis and scenario analysis 
var is a statistical measure that quantifies the probability and magnitude of potential future losses related to open contract positions 
we use scenario analysis to test the impact of extreme moves in both specific delivery points and overall commodity prices on our portfolio value 
we also monitor and limit our market risk by establishing limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location  and duration 
var calculations are also used to quantify the potential loss in fair value of the entire trading portfolio over a particular time  with a specified likelihood of occurrence  due to adverse market price changes 
we use an external var model from a third party vendor and utilize independent commodity pricing data 
the modeling of var involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
inputs for the var calculation include commodity prices  positions  instrument valuations  and variance covariance matrices 
while we believe that our assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is currently no standardized methodology or widely accepted best practice for calculating var in the energy sector 
we calculate var on a daily basis to determine the potential three day favorable and unfavorable changes to the market value of our portfolio 
the var is computed utilizing monte carlo simulation based on correlation matrices for price movements over a specified period generally ranging from one to three months to simulate forward price curves in the natural gas markets to estimate the worst case outcomes on the existing portfolio value 
the var computations utilize a percent loss level for a three day holding period with a percent confidence level 
this calculation means that there is a one in one hundred in statistical chance that the portfolio value will fall below the expected maximum potential reduction in portfolio value at least as large as the reported var over a three day period  provided that no mitigation actions are taken during these three days 
in addition to var analysis  risk management daily activities include scrutinizing positions  assessing changes in daily mark to market  simulating price movements  and other non statistical risk management techniques that do not include var 
in  our three day  percent loss level var was always estimated to be below million 
at year end and  our estimate of three day  percent loss level var was approximately million and million  respectively 
actual commodity price volatility can result in portfolio values worse than predicted using the var model 
the var methodology assumes a normal distribution of price changes  thus  if the actual distribution is not normal  the var may understate actual results 
var is used to estimate the risk of the entire gas marketing portfolio 
for locations that have insufficient daily trading activity  var may not accurately estimate risk due to limited price information 
therefore  stress tests are employed  in addition to var  to further measure risk when market price information may prove insufficient 
var is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that past changes in assumed market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
var should be evaluated in light of this and the methodology s other limitations 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the activity in our energy trading portfolio that has been recorded at fair value under a mark to market method of accounting during the year ended december  in thousands total fair value of natural gas marketing marked to market at december  a net cash settled during the year on positions that existed at december  unrealized gain on new positions entered during the year and still existing at december  realized gain on positions that existed at december  and were settle d during year unrealized loss on positions that existed at december  and still exist at december  total fair value of natural gas marketing positions marked to market at december   a a the fair value of positions marked to market consists of derivative assets l iabilities and natural gas inventory that has been designated as a hedged item and marked to market as part of a fair value hedge  as follows in thousands december  december  net derivative assets liabilities fair value adjustment recorded in material  supplies and fuel on january   the company adopted eitf issue no 
the adoption of eitf resulted in certain energy trading activities no longer being accounted for at fair value  therefore  the above reconciliation does not present a complete picture of our overall portfolio of trading activities and our expected cash flows from those operations 
eitf was superseded by eitf and allowed a broad interpretation of what constituted trading activity and hence what would be marked to market 
eitf took a much narrower view of what trading activity should be marked to market  limiting mark to market treatment primarily to only those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas at our natural gas marketing operations  we often employ strategies that include derivative contracts along with inventory  storage and transportation positions to accomplish the objectives of our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing groups 
except in circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  sfas does not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our natural gas marketing positions are economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
at december   we had a mark to fair value unrealized gain of million for our natural gas marketing activities 
of this amount  million was current and million was non current 
the source of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value and thereafter total fair value actively quoted ie  exchange traded prices prices provided by other external sources modeled total the following table presents a reconciliation of our natural gas marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our natural gas forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market 
the approach used in determining the non gaap measure is consistent with our previous accounting methods under eitf in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and industry practice  the company includes a liquidity reserve in its gaap marked to market fair value 
this liquidity reserve accounts for the estimated impact of the bid ask spread in a liquidation scenario under which the company is forced to liquidate its forward book on the balance sheet date 
fair value of our natural gas marketing positions marked to market in accord ance with gaap see footnote a above increase decrease in fair value of inventory  storage and transportation p ositions that are part of our forward trading book  but that are not marked to market under gaap fair value of all forward positions non gaap liquidity reserve included in gaap marked to market fair value fair value of all forward positions excluding liquidity reserve non gaap activities other than trading oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
any hedging strategies are conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective 
as more fully defined in the next section  we have some fuel procurement risk within our gas fired generation business 
therefore  hedging in the oil and gas segment considers any natural hedge offsets in the power generation segment 
in certain cases  we do not hedge forecasted natural gas production when we have offsetting market risk in our fuel requirements in the power generation segment 
in other words  exploration and production s natural length is used to offset generation s short position 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and fair values of our contracts used to hedge portions of our crude oil and natural gas production at december  and are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we use over the counter swaps and options 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated  and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume mmbtu day price san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume barrels month price nymex swap calendar nymex put calendar nymex put nymex swap calendar nymex swap calendar nymex swap calendar power generation we have a portfolio of gas fired generation assets located throughout several western states 
the output from most of these generation assets are sold under long term tolling contracts with third parties whereby any commodity price risk is transferred to the third party 
however  we do have certain gas fired generation assets under long term contracts that do possess market risk for fuel purchases 
it is our policy that fuel risk  to the extent possible  be hedged 
since we are long natural gas in our exploration and production segment  we look at our enterprise wide natural gas market risk when hedging at the subsidiary level 
therefore  we may attempt to hedge only enterprise wide long or short positions 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows in thousands weighted pre tax average maximum accumulated fixed terms non non other interest in current current current current comprehensive pre tax december  notional rate years assets assets liabilities liabilities loss loss swaps on project financing december  swaps on project financing we anticipate a portion of unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be realized as increased interest expense in based on december  market interest rates  less than million will be realized as additional interest expense during estimated and realized amounts will likely change during as market interest rates change 
at december   we had million of outstanding  variable rate debt of which million was not offset with interest rate swap transactions that effectively convert a portion of the debt to a fixed rate 
a basis point increase in interest rates would cause interest expense to increase million in the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our short term investments and long term debt obligations  including current maturities in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents fixed rate long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate a average interest rate total long term debt average interest rate a approximately percent of the variable rate long term debt has been hedged with interest rate swaps moving the floating rates to fixed rates with an average interest rate of percent 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the black hills corporation credit policy bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee composed of senior executives meets on a regular basis to review the company s credit activities and to monitor compliance with the policies adopted by the company 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we attempt to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at the end of the year  our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utility segments was concentrated with investment grade companies 
approximately percent of our credit exposure was with investment grade companies 
for the percent credit exposure with non investment grade rated counterparties  approximately percent of this exposure was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  parental guarantees or asset liens 
foreign exchange contracts our gas marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell approximately million and million canadian dollars  respectively 
at december  and  we also had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million canadian dollars  respectively 
these contracts had a fair value of million at december  and  and have been recorded as derivative assets liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  settle by may new accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards adopted in or pending adoption
