overview the company and its subsidiaries underwrite property and casualty insurance in new jersey and pennsylvania 
beginning october   with the acquisition of financial pacific insurance group financial pacific  the group expanded its underwriting territories to california  arizona  nevada and oregon 
our consolidated operating insurance company subsidiaries are mercer insurance company  a pennsylvania property and casualty stock insurance company offering insurance coverages to businesses and individuals in new jersey and pennsylvania  and new york beginning in  mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc  a new jersey property and casualty stock insurance company offering insurance coverages to businesses and individuals located in new jersey  and new york beginning in  and franklin insurance company  a pennsylvania property and casualty stock insurance company offering private passenger automobile and homeowners insurances to individuals located in pennsylvania  and financial pacific insurance company  a california property and casualty stock insurance company offering insurance and surety products to small to medium sized commercial businesses in california  arizona  nevada and oregon and direct mail surety products to commercial businesses in various other states 
we manage our business and report our operating results in three operating segments commercial lines insurance  personal lines insurance and the investment function 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
however  we do not allocate assets to segments  and assets are reviewed in the aggregate for decision making purposes 
our commercial lines insurance business consists primarily of multi peril and general liability and related coverages 
our personal lines insurance business consists primarily of homeowners only in new jersey and pennsylvania and private passenger automobile only in pennsylvania insurance coverages 
we market both the commercial and personal insurance lines through independent agents 
our income is principally derived from insurance premiums received from insureds in the commercial lines businesses insured and personal lines individuals insured segments  less the costs of underwriting the insurance policies  the costs of settling and paying claims reported on the policies  and from investment income reduced by investment expenses  and from gains or losses on holdings in our investment portfolio 
variability in our income is caused by a variety of circumstances  some within the control of our companies and some not within their control 
premium volume is affected by  among other things  the availability of quality  properly priced underwriting risks being produced by our agents  the ability to retain on renewal existing good performing accounts  competition from other insurance companies  regulatory rate approvals  our reputation  and other limitations created by the marketplace or regulators 
our underwriting costs are affected by  among other things  the amount of commission and profit sharing we pay our agents to produce the underwriting risks we receive premiums for  the cost of issuing insurance policies and maintaining our customer and agent relationships  marketing costs  taxes we pay to the states we operate in on the amount of premium we collect  and other assessments and charges imposed on our companies by the regulators in the states in which we do business 
our claim and claim settlement costs are affected by  among other things  the quality of our underwriting accounts  severe weather in our operating region  the nature of the claim  the 
table of contents regulatory and legal environment in our territories  inflation in underlying medical and property repair costs  and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
our investment income and realized gains and losses are determined by  among other things  market forces  the rates of interest and dividends paid on our portfolio holdings  the credit or investment quality of the issuer and the success of its underlying business  the market perception of the company invested in  and other factors such as ratings by rating agencies and analysts 
critical accounting policies general we are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims that have not yet been reported to our insurance companies 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss adjustment expenses are determined using historical information by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is ordinarily implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results over multiple years 
reserves are closely monitored and are recomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques 
specifically  on a quarterly basis  we review  by line of business  existing reserves  new claims  changes to existing case reserves  and paid losses with respect to the current and prior accident years 
we use historical paid and incurred losses and accident year data to derive expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense ratios by line of business 
we then apply these expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to earned premium to derive a reserve level for each line of business 
in connection with the determination of the reserves  we also consider other specific factors such as recent weather related losses  trends in historical paid losses  and legal and judicial trends with respect to theories of liability 
some of our business relates to coverage for short term risks  and for these risks loss development is comparatively rapid and historical paid losses  adjusted for known variables  have been a reliable predictive measure of future losses for purposes of our reserving 
some of our business relates to longer term risks  where the claims are slower to emerge and the estimate of damage is more difficult to predict 
for these lines of business  more sophisticated actuarial methods  such as the bornhuetter ferguson loss development methods see methods below must be employed to project an ultimate loss expectation  and then the related loss history must be regularly evaluated and loss expectations updated  with the possibility of variability from the initial estimate of ultimate losses 
a substantial portion of the business of our recent acquisition  financial pacific insurance company  is this type of longer tailed casualty business 
when a claim is reported to us  our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator 
the individual estimating the reserve considers the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are adjusted by our claims staff as more information becomes available 
it is our policy to settle each claim as expeditiously as possible 

table of contents we maintain ibnr reserves to provide for already incurred claims that have not yet been reported and developments on reported claims 
the ibnr reserve is determined by estimating our insurance companies ultimate net liability for both reported and ibnr claims and then subtracting the case reserves and payments made to date for reported claims 
methods used to estimate loss loss adjustment expense reserves we applied the following general methods in projecting loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the group paid loss development paid bornhuetter ferguson loss development reported loss development reported bornhuetter ferguson loss development description of ultimate loss estimation methods the reported loss development method relies on the assumption that  at any given state of maturity  ultimate losses can be predicted by multiplying cumulative reported losses paid losses plus case reserves by a cumulative development factor 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates  as well as the consistency of case reserve levels 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at all stages of maturity 
historical age to age loss development factors were calculated to measure the relative development of an accident year from one maturity point to the next 
we then selected appropriate age to age loss development factors based on these historical factors and used the selected factors to project the ultimate losses 
the paid loss development method is mechanically identical to the incurred loss development method described above 
the paid method does not rely on case reserves or claim reporting patterns in making projections 
the validity of the results from using a loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  a shift between single and multiple claim payments  legal changes  or variations in a company s mix of business from year to year 
also  since the percentage of losses paid for immature years is often low  development factors are volatile 
a small variation in the number of claims paid can have a leveraging effect that can lead to significant changes in estimated ultimates 
therefore  ultimate values for immature accident years are often based on alternative estimation techniques 
the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on reported loss data relies on the assumption that remaining unreported losses are a function of the total expected losses rather than a function of currently reported losses 
the expected losses used in this analysis were selected judgmentally 
the expected losses are multiplied by the unreported percentage to produce expected unreported losses 
the unreported percentage is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the selected incurred loss development factors 
finally  the expected unreported losses are added to the current reported losses to produce ultimate losses 
the calculations underlying the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on paid loss data are similar to the incurred bornhuetter ferguson calculations with the exception that paid losses and unpaid percentages replace reported losses and unreported percentages 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is most useful as an alternative to other models for immature accident years 
for these immature years  the amounts reported or paid may be small and unstable and therefore not predictive of future development 
therefore  future development is assumed to follow an expected pattern that is supported by more stable historical data or by emerging trends 
this method is also useful when changing reporting patterns or payment patterns distort the historical development of losses 

table of contents for the property lines of business special property  personal auto physical  commercial auto physical damage the results of the reserve calculations were similar and we relied on an average of the four methods utilized 
for the homeowners and commercial multi peril lines of business excluding california cmp business for policy years and prior we relied on the incurred loss development and incurred bornhuetter ferguson methods in estimating loss reserves 
these two methods yield more consistent results although the two paid methods yielded reserves that were similar in total to the incurred methods 
in july of  the california supreme court rendered its opinion of admiral insurance company vs 
montrose chemical corporation the montrose decision 
in that decision  the supreme court ruled that in the case of a continuous and progressively deteriorating loss  such as pollution liability or construction defect liability  an insurance company has a definitive duty to defend the policyholder until all uncertainty related to the severity and cause of the loss is extinguished 
as a result of the montrose decision  financial pacific insurance company a subsidiary of the group since october  experienced a significant increase in construction defect liability cases  to which it would not have been subject under the old interpretation of the law 
in response  financial pacific implemented a series of underwriting measures to limit the prospective exposure to montrose and construction defect liability 
these changes to coverage and risk selection resulted in a marked improvement in the post montrose underwriting results 
financial pacific evaluates commercial multi peril liability reserves by segregating pre and post montrose activity as well as segregating contractors versus non contractor experience 
an inception to date ground up incurred loss database was created as the basis for this new analysis 
the pre montrose activity is evaluated on a report year basis which eliminates the accident year development distortions caused by the effects of the montrose decision 
for policy years and later  the reserves are analyzed using the more traditional accident year analysis 
for the liability lines general liability  personal auto liability  commercial auto liability  workers compensation the paid loss development method yielded less than reliable results for the immature years and we did not use the method in selecting ultimate losses and reserves 
for these lines we relied on the incurred bornhuetter ferguson method for the most recent accident years and both of the incurred loss development methods for the remaining years 
the property and casualty industry has incurred substantial aggregate losses from claims related to asbestos related illnesses  environmental remediation  product and mold  and other uncertain or environmental exposures 
we have not experienced significant losses from these types of claims 
each quarter  we compute our estimated ultimate liability using these principles and procedures applicable to the lines of business written 
however  because the establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
changes in estimates  or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid  are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made 
reserves are estimates because there are uncertainties inherent in the determination of ultimate losses 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past as well as create uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends 
accordingly  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  the table below summarizes the effect on net loss reserves and surplus in the event of reasonably likely changes in the variables considered in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the range of reasonably likely changes was established based on a review of changes in accident year development by line of

management s point estimate of reserves is at the higher end of its actuarially determined range in recognition of the inherent challenge in assessing the potential ultimate liabilities given legal developments as well as the evolution in its operations 
the evolution in its operations include such things as changes in coverage and pricing in response to market opportunity as well as higher reinsurance retentions and geographic and product diversification all of which affect management s reserve estimates

a decline in fair value of an investment below its cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings as a realized loss 
we monitor our investment portfolio and review investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
these evaluations involve judgment and consider the magnitude and reasons for a decline and the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term 
in the years ended december   and  we recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of   and  respectively 
in  these charges related to preferred stocks and fixed income securities  and in and these charges are primarily with respect to equity securities that we determined were other than temporarily impaired 
adverse investment market conditions  poor operating performance  or other adversity encountered by companies whose stock or fixed maturity securities we own could result in impairment charges in the future 
the company s policy on impairment of value of investments is as follows if a security has a market value below cost it is considered impaired 
for any such security a review of the financial condition and prospects of the company will be performed by the investment committee to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
if it is determined that the decline in market value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security will be written down to realizable value and the amount of the write down accounted for as a realized loss 
realizable value is defined for this purpose as the market price of the security 
write down to a value other than the market price requires objective evidence in support of that value 
in evaluating the potential impairment of fixed income securities  the investment committee will evaluate relevant factors  including but not limited to the following the issuer s current financial condition and ability to make future scheduled principal and interest payments  relevant rating history  analysis and guidance provided by rating agencies and analysts  the degree to which an issuer is current or in arrears in making principal and interest payments  and changes in price relative to the market 
in evaluating the potential impairment of equity securities  the investment committee will evaluate certain factors  including but not limited to the following the relationship of market price per share versus carrying value per share at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  the price to earnings ratio at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  any rating agency announcements  the issuer s financial 
table of contents condition and near term prospects  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  the independent auditor s report on the issuer s financial statements  and any buy sell hold recommendations or price projections by outside investment advisors 
we have one significant non traded equity security  a non voting common stock in excess reinsurance company  which is carried at million 
excess reinsurance company paid a special dividend to the group in and in the amount of  and  respectively 
its fair value is estimated at the statutory book value as reported to the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
other non traded securities  which are not material in the aggregate  are carried at cost 
policy acquisition costs we defer policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business 
these costs are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  loss and loss adjustment expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  may require acceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
reinsurance amounts recoverable from property and casualty reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy 
amounts paid for reinsurance contracts are expensed over the contract period during which insured events are covered by the reinsurance contracts 
ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reported separately as assets  instead of being netted with the related liabilities  because reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders 
reinsurance balances recoverable are subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
additionally  the same uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses affect the estimates for the ceded portion of these liabilities 
we continually monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers 
many of the company s reinsurance treaties contain provisions that establish minimum and maximum cessions and allow limited participation in the profit of the ceded business 
generally  the company shares on a limited basis in the profitability of our reinsurance treaties through contingent ceding commissions 
the company s exposure in the loss experience is contractually defined at minimum and maximum levels 
the terms of such contracts are fixed at inception 
since estimating the emergence of claims to the applicable reinsurance layers is subject to significant uncertainty  the net amounts that will ultimately be realized may vary significantly from the estimated amounts presented in the company s results of operations 
as of december   million is due from alea north america insurance company alea  which previously was rated a excellent  but presently is rated nr not rated by company request 
alea group  the parent of alea is now in voluntary runoff 
some of the company s treaties with alea have contractual provisions that require a trust account to be set up in the event of downgrade 
management is currently working with alea through its reinsurance intermediary to have alea fund such a trust  which would cover million of the million of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to alea as of december  additionally  to further limit its exposure  the company terminated its policy year treaties with alea on a cut off basis 
at the present time  alea remains current in the payment of its obligations to the company 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date 
results of operations our results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general 
the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition  weather  catastrophic events  regulation  general economic conditions  judicial trends  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment 
revenue and income by segment is as follows for the years ended december   and december in thousands revenues net premiums earned commercial lines personal lines total net premiums earned net investment income realized investment gains other total revenues income before income taxes underwriting income loss commercial lines personal lines total underwriting income loss net investment income realized investment gains other income before income taxes and minority interest in income of subsidiary our growth in premiums and underwriting results has been  and continue to be  influenced by market conditions  as well as the acquisition of financial pacific on october  pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been and remains cyclical 
during a soft market cycle  price competition is prevalent  which makes it difficult to write and retain properly priced personal and commercial lines business 
our policy is to maintain disciplined underwriting and pricing standards during soft markets  declining business which is inadequately priced for its level of risk 
the hard market and related pricing power of the early part of the current decade has given way to a much more competitive market recently  particularly in large commercial accounts  package policies and in the pennsylvania personal auto market 
this has resulted in slower premium growth than the company has achieved in recent years 

table of contents the availability of reinsurance at reasonable pricing is an important part of our business 
the recent surge in catastrophic activity  particularly along the gulf coast  has placed reinsurers under greater financial pressures than experienced in recent years  and this has been reflected in their underwriting appetite  reinsurance terms  and to some degree  their rates 
our operating territories and the group s claim activity experienced only a minor impact from the residual effects of the hurricanes that ravaged the gulf coast  and this was helpful in keeping our reinsurance program in place and without significant rate change on renewal 
on june   the group acquired of franklin holding and thereafter consolidated the financial condition and results of operations of franklin holding with mercer insurance company 
from acquisition through december   we allocated a portion of franklin holding s net income to the minority interest in franklin holding 
this resulted in an allocation of income to minority interest of  for the year ended december  the minority interest in franklin holding was acquired by the company immediately after the conversion  through an exchange of shares 
since franklin holding company  inc became wholly owned within the group in december   no further income has been allocated to the minority interest 
on october   the group acquired financial pacific insurance group  inc  including its insurance subsidiary  financial pacific insurance company 
financial pacific underwrites commercial lines of business  principally in the states of california  arizona  nevada and oregon 
thus  the financial statements for the year ended december  include financial pacific insurance group  inc and its results of operations from october  through december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  the components of income for and  and the change and percentage change from year to year  are shown in the charts below

our personal lines underwriting performance in is significantly better than the prior year 
this improved performance has been driven by the absence in of the severe weather which occurred in our operating territories in the first quarter of  during which the company had a significantly higher number of claims in personal lines 
the commercial lines performance was also very good in  despite a number of larger losses in the second and third quarters 
the number of new claims in was on the low side of the 
table of contents normal range of expectations  and more favorable than the prior year  and large losses in the aggregate were within the normal range of expectations 
the company s gaap combined ratio declined in from to  and the statutory combined ratio improved to in from in net investment income increased to million  primarily as a result of increased yields on short term investments held in the fixed income investment portfolio and the acquisition of financial pacific and its net investment income 
realized investment gains amounted to million in  compared to a gain of  in  with the higher level of realized gains in attributable to the disposition of securities in anticipation of funding the acquisition of financial pacific  inc on october   for million in cash excluding acquisition costs

vs 
revenue change change direct premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned net investment income realized investment gains other revenue total revenue total revenues for were up  or million  over revenues to million 
this increase was due primarily to inclusion of the revenue of financial pacific since its acquisition  which added million of revenue  or percentage points of the increase in revenue in net premiums earned increased  or million  to million  with percentage points  or million of the increase  relating to the inclusion of financial pacific in the group s results 
in  net investment income increased to million  driven by higher short term interest rates  and the inclusion of financial pacific s net investment income since acquisition  which added million  or percentage points of the increase 
realized gains increased in connection with sales of mostly equity securities to fund the financial pacific acquisition 
realized gains also included in a gain of  relating to the mark to market fair value adjustment on interest rate swaps related to the floating rate trust preferred securities 
in  direct premiums written increased over to million from million  or million 
inclusion of financial pacific since its acquisition by the group added million in direct written premium  with the balance of the change attributable to a modest decline in personal lines premium as that book continues to be re directed  and more competitive pricing in the commercial lines marketplace

table of contents n m means not meaningful in  net investment income increased million  or 
although our investment income benefited in from higher short term interest rates  the majority of the increase  million  or percentage points of the increase  was attributable to the inclusion of the net investment income of financial pacific since its acquisition by the group 
investment income on fixed income securities was up million  or 
the increase included million  or percentage points of the increase  as a result of the inclusion of the investment income of financial pacific since acquisition 
a much larger proportion  as compared to the group s business before the acquisition  of financial pacific s premiums written relate to casualty  or longer tail  business 
by its nature  longer tail business requires more time for losses to manifest themselves  with the result that claims tend to be paid later on casualty claims than on other types of claims 
the later payment of claims associated with casualty reserves provides a company with the opportunity to use the funds which will ultimately be paid out as claims for a longer period of time  thus generating a larger relative portfolio of fixed income securities and higher investment income 
accordingly  the inclusion of financial pacific s investment income on fixed income securities had a significant impact on the group s gross investment income in  and since october   when financial pacific was acquired 
it is expected that a similar impact on gross investment income will be present in quarter on quarter comparisons until financial pacific has been included in the group s operations for four quarters 
in implementing the investment policy guidelines and directions of the investment committee of the board of directors  the fixed income securities managers during changed the composition of the fixed income securities portfolio to be more heavily weighted in tax exempt securities  industrial and miscellaneous fixed income securities  and mortgage backed securities  and less heavily weighted towards u 
s government and government agencies fixed income securities  with a goal of increasing yields while continuing to maintain high credit qualities 
dividend income in was down  or from the decrease was caused by the sale of some equity securities during in order to fund the financial pacific acquisition  and also because the group received a special dividend of  in on its investment in excess reinsurance company  as compared to  in interest on cash and cash equivalents in increased  or  to  this increase is attributable to higher short term rates in  as well as the fact that the group generated million of funds to invest as a result of its demutualization on december  given a difficult interest rate environment and fixed income securities market at the time  these funds were not largely invested until the second quarter of  and  consequently  a portion of them earned a short term yield during much of the first six months of that was considerably lower than similar yields in in addition  in accumulating funds for the closing of the acquisition of financial pacific  proceeds from the sale of securities were invested in short term instruments  and generated interest on cash equivalents 
investment expenses increased in  or  to million 
this increase is largely attributable to the inclusion of financial pacific since its acquisition 
net realized gains for were million  as compared to  in as noted above  these gains were taken as part of the process of funding the acquisition of financial pacific insurance group 
in  net realized investment gains of million included gains on securities sales of million  offset by losses on securities sales of million 
the losses from securities sales were comprised of  from the sale of fixed income securities   from the sale of equities  and  from the writedown of securities determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
these securities were written down to our estimate of fair market value at the time of the writedown 
the company has entered into five interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate risk on its floating rate trust preferred securities 
for the quarter and year ended december   the company s net realized gain on the interest rate swap agreements was

in an unusual situation impacting both direct and net written premium  the group had a large master account with a premium of approximately million  which was originally written on a thirteen month policy in december  renew in january  although the earned premium relating to this policy in is reported in the net premium earned above  it is not reflected in the direct and net written premium above because of its renewal date in our premiums earned growth reflects the company s focus on growing the commercial lines book  while working within our underwriting standards 
growth rates in our commercial lines direct premiums written have declined recently as compared to previous years  due to a more competitive marketplace 
some of our classes of business  consisting generally of the larger accounts  are more sensitive to competition than others 
competitive pressures tend to be more moderate for our smaller accounts  with a higher retention rate and less pressure on the renewal premium 
we continually work with our agents to target classes of business and accounts compatible with our underwriting appetite  which includes certain types of religious institution risks  small business risks and property risks 
in the commercial lines segment for  we had underwriting income of million  a gaap combined ratio of  a gaap loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of and a gaap underwriting expense ratio of  compared to an underwriting gain of million  a gaap combined ratio of  a gaap loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of and an underwriting expense ratio of for the same period in our commercial lines loss ratio for has been adversely affected by a modestly higher amount of large property and casualty losses as compared to  however the volume of new claims in is generally favorable 
in addition  financial pacific s commercial lines tend to operate with higher loss ratios and lower expense ratios than the group s commercial lines business prior to the acquisition of financial pacific  and so it is expected that a similar impact on commercial lines loss and expense ratios will be observed in quarter on quarter comparisons until financial pacific has been included in the group s operations for four quarters 
direct commercial multi peril premiums written  the largest component of our commercial lines segment  nearly doubled to million in  compared to million for  and net commercial multi peril premiums earned increased by to million in  compared to million for a substantial portion of the increase is as a result of the financial pacific acquisition 
excluding the policy count added by the acquisition of financial pacific  the group s largest increase in policy count was within our religious institutions sector  where our increasing market presence is helping us add new premium  and in our special contractors sector 
we expect this trend of increasing commercial writings to continue by targeting selected types of risks with selected producers 
the financial pacific book focuses on targeted classes of business 
one of the targeted classes  contractors commercial liability  generates premium currently representing approximately of financial 
table of contents pacific s book of business 
while this class remains an important component  the company is actively working to diversify its book of business by increasing production in other target programs  as well as leveraging our existing contractors liability book to add additional coverages such as commercial auto and commercial property

the personal lines performance in was affected by a significantly lower frequency of losses and by a lower severity of losses as compared to the losses were significantly higher than usual  and were attributable to harsh weather conditions which resulted in a high number of losses from frozen pipes  structural collapses  more frequent automobile losses and accidents  and other losses of the type caused by an extended period of harsh weather 
besides the improved loss frequency resulting from the more moderate weather in  the personal lines book benefited from the underwriting initiatives undertaken in both the homeowners and pennsylvania personal automobile lines in the last two years 
these initiatives included the reclassification of certain homeowners risks from our preferred program to our standard program  resulting in a higher premium  as well as modified underwriting standards relating to the types of pennsylvania personal automobile risks the company will write 
the company implemented a rate increase for the homeowners line in new jersey on july   and has achieved an overall average rate increase of approximately 
the impact of the company s underwriting initiatives in its pennsylvania personal automobile line has resulted in lower direct premium written  as contraction in the number of policies in certain tiers has occurred more quickly than premium expansion in the targeted tiers 
the direct loss ratio for our pennsylvania personal automobile book has improved  however  as our targeted tiers have become a proportionately larger part of our book 
although the company expects to continue growing its personal lines book  it will continue to devote greater focus to growth in the commercial lines book

the company maintains various agency profit sharing plans  which  in addition to base commissions  annually reward agents for the growth and profitability of the business they produce while representing the company 
the additional commission is computed only on the aggregate growth and profitability of the book of business the agent produces each year 
the company does not have any marketing services agreements  placement services agreements  or similar arrangements 
we are currently in the process of converting our information system  which is targeted for completion in the latter half of when completed  we expect some costs to moderate as implementation costs and costs associated with operating dual systems end 
these reduced costs will be offset by some higher staffing costs  but we also should be positioned to expand premium volume in the near term without material incremental expense because of increased processing capacity 
in the third quarter of  we began renewing most of our new jersey policies in our mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc subsidiary  thus eliminating the company s liability for retaliatory premium taxes

also impacting the company s income in was the cost of being a public company  which adversely impacted both net income and the gaap underwriting expense ratio  and  to a lesser extent  the statutory underwriting expense ratio 
net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred increased in overall by only  or  to million  reflecting lower claims frequency in over  despite growth in exposures in as our net premium earned grew by

our insurance companies maintain investment and reinsurance programs that are intended to provide sufficient funds to meet their obligations without forced sales of investments

the principal source of liquidity for mercer insurance group  inc which has modest expenses and does not currently  or for the foreseeable future  need a significant regular source of cash flow to cover these expenses has  up to the financial pacific acquisition  been the net proceeds it retained from the conversion stock offering  as well as dividend payments and other fees received from mercer insurance company or other subsidiaries  and payments it receives on the year note it received from the esop see below when the esop purchased shares at the time of the conversion 

table of contents for a period of three years after the conversion which took place on december   mercer insurance company may not declare or pay any dividend to mercer insurance group without the approval of the pennsylvania insurance department 
after this three year period  mercer insurance company will be limited by the insurance laws of pennsylvania as to the amount of dividends or other distributions it may pay to its holding company 
under pennsylvania law  there is a maximum amount that may be paid by mercer insurance company during any twelve month period after notice to  but without prior approval of  the pennsylvania insurance department 
this limit is the greater of of mercer insurance company s statutory surplus as reported on its most recent annual statement filed with the pennsylvania insurance department  or the net income of mercer insurance company for the period covered by such annual statement 
similarly  financial pacific is limited by the insurance laws of california as to how much it may issue as dividends to mercer insurance group  using a formula similar to that described for pennsylvania 
if the dividend restrictions imposed on mercer insurance company related to the conversion were not in effect  then as of december   the amounts available for payment of dividends from mercer insurance company in  without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department would have been approximately million 
prior to its payment of any dividends  mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc is required to provide notice of the intended dividends to the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
new jersey law sets the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid  which amount cannot exceed the greater of of mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc s statutory surplus as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with new jersey  or the net income  not including realized capital gains  for the period covered by the annual statement 
the new jersey department has the power to limit or prohibit dividend payments if certain conditions exist 
these restrictions or any subsequently imposed restrictions may affect our future liquidity 
as of december   the amount available for payment of dividends by mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc to mercer insurance company in without the prior approval of new jersey department of banking and insurance is approximately million 
as a pennsylvania domiciled insurance company  dividends payable by franklin insurance company are subject to the same formula limitation described above for mercer insurance company

in connection with the acquisition of financial pacific insurance group for approximately million in cash on october   all of the securities of mercer insurance group  inc which were purchased with proceeds of the conversion were converted into cash  with all but approximately  of this balance used to fund the acquisition 
the remaining liquid assets in mercer insurance group  as well as its other sources of revenue  are adequate to fund its current expenses for the foreseeable future 
as part of the funding of the acquisition  mercer insurance company  with the approval of the pennsylvania department of insurance  paid an extraordinary dividend of million on september   to mercer insurance group  inc mercer insurance company also entered into a loan agreement with mercer insurance group  inc  by which it advanced on september   a loan of million with a year note and a fixed interest rate of  repayable in equal annual installments 
after the acquisition  mercer insurance group has no special limitations on its ability to take periodic dividends from financial pacific insurance group  but financial pacific insurance group will be subject to normal dividend restrictions administered by the california department of insurance similar to those described above for mercer insurance company  and by a covenant in financial pacific s line of credit that prohibits dividends while that facility is in use 
the company believes that the resources available to mercer insurance group  inc  will be adequate for it to meet its obligation under the note to mercer insurance company and its other expenses

it is anticipated that approximately of the original esop shares will be allocated annually to employee participants of the esop 
an expense charge is booked ratably during each year for the shares committed to be allocated to participants that year  determined with reference to the fair market value of the company s stock at the time the commitment to allocate the shares is accrued and recognized 
the issuance of the shares to the esop was fully recognized in the additional paid in capital account at conversion  with a contra account entitled unearned esop shares established in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet for the unallocated shares at an amount equal to their original per share purchase price 
mercer insurance group  inc adopted a stock based incentive plan at its annual meeting of shareholders 
pursuant to that plan  mercer insurance group may issue a total of  shares  which amount will increase automatically each year by of the number of shares outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
at december   the shares authorized under the plan has been increased under this provision to  shares 
the fair market value of any common stock used for restricted stock awards initially is classified as unearned compensation  and is then amortized ratably against earnings 
as mercer insurance group accrues compensation expense to reflect the vesting of such shares  unearned compensation is reduced accordingly 
this compensation expense is deductible for federal income tax purposes upon vesting under current law 
during  the company made grants of  shares of restricted stock  grants of  incentive stock options  and grants of  non qualified stock options 
as of september    shares of restricted stock and  stock options were forfeited  and  shares of restricted stock and  incentive stock options were granted 
additional grants of  shares of restricted stock   incentive stock options  and  non qualified options were made after september  to individuals employed by financial pacific insurance group in connection with its acquisition on october  by mercer insurance group 
on october   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  additional shares of its common stock in addition to the  share repurchase authorized june  and previously completed 
the repurchase of the additional  shares was completed on march  the repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares available for issuance in connection with mercer 
table of contents insurance group s stock incentive plan 
in the aggregate   shares have been repurchased since the conversion  at an aggregate cost of million  or per share  with purchases totaling million  or per share 
in addition   shares of stock were repurchased from employees in order to pay the required tax withholdings on the first vesting of restricted stock under the stock incentive plan 
in connection with a continuing retaliatory tax controversy  in and the company paid an aggregate of million  plus interest  to the new jersey division of taxation the division in retaliatory tax 
the retaliatory tax generally is imposed on foreign insurers when the foreign company s home state ie  its state of incorporation or domicile has a higher rate of premium tax than the state imposing the tax  in this case new jersey 
the payments were made in response to notices of deficiency issued by the division to the company 
in conjunction with making such payments  the company filed notices of protest with the division with respect to the retaliatory tax imposed 
the basis for the protests was that the division s imposition of the retaliatory tax was unconstitutional and based on an incorrect interpretation of the law which denied the company the ability to take advantage of new jersey s premium tax cap  which limits the premiums tax to the lesser of the company s new jersey premiums or percent of the company s total premiums received from both new jersey and out of state policyholders 
the protests currently are pending with the division s conferences and appeals branch 
concurrent with the processing of the company s protests of the retaliatory tax  other foreign insurers have been litigating virtually identical issues in new jersey courts 
on march   the appellate division of the new jersey superior court reversed a decision of the new jersey tax court that had sustained the division s imposition of the retaliatory tax against a foreign insurer 
the division has since appealed the decision of the appellate division to the new jersey supreme court  which has agreed to hear the case 
the company expects that the division s ruling on the company s protest will be based on the ultimate resolution of the case now being appealed to the new jersey supreme court 
the new jersey supreme court has heard oral arguments  and currently has the case under consideration 
it is not known how the new jersey supreme court will rule in this case  and therefore the company is unable to determine whether all  or any portion  of the retaliatory tax will be refunded 
any such refund would be reduced by related federal income tax 
due to the contingencies involved  the company has not accrued any refund of the retaliatory tax 
impact of inflation inflation increases consumers needs for property and casualty insurance coverage 
inflation also increases claims incurred by property and casualty insurers as property repairs  replacements and medical expenses increase 
these cost increases reduce profit margins to the extent that rate increases are not implemented on an adequate and timely basis 
we establish property and casualty insurance premiums levels before the amount of losses and loss expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect these expenses  are known 
therefore  our insurance companies attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation when establishing rates 
because inflation has remained relatively low in recent years  financial results have not been significantly affected by inflation 
inflation also often results in increases in the general level of interest rates  and  consequently  generally results in increased levels of investment income derived from our investments portfolio 
off balance sheet commitments and contractual obligations the company was not a party to any unconsolidated arrangement or financial instrument with special purpose entities or other vehicles at december  which would give rise to previously undisclosed market  credit or financing risk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have exposure to three principal types of market risk through our investment activities interest rate risk  credit risk and equity risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for hedging  trading or speculative purposes  other than the interest rate swap agreements that hedge the floating rate trust preferred securities which were assumed as part of the financial pacific acquisition on october  interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as of december   the average maturity of our fixed income investment portfolio excluding mortgage backed securities was years 
our fixed maturity investments include us government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates 
we carry these investments as available for sale 
this allows us to manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and board of directors and consultation with our financial advisor 
fluctuations in near term interest rates could have an impact on the results of operations and cash flows 
certain of these fixed income securities have call features 
in a declining interest rate environment  these securities may be called by their issuer and replaced with securities bearing lower interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  we may sell these securities rather than holding to maturity and receive less than we paid for them 
as a general matter  we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities 
our goal is to maximize the total return on all of our investments 
an important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer term investments to pay claims
