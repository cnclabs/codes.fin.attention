item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reflects our historical results of operations  which do not include results from the remaining interest in hawesville until acquired in april  our ownership of nordural until acquired in late april  and  our ownership interest in the gramercy assets until acquired in october accordingly  the results for fiscal years and are not fully comparable to the results of operations for fiscal year our historical results are not indicative of our current business 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
overview we produce primary aluminum 
the aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by global supply and demand 
the key determinants of our results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows our selling price is based on the lme price of primary aluminum and fixed price sales contracts 
our facilities operate at or near capacity  and fluctuations in volume  other than through acquisitions  generally are small 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are alumina  power and labor  which in aggregate were in excess of of the cost of goods sold 
many of these costs are covered by long term contracts  as described below 
average realized price and cost of goods sold per pound shipped are our key performance indicators 
revenue varies significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in the lme and midwest price of aluminum 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
revenue is also impacted by our hedging activities 
fluctuations in working capital are influenced by the lme and midwest price of primary aluminum and by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements from major customers and suppliers 
cost of goods sold  excluding alumina and energy costs  is expected to remain relatively stable because our plants operate near capacity and our major cost drivers are covered by long term contracts 
fluctuations in the cost of alumina are expected as the pricing in these contracts is variable and  except for the gramercy alumina contract  based on lme prices 
the long term success of our us facilities will depend on our ability to operate these facilities at planned capacity and to obtain or renegotiate long term power  alumina  and labor contracts at economic rates 
our long term alumina contracts for ravenswood and a portion of mt 
holly s requirements expire at the end of given the tightening of supply in the alumina market  we expect our alumina costs to increase 
power contracts for our us facilities provide for primarily fixed priced power through  subject to adjustments for fuel costs for mt 
holly the power costs at mt 
holly were million higher in than  primarily due to fuel cost adjustments  and a possible adjustment arising out of a rate case for ravenswood 
hawesville s unpriced power increases to mw in through we are currently reviewing our options for the unpriced power 
we expect rates for the unpriced power to be significantly higher than the rates paid under our current long term power contracts 
power contract pricing for nordural is variable and based on lme prices 
labor agreements with the united steelworkers of america at our hawesville and ravenswood facilities expire in through our ownership of ravenswood  hawesville and nordural  and our ownership interest in mt 
holly  we have an annual rated production capacity of approximately  metric tons of primary aluminum 
our annual production capacity should increase to  metric tons by the fourth quarter of with possible further increase to  metric tons by the end of as a result of expansions at nordural 
recent developments alumina supply contract with trafigura on march   century entered into a long term alumina supply contract with trafigura for the supply of alumina 
trafigura will supply approximately  metric tons per year of alumina beginning january   increasing to  metric tons after january the contract pricing will be variable  based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
hawesville electrical power supply agreements on february   century signed an agreement with kenergy for the supply of a substantial portion of the remaining unpriced power requirements of hawesville through  at fixed prices 
approximately or mw of hawesville s power requirements though will be priced at variable market rates 
on december   we signed a memorandum of understanding with big rivers electric corporation and kenergy corporation anticipating that the parties would negotiate a contract to replace the current power supply service agreement that provides power to hawesville 
the proposed new agreement  if completed  would restructure and extend the existing power supply contract from through the nordural expansion the start up of nordural s expansion capacity began in february we expect to reach full production capacity of  metric tons annual production by the fourth quarter of the expansion is expected to cost approximately million 
in connection with the expansion  we amended several long term contracts with the government of iceland  local municipalities and the faxafloahafnir sf 
we amended the billiton tolling agreement  increasing the volume to  metric tons per year effective upon completion of the expansion 
we have also agreed to an lme based year alumina tolling contract with glencore for  metric tons of the expansion capacity  effective upon the completion of the expansion 
power for the expansion capacity will be purchased under a long term lme based agreement with hitaveita sudurnesja hf 
hs and orkuveita reykjav kur or 
following completion of the expansion  nordural will have all the infrastructure and support facilities necessary for further expansion to  metric tons of annual production capacity 
or has agreed to deliver power that will allow the further expansion to  metric tons by late we are considering various options for financing the additional capacity 
icelandic greenfield joint action plan on november   we announced that nordural signed a joint action plan with the reykjanesbaer municipality  the invest in iceland agency  which is owned by the ministry of industry and commerce and the trade council of iceland  to further evaluate the possible construction of a new aluminum smelter in the vicinity of helguvik  approximately miles from the city of reykjavik 
the joint action plan will focus on the development of an industrial site  securing power generation and transmission  satisfying environmental regulations and meeting other regulatory and administrative requirements 
the joint action plan is scheduled for completion no later than july million revolving credit facility on september   we entered into a new five year million senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lending institutions 
the new credit facility replaced our previous million senior secured revolving credit 
new directors and officers on january   our board of directors the board elected jarl berntzen to serve as a member of the board effective march  on january   we announced that michael a 
bless would succeed david w 
beckley as executive vice president and chief financial officer of the company upon mr 
beckley s retirement on january  on december   logan w 
kruger was appointed president and chief executive officer  succeeding craig a 
davis who retired effective december  mr 
davis continues to serve as the chairman of our board 
key long term contracts primary aluminum sales contracts we routinely enter into market priced contracts for the sale of primary aluminum 
a summary of century s long term primary aluminum sales contracts is provided below 
contract customer volume term pricing alcan metal agreement alcan to million pounds per year through july  variable  based on us midwest market glencore metal agreement i glencore  metric tons per year january through december  variable  lme based glencore metal agreement ii glencore  metric tons per year january through december  variable  based on us midwest market southwire metal agreement southwire million pounds per year high purity molten aluminum through march  variable  based on us midwest market million pounds per year standard grade molten aluminum through december  variable  based on us midwest market alcan has the right  upon months notice  to reduce its purchase obligations by under this contract 
we account for the glencore metal agreement i as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
we have not designated the glencore metal agreement i as normal because it replaced and substituted for a significant portion of a sales contract which did not qualify for this designation 
because the glencore metal agreement i is variably priced  we do not expect significant variability in its fair value  other than changes that might result from the absence of the us midwest premium 
we account for the glencore metal agreement ii as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
under the glencore metal agreement ii  pricing is based on then current market prices  adjusted by a negotiated us midwest premium with a cap and a floor as applied to the current us midwest premium 
the southwire metal agreement will automatically renew for additional five year terms  unless either party provides months notice that it has elected not to renew 
tolling contracts contract customer volume term pricing billiton tolling agreement bhp billiton  mtpy through december lme based glencore tolling agreement glencore  mtpy through july lme based substantially all of nordural s existing sales consist of tolling revenues earned under a long term alumina supply  toll conversion and aluminum metal supply agreement the billiton tolling agreement between nordural and a subsidiary of bhp billiton ltd together with its subsidiaries  bhp billiton 
under the billiton tolling agreement  nordural receives an lme based fee for the conversion of alumina  supplied by bhp billiton  into primary aluminum 
in september  nordural and bhp billiton amended the billiton tolling agreement to increase the tolling arrangement from  metric tons to  metric tons of the per annum production capacity at nordural effective upon the completion of the expansion 
nordural entered into a year lme based alumina tolling agreement with glencore for  metric tons of the expansion capacity at nordural 
the term of the agreement is expected to begin july in december  glencore assigned to hydro of its tolling rights under this agreement for the period to nordural consented to the assignment 
key long term supply agreements alumina supply agreements we are party to long term supply agreements with glencore that supply a fixed quantity of alumina to our ravenswood and mt 
holly facilities at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum quoted on the lme 
we recently entered into a long term supply agreement with trafigura to supply alumina beginning in we are party to a long term supply agreement with gramercy alumina llc that supplies a fixed quantity of alumina to hawesville at prices based on the alumina production costs at the gramercy refinery

power under the new agreement is priced under an appalachian power tariff 
appalachian power company filed a rate case on september   seeking increases in its tariff rates 
it has advised century it expects those rates to become effective july  we intend to contest the rate increase 
in connection with the expansion of nordural  nordural entered into contracts with hitaveita sudurnesja hf 
and orkuveita reykjav kur for the supply of the power required for  metric tons of the expansion capacity 
nordural may purchase additional electrical power under one of those contracts to support the further expansion of the facility 
the rate for the power supplied under both contracts is lme based 
labor agreements our labor costs at ravenswood and hawesville are subject to the terms of labor contracts which generally have provisions for annual fixed increases in hourly wages and benefits adjustments 
the six labor unions represented at nordural operate under a labor contract that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees 
the employees at mt 
holly are employed by alcoa and are not unionized 
a summary of key labor agreements is provided below

ann jamaican labor unions through december  the nordural union employees approved the current labor contract in april the contract s provisions  including wage increases and increases in pension payments  were retroactive to january  st 
ann has two labor unions  the university and allied workers union the uawu and a smaller union covering certain salaried employees 
st 
ann renegotiated the uawu labor contracts in and the labor agreement will expire on april  on february   the salaried employees labor union agreed to a labor contract that will expire on december  application of critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires that management make subjective estimates  assumptions and judgments in applying these accounting policies 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events 
critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or results of operations 
significant judgments and estimates made by our management include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postemployment benefits and forward delivery contracts and financial instruments 
pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities we sponsor various pension plans and also participate in a union sponsored multi employer pension plan for the collective bargaining unit employees at hawesville 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of our pension and other postemployment benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption for pension fund assets  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on historical returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical year compound returns 
we anticipate that our pension investments will generate long term rates of return of 
our expected long term rate of return is based on an assumed asset allocation of equity funds and fixed income funds 
discount rate selection it is our policy to select a discount rate for purposes of measuring obligations under the pension and retiree medical plans by matching cash flows separately for each plan to yields on zero coupon bonds 
we use the citigroup pension liability index for determining these yields 
the citigroup pension liability index was specifically developed to meet the criteria set forth in paragraph of fas the published information at the end of each calendar month includes spot rate yields zero coupon bond yield estimates in half year increments for use in tailoring a discount rate to a particular plan s projected benefit cash flows 
the citigroup pension liability index rate represents the discount rate developed from these spot rate yields  based on the pattern and duration of the benefit payments of a typical  large  somewhat mature pension plan 
the individual characteristics of each plan  including projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  have been taken into account  since discount rates are determined on a plan by plan basis 
we will generally select a discount rate rounded to the nearest  unless specific circumstances provide for a more appropriate non rounded rate to be used 
we believe the projected cash flows used to determine the citigroup pension liability index rate provide a good approximation of the timing and amounts of our defined benefits payments under our plans and no adjustment to the citigroup pension liability index rate has been made 
therefore  as of december   century has selected a discount rate of for all of the post retirement and post employment plans and for our worker s compensation plans 
although the duration of the supplemental executive retirement benefits serb plan is slightly shorter than the salaried plan  century aluminum will also use a discount rate for this plan 
because we do not believe that the difference in duration is significant  and because the obligations of the serb are very small in comparison to the other plans  we feel that the disclosure of a single rate that was used for the majority of the obligations will enhance the reader s understanding of the employee benefit footnote  rather than a weighted average rate that may complicate any determinations the reader may have 
we have modified our approach for selecting a discount rate 
for prior valuations  we looked to the yields on high quality corporate bond indices at the measurement date  such as moody s aa  and made any adjustments  as appropriate  based on differences between the index and our plans 
we changed our approach because the method now used provides for a more precise method of determining an appropriate discount rate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this change is a change in basis of estimation  not a change in method of applying an accounting principle 
lowering the expected long term rate of return by from to would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate assumptions by would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
century provides postemployment benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of our us based operations 
fas requires the accrual of the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire 
we fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims 
measurement of our postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical assumptions for measurement of the postretirement benefits obligation 
changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations 
century assumes medical inflation is initially  declining to over six years and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in one one percentage percentage point increase point decrease in thousands effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation forward delivery contracts and financial instruments we routinely enter into market priced physical and fixed priced financial contracts for the sale of primary aluminum and the purchase of raw materials in future periods 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  in accounting for these types of contracts 
for those physical delivery contracts which management believes are probable of future delivery  such contracts are classified as normal purchases and normal sales and are not accounted for as derivatives 
the aluminum based financial and physical delivery contracts that are derivatives  as provided for in current accounting standards  are marked to market using the lme spot and forward market for primary aluminum 
because there is no quoted futures market price for the us midwest premium component of the market price for primary aluminum  it is necessary for management to estimate the us midwest premium 
fluctuations in the lme price of primary aluminum have a significant impact on gains and losses included in our financial statements from period to period 
unrealized gains and losses are either included in other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges or net gain loss on forward contracts for derivative instruments  depending on criteria as provided for in the accounting standards 
the forward natural gas purchase contracts are marked to market using the nymex spot and forward market for natural gas 
fluctuations in the nymex price of natural gas can have a significant impact on gains and losses included in our financial statements from period to period 
we have designated these forward contracts as cash flow hedges for forecasted natural gas transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as amended 
we assess the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges quarterly 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
the principal contracts affected by these standards and the resulting effects on the financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein

higher price realizations for primary aluminum in  due to an improved lme price and midwest premium for primary aluminum  contributed an additional million in sales 
this amount was partially offset by a million decrease in direct shipment revenues 
direct shipments were million pounds less than the previous year due to reduced pot count at hawesville and fewer days in versus the additional revenue provided by nordural tolling activities for the year ended december  contributed million to the net sales increase 
gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit decreased million to million 
improved price realizations net of increased alumina costs improved gross profit by million 
increased shipment volume  the result of the nordural acquisition  contributed million in additional gross profit 
offsetting these gains were million in net cost increases comprised of higher raw material costs and replacement of pot cells  million  increased cost of gramercy alumina  million  higher power and natural gas costs  million  increased net amortization and depreciation charges  million  increased pension and other post employment benefit accruals  million and other increased spending  million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million relative to the same period in approximately  or million of the increase  was a result of increased compensation and pension expense  with the remaining increase associated with increased professional fees and other general expenses 
in addition  allowance for bad debts was reduced million in  reflecting the settlement of a claim 
interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december  declined million to million 
the reduction in interest expense was a direct result of our refinancing activities during the year net gain loss on forward contracts for the year ended december   net loss on forward contracts was million as compared to a net loss on forward contracts of million for the same period in the loss reported for the year ended december  was primarily a result of mark to market losses associated with our long term financial sales contracts with glencore that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
the losses reported for the year ended december  primarily relate to the early termination of a fixed price forward sales contract with glencore 
loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million with the redemption of the remaining million of outstanding senior secured first mortgage notes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million for the cost of tendering the first mortgage notes 
tax provision we recorded an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million  a change of million from the recorded tax expense of million for the year ended december  the change in the tax provision is due to changes in the income loss before income taxes and the discontinuance of accrual for united states taxes on nordural s earnings  resulting from a decision made in that such earnings would remain invested outside the united states indefinitely 
these items were partially offset by changes in equity in earnings of joint ventures 
equity in earnings of joint venture equity in earnings from the gramercy and sabl investments  which were acquired on october   was million for the year ended december  these earnings represent our share of profits from third party bauxite  hydrate and chemical grade alumina sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million or to  million 
higher price realizations for primary aluminum in  due to an improved lme price and midwest premium for primary aluminum  contributed an additional million in sales 
shipment volume increased million pounds  primarily associated with the nordural acquisition beginning in late april and the acquisition of the additional interest in hawesville beginning in april tolling revenues from the nordural acquisition contributed an additional million in net sales 
the remaining million increase was associated with increased direct shipment volumes 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit improved million to million 
improved price realizations net of increased alumina costs improved gross profit by million with increased shipment volume  primarily a result of nordural acquisition in april and the acquisition of the additional interest in hawesville beginning in april  contributing million in additional gross profit 
offsetting these gains were increased power costs due to lower efficiencies and price  million  raw material quality issues  million  and costs associated with the replacement of pot cells and its effect on operational performance  million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in the increase was primarily a result of incentive compensation expense accruals and increased fees associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance work during the year 
interest expense  net interest expense during the year ended december  declined million to million 
the change in interest expense was a direct result of our refinancing activities in net gain loss on forward contracts 
for the year ended december   net loss on forward contracts was million as compared to a net gain on forward contracts of million for the same period in the loss and gain reported for the years ended december  and december   respectively  primarily relate to the early termination in of a fixed price forward sales contract with glencore and the improved lme price and midwest premium for primary aluminum in the current period 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for the one time cost of tendering the first mortgage notes 
tax provision 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased million due to the changes in income before income taxes discussed above 
equity in earnings of joint venture equity in earnings from the gramercy assets  which were acquired on october   was million in the current period 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and nordural s term loan facility 
we believe these sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our near term working capital needs 
we have not determined the sources of funding for our long term debt repayment requirements  however  it is likely that these sources would include cash flow from operations  available borrowing under our revolving credit facility and to the extent necessary and or economically attractive  future financial market activities 
our principal uses of cash are operating costs  payments of interest on our outstanding debt  the funding of capital expenditures and investments in related businesses  working capital and other general corporate requirements 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  including million of principal under our convertible senior notes  million of principal under our senior notes  million of indebtedness outstanding under the term loan outstanding at nordural  million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  million of principal under our industrial revenue bonds  and million indebtedness outstanding for various site loans at nordural 
more information concerning the various debt instruments and our borrowing arrangements is available in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
adjusted working capital adjusted working capital calculation as of december  restated dollars in thousands current assets current liabilities working capital adjustments convertible senior notes industrial revenue bonds adjusted working capital the convertible senior notes mature in the industrial revenue bonds mature in due to certain features of these debt instruments  they are classified as current liabilities 
for example  the convertible senior notes are classified as current because they may be converted by the holder at any time 
our adjusted working capital decreased during because our due to affiliates liability increased  primarily as a result of the mark to market of derivative contracts with glencore that settle in we expect working capital to increase as the nordural expansion comes on line in with the exception of nordural and mark to market adjustments on our derivative contracts  we do not anticipate significant changes in working capital 
capital resources capital expenditures for were million  million of which was related to the expansion project at nordural  with the balance principally related to upgrading production equipment  maintaining facilities and complying with environmental requirements 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to million in  exclusive of the nordural expansion 
the nordural expansion will require approximately million of capital expenditures in through december   we had outstanding capital commitments related to the nordural expansion of million 
our cost commitments for the nordural expansion may materially change depending on the exchange rate between the us dollar and certain foreign currencies  principally the euro and the icelandic krona 
as of december   we had no hedges to mitigate our foreign currency exposure 
historical our statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and are summarized below dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash from operating activities of million in was million higher than the same period in exclusive of the million cash payment in for the tender premium plus accrued interest for the refinancing of our first mortgage notes  net cash from operating activities decreased million in this decrease was a direct result of lower gross profit  offset by lower debt service costs related to the debt refinancing 
net cash from operating activities of million in was million higher than the same period in exclusive of the million settlement received in from the termination of a primary aluminum sales contract and entering into the glencore metal agreement i for the years through and the million cash payment in for the tender premium plus accrued interest for the refinancing of our first mortgage notes  net cash from operating activities increased million in this increase was a direct result of improved price realizations and the added margin contributions from nordural which was acquired in april net cash used in investing activities in was million  an increase of million from exclusive of the net acquisition cost of million for a southwire contingency payment in april  related to the hawesville acquisition in  the combined net acquisition cost of nordural in april and the gramercy assets in october of million  net cash used in investing activities increased million

purchases of property  plant and equipment  including the nordural expansion costs  were million in as compared to the purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million  a decrease of million from the previous year 
during  we borrowed million under nordural s new term loan facility  borrowed million under our revolving credit facility  and received proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
the additional borrowings were partially offset by debt repayments of million  consisting of payments of million for the remaining first mortgage notes tendered in a debt refinancing  million for the prior nordural term loan facility and million for other miscellaneous debt payments 
additionally  we paid million of financing fees for nordural s new term loan facility and our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million  an increase of million from the previous year 
the increase was primarily due to the issuance of million of debt  and the issuance of million of common stock 
this increase was partially offset by debt repayments of million  consisting of million for the first mortgage notes tendered in a debt refinancing  million for the nordural term loan facility  million for the repayment of the glencore note  and million for other miscellaneous debt payments 
additionally  century paid million of financing fees for the debt issued in the fourth quarter of and million payment of accrued preferred dividends in the second quarter of contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we have entered into various contractual obligations that will be settled in cash 
these obligations consist primarily of long term debt obligations and purchase obligations 
the expected future cash flows required to meet these obligations are shown in the table below 
the purchase obligations consist of long term supply contracts for alumina and electrical power 
the pension and opeb obligations includes the estimated benefit payments through for our pension  serb  other postretirement benefits plans 
other long term liabilities include asset retirement obligations and workers compensation liabilities 
more information is available about these contractual obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
payments due by period total thereafter dollars in millions long term debt estimated interest payments purchase obligations opeb obligations other long term liabilities total debt includes principal repayments on the senior notes  convertible senior notes  the irbs  borrowing on our revolving credit facility  and the nordural debt 
estimated interest payments on our long term debt are based on several assumptions  including the borrowing under the term loan facility for the nordural expansion project and assumptions for the interest rates for our variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt is based primarily on the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
we assume that the eurodollar rate will be in increasing to in and remaining steady thereafter 
the irb s interest rate is variable and our estimated future payments based on a rate of 
in addition  we assume the senior notes due and convertible senior notes due in will remain outstanding until their respective due dates 
the borrowings on our revolving credit facility are assumed to remain outstanding through the term of the credit facility and the interest rate is assumed to be purchase obligations include long term alumina  electrical power contracts  anode contracts and the nordural expansion project commitments 
nordural s power contracts and our domestic alumina contracts  except for our gramercy alumina contract  are priced as a percentage of the lme price of primary aluminum 
we assumed an lme price of  per metric ton for   per metric ton for   per metric ton for and  per metric ton thereafter for purposes of calculating expected future cash flows for these contracts 
our gramercy long term alumina contract has variable cost based pricing 
we used gal cost forecasts to calculate the expected future cash flows for this contract 
the nordural anode contract and some nordural expansion contract commitments are denominated in euros 
we assumed a euro conversion rate to estimate the obligations under these contracts 
includes the estimated benefit payments for our opeb obligations through  which are unfunded 
other long term liabilities include our expected pension contributions  serb benefit payments  workers compensation benefit payments  estimated tax payments and asset retirement obligations 
expected benefit payments for the serb plans  which are unfunded  are included for through our estimated contributions to the pension plans are included for estimated contributions for and beyond are not included in the table because these estimates would be heavily dependent upon assumptions about future events  including  among other things  future regulatory changes  changes to tax laws  future interest rates levels and future return on plan assets 
asset retirement obligations consist primarily of disposal costs for spent potliner 
the amount and timing of these costs are estimated based on the number of operating pots and their expected pot life 
environmental expenditures and other contingencies we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
the aggregate environmental related accrued liabilities were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we believe that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations may change  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we adopted fin in december and recorded an adjustment to our asset retirement obligations 
when we initially adopted sfas no 
in  we recognized asset retirement obligations related to the disposal of spent pot liner used in the reduction cells of our facilities 
in our initial calculation of the asset retirement obligations  we included our costs to remove the spent potliner as part of our asset retirement obligations 
under fin  these removal costs should not have been included in our asset retirement obligations and should have been accounted for as maintenance costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price sensitivity we are exposed to the price of primary aluminum 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of primary aluminum by selling aluminum at fixed prices for future delivery and through financial instruments  as well as by purchasing alumina under supply contracts with prices tied to the same indices as our aluminum sales contracts the lme price of primary aluminum 
our risk management activities do not include any trading or speculative transactions 
the following table shows our forward priced sales as a percentage of our estimated production capacity 
forward priced sales as of december  base volume pounds metric tons percent of capacity potential additional volume pounds metric tons percent of capacity the forward priced sales in exclude january shipments to customers that are priced based upon the prior month s market price 
certain financial contracts included in the forward priced sales base volume for the period through contain clauses that trigger potential additional sales volume when the market price for a contract month is above the base contract ceiling price 
these contacts will be settled monthly and  if the market price exceeds the ceiling price for all contract months through  the potential sales volume would be equivalent to the amounts shown above 
apart from the contracts described under key long term primary aluminum sales contracts  we had forward delivery contracts to sell  metric tons and  metric tons of primary aluminum at december  and december   respectively 
of these forward delivery contracts  we had fixed price commitments to sell  metric tons and  metric tons of primary aluminum at december  and december   respectively  of which  metric tons at december  were with glencore none in 
financial sales agreements to mitigate the volatility in our unpriced forward delivery contracts  we enter into fixed price financial sales contracts  which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended delivery dates of the forward delivery contracts 
certain of these fixed price financial sales contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges depending on our designation of each contract at its inception 
glencore is our counterparty for all of these financial sales contracts 
substantially all of the contracts accounted for as derivatives contain clauses that trigger additional shipment volume when the market price for a contract month is above the contract ceiling price 
if the market price exceeds the ceiling price for all contract months through  the maximum additional shipment volume would be  metric tons 
these contracts will be settled monthly 
we had no fixed price financial contracts to purchase aluminum at december  or december  primary aluminum financial sales contracts as of december  december  cash flow cash flow hedges derivatives total hedges derivatives total metric tons total additionally  to mitigate the volatility of the natural gas markets  we enter into fixed price financial purchase contracts  accounted for as cash flow hedges  which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended usage of natural gas 
one decatherm dth is equivalent to one million british thermal units btu 
natural gas fixed price financial purchase contracts as of december  thousands of dth total on a hypothetical basis  a per metric ton increase in the market price of primary aluminum is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million after tax on accumulated other comprehensive income for the contracts designated as cash flow hedges  and million on net income for the contracts designated as derivatives  for the period ended december  as a result of the forward primary aluminum financial sales contracts outstanding at december  on a hypothetical basis  a per dth decrease in the market price of natural gas is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million after tax on accumulated other comprehensive income for the period ended december  as a result of the forward natural gas financial purchase contracts outstanding at december  our metals and natural gas risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management 
these activities are regularly reported to century s board of directors 
this quantification of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum is necessarily limited  as it does not take into consideration our inventory or forward delivery contracts  or the offsetting impact on the sales price of primary aluminum products 
because all of our alumina contracts  except hawesville alumina contract with gramercy are indexed to the lme price for primary aluminum  they act as a natural hedge for approximately of our production 
as of december   approximately excluding  metric tons of potential additional volume under our derivative sales contracts of our production for was either hedged by the alumina contracts  nordural electrical power and tolling contracts  and or by fixed price forward delivery and financial sales contracts 
nordural 
presently  substantially all of nordural s revenues are derived from a toll conversion agreement with a subsidiary of bhp billiton ltd 
whereby nordural converts alumina provided to it by bhp billiton into primary aluminum for a fee based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
because of this agreement  nordural s revenues are subject to the risk of decreases in the market price of primary aluminum  however  nordural is not exposed to increases in the price for alumina  the principal raw material used in the production of primary aluminum 
in addition  under its power contract  nordural purchases power at a rate which is a percentage of the lme price for primary aluminum  providing nordural with a natural hedge against downswings in the market for primary aluminum 
nordural is exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the euro and the icelandic krona 
under its toll conversion and power contracts  nordural s revenues and power costs are based on the lme price for primary aluminum  which is denominated in us dollars 
there is no currency risk associated with these contracts 
however  nordural s labor costs are denominated in icelandic krona and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros 
as a result  an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the us dollar would affect nordural s operating margins 
nordural does not currently have financial instruments to hedge commodity or currency risk 
nordural may hedge such risks in the future  including the purchase of aluminum put options to hedge nordural s commodity risk 
interest rates interest rate risk 
century s primary debt obligations at december  were the million of outstanding senior unsecured notes  million of outstanding convertible notes  the nordural debt  including million of borrowings under nordural s term loan facility  million of borrowing under the revolving credit facility  and the million in industrial revenue bonds 
the senior unsecured notes and convertible notes bear a fixed rate of interest  so changes in interest rates do not subject century to changes in future interest expense with respect to these borrowings 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates at a margin over libor or the bank base rate  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
the industrial revenue bonds bear interest at variable rates determined by reference to the interest rate of similar instruments in the industrial revenue bond market 
at december   nordural had approximately million of long term debt consisting primarily of obligations under the nordural term loan facility 
borrowings under nordural s term loan facility bear interest at a margin over the applicable eurodollar rate 
at december   nordural had million of liabilities which bear interest at a variable rate 
at december   century had million of variable rate borrowings 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the interest rate would increase our annual interest expense by million  assuming no debt reduction 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate risk  but may do so in the future through interest rate swaps which would have the effect of fixing a portion of our floating rate debt 
our primary financial instruments are cash and short term investments  including cash in bank accounts and other highly rated liquid money market investments and government securities
