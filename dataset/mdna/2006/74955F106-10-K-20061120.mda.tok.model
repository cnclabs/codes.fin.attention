item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business for a description of our business and markets  see the section above entitled business 
executive summary we operate in a very competitive environment characterized by declining average selling prices and frequent product innovation 
our strengths include a our ability to identify and capitalize on trends in a rapidly growing wireless marketplace  b our capability to develop products that have superior technical characteristics  c our expertise to assist our customers in incorporating our products into their applications  and d our demonstrated ability to manufacture high quality cost effective products in volume with short lead times 
our manufacturing capabilities are greatly enhanced by our relationships with several offshore contractors and our own wafer foundry expertise 
arrayed against us are several large competitors who have superior financial and other resources 
see the section above entitled competition for further discussion 
we have competed successfully for over years by cultivating close customer relationships with a diverse group of customers in varied applications  markets and geographic locations 
our base low power components have declined in sales due to decreased average selling prices in competitive automotive and other markets 
as a result  we have focused our product and market developments on products which we feel offer a technical edge and have greater gross margin potential 
a key factor in our sales performance is whether or not we develop and sell enough new products to offset the decline in selling price and unit volume of our older products 
the overall economic conditions in the 
table of contents electronics industry  which has historically experienced extreme increases and decreases in demand within short periods of time  is another key factor that influences our sales performance 
we believe our markets are currently in a period of stable to rising overall demand  depending on the market involved 
a key factor in our gross margin performance is whether or not we can reduce our costs through innovation and increased volume and improve our product mix towards higher margin products to offset expected declines in average selling prices 
the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions implement our strategy to grow sales with new products that have higher margin potential 
we have systematically increased our operating expenses to support our wireless systems initiative and that has somewhat increased our sales breakeven point 
despite increased operating expenses  we have continued to generate positive cash flows in recent periods 
while we intend to continue some level of positive cash flows in future periods  the amount of positive cash flow may decrease or occasionally turn negative due to the need for increased working capital to support increased sales or increased capital spending and other investments to support growth programs 
we feel we currently have the financial resources necessary to execute our business plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods presented 
we have listed below our most significant accounting policies and estimates  which we think are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
please keep the following policies and estimates in mind when reading the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
trade receivables we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer information 
we maintain credit insurance on major foreign customer balances and have a relatively diversified customer base 
in the prior year  we recorded a charge of  due to the commencement of chapter proceedings by delphi corporation 
in current and previous years our losses were much smaller 
however  there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience relatively low rates of loss in the future 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of a large customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and we may incur losses as a result 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out basis or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we use a standard cost system to estimate the actual costs of inventory and regularly review actual costs and the estimated market value of inventory to standard costs 
significant changes to our purchasing or manufacturing costs either an increase or a decrease could cause material changes to the valuation of our inventory when we adjust standard costs to reflect the change 
we estimate the market value of inventory based upon existing and forecasted demand for end products for the next twelve months and estimated amounts of inventory that would be consumed 
we reduce the valuation of inventory items that are in excess supply compared to demand  items that have had 
table of contents limited usage over time  items that may no longer be usable due to product obsolescence and items that we decide to discontinue selling 
we have a product rationalization process that involves key management personnel to identify and evaluate products and related inventory that fall into one or more of these categories 
in recent years we have written off significant amounts of inventory 
in fiscal year  we wrote down million of inventory to reflect changes that occurred in our marketing strategy to accelerate the migration of our products to smaller packages 
this was done in response to an abrupt shift in market requirements toward smaller packages 
inventory write downs in the last three years were much smaller 
if the facts and circumstances require it  we may have to write down inventory again in future periods 
the electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could make such write downs necessary 
also  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the valuation adjustments for obsolete and slow moving inventory may be understated or overstated 
if we change our estimate of future demand  we may have to increase or decrease our inventory valuation reserves for excess inventory  with a corresponding impact on cost of sales 
we continually review our inventory valuations for all of these factors 
however  significant changes in manufacturing costs  unanticipated changes in product demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we regularly review our long lived assets for changes in circumstances indicating that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable based on its estimated undiscounted cash flows 
we measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
as an example  we have moved assembly production offshore and consolidated our dallas operations 
this change in circumstances caused us to test for an impairment loss and ultimately record a million charge in fiscal year related to fixed assets 
there was no material impairment loss in the last three fiscal years 
deferred income taxes in fiscal year  we recorded a full asset valuation allowance against tax loss carryforwards and other tax benefits according to the sfas accounting for income taxes guidelines 
since then we have recorded no significant net federal tax benefits or expenses  since they were offset by the valuation allowance 
the only exception to this was in fiscal year when a change in tax law allowed us to collect a significant tax refund  which was recorded in the period in which the change in tax law occurred 
we may record relatively small amounts of tax expense in future periods related to alternative minimum income taxes due on either a state or federal level 
we still retain a large amount of potential tax benefits for tax loss carryforwards and other factors  as explained in the notes to the financial statements 
these benefits may be realized in future periods 
as a result  we do not expect to record significant federal income tax expense related to operations in the near future 
accrued medical benefits we largely self insure the payment of medical benefits to our employees 
consequently we regularly estimate the value of unpaid benefits based upon historical trends and use that information to record our liability for benefits that have been incurred but not yet paid 
we have stop loss insurance protection to cover the costs of medical claims over certain deductible amounts for any given plan year for an individual claimant or in the aggregate 
however  medical claims may significantly and unexpectedly increase or 
table of contents decrease over a short period of time  in which case our liability for unpaid claims may no longer be accurate 
this could cause us to either increase or decrease medical expense in a material way in the period in which the change occurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the most part when we ship the product to the customer 
less than of fiscal year sales were recognized under programs in which inventory is consigned to a customer 
we recognize sales from consigned products when the customer pulls the product for use from the consigned inventory 
in all cases  we recognize sales at the point at which legal title passes to the customer 
our standard terms and conditions are fob our factory 
we permit the return of defective products and accept limited amounts of product returns in other instances 
accordingly  we provide allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns based on historical experience when we recognize revenue 
a small portion of our revenue  called technology development sales  is derived from engineering design services performed for customers 
in our next fiscal year  we will need to incorporate software revenue recognition procedures to account for the revenue generated by aleier  our newly created subsidiary 
results of operations in this section we will discuss our financial statements 
in doing this  we will make comparisons between the following periods  which we believe are relevant to understanding trends in our business the fiscal year ended august   referred to as current year or fiscal  is compared to our fiscal year ended august   referred to as prior year or fiscal fiscal is compared to our fiscal year ended august   referred to as fiscal the three months ended august   referred to as current quarter or fourth quarter  compared to the three months ended august   referred to as comparable quarter of the prior year or prior year quarter  and the three months ended may   referred to as the previous quarter or third quarter 

table of contents the following table displays  for the years ended august  a the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to total sales and b the percentage change in these items from year to year percentage of sales year to year change to to sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other expense  net income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss sales the following table displays sales for our product lines and the percentage relationship of those product lines to total sales for the periods indicated years ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales wireless solutions business virtual wire radio  rfic and module products wireless components business filters frequency control modules low power components subtotal total product sales technology development sales total sales 
table of contents overall sales trends in fiscal compared to fiscal our total sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the primary reason for this was an increase in sales for three of our four product lines due to an increase in the number of units sold 
this increase was the result of greater market acceptance of fairly new products  particularly for the satellite radio application 
sales for the fourth product line low power components decreased in line with trends seen in prior years  as explained below in the section entitled product line sales trends low power components 
we have anticipated this trend of lower sales of low power components products for some time 
as a result  for several years we have focused our product and market development efforts on products with higher technical content  which allows them to be sold at higher average selling prices 
we had considerable success in increasing sales for these higher priced products in the current year 
sales increased more than for these products  as we sold more units  particularly filters for the satellite radio application which is discussed below 
one of the biggest factors in determining what happens to total sales in the future will be whether or not the anticipated growth in higher priced product line sales will be greater than or less than the anticipated decline in sales for our low power components and other older products 
we compete in very price competitive markets in which customers require decreased prices over time to retain their business 
in addition  we understand that as new products ramp up in volume our customers expect economies of scale to result in lower pricing 
as a result  each of our product lines experienced a decline in average selling prices in the range of to in the current year 
a decline in average selling prices adversely impacts gross margin  as well as sales 
therefore  offsetting this impact is an important part of our strategic plan 
we have achieved significant market position in most of the markets on which we focus 
however  we believe that price competition from much larger and better financed competitors represents a significant risk in maintaining our sales levels and gross margins  particularly in the automotive and consumer market 
our sales success is highly dependent on the following factors achieving technological advances in our product design and manufacturing capabilities  our ability to sell our products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors  such as economic and regulatory conditions  competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating our technologies  and the impact of competitive pricing 
these and other factors may adversely affect our ability to grow or even maintain our sales levels 
we have put forth considerable effort developing new products 
however  the timing of any sales resulting from new products is dependent upon the customers product development and product introduction cycles 
it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  new products will have a significant impact on our sales 
we have seen that consumer applications are often part of special promotional programs by our customers  so sales to those customers will tend to fluctuate with the timing of those programs 
we have experienced sudden increases in demand in the past  which have put pressure on our manufacturing facilities and those of our offshore contractors to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than we currently possess 
we may not be able to increase our manufacturing capacity  the manufacturing capacity of our assembly contractors  or improve our manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this could result in a material loss of potential sales 
overall sales trends in fiscal compared to fiscal our total sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the primary reason for this was a decrease in sales of low power components of almost in fiscal the number of low power components units sold decreased due to a slow down in automotive production schedules and loss of sales to some customers for older style products to alternative technologies such as phased locked loop 
in 
table of contents addition  there was an ongoing decrease in average unit selling prices of almost 
the primary market for low power components is the automotive market for remote keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring applications 
the automotive market is very price competitive and we have had to reduce average selling prices significantly in recent years to maintain our market position 
we have anticipated these trends for some time 
as a result  for several years we have focused our product and market development efforts on products with additional technical content  which allows them to be sold at higher average selling prices 
we had considerable success in increasing sales for these higher priced products in the current year 
sales increased more than for these products  as we sold more units  particularly filters for the satellite radio application which is discussed in the section below entitled product line sales trends filters 
product line sales trends virtual wire short range radio products sales for virtual wire short range radio products increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase in the current year was due to a increase in the number of units sold 
the increase in the number of units sold was primarily due to greater market acceptance for two growth applications amr and medical 
we have focused on these applications for some time 
in addition  sales increased approximately million to our world wide network of distributors  returning to more normal levels 
in the prior year  sales to distributors had declined significantly from fiscal as a result of decreases in inventory levels that occurred in their supply chains 
partially offsetting the increase in the number of units sold for these products was a reduction in average selling prices  as competitive conditions forced us to lower prices 
included in virtual wire short range radio products sales this year were a small amount of wireless solutions module sales and rfic sales 
these amounted to less than of those sales 
the wireless solutions modules will be discussed in the next section 
to provide customers more choices in the radio technology field  we announced a new line of rfic products in fiscal these are intended to cover market niches and price points that the virtual wire short range radio products cannot 
the decrease in sales from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in average selling price  as competitive conditions forced us to lower prices 
the increase in number of units sold to amr applications in the prior year were offset by a decrease in sales to several distributors as a result of reduced inventory levels in their supply chains 
sales to distributors returned to normal levels in the current year 
for several years we have devoted considerable resources developing and marketing virtual wire short range radio products 
we believe these products offer potential for considerable growth in sales in numerous wireless applications  particularly for applications that require small size and low power consumption 
we intend to continue working with our customers to develop new applications using virtual wire short range radio products and we expect future sales increases for these products 
we recently announced the launch of our third generation of this product  which will add several new features and will be available for sale in fiscal in addition  we announced a new line of rfic products  including receivers  transmitters and transceivers 
we are not certain when  if ever  these new products will significantly impact future sales 
wireless systems during the prior year  we formed the wireless solutions group 
since then  we have invested considerable resources in product and marketing development to support our strategic plan for the wireless solutions group 
for a description of the industrial market we see for these products and our strategy to capture a portion of it  see the section above entitled item  business 
we recently announced the release of 
table of contents another fcc certified standard product for this market and completed a great deal of work on custom development contracts  which are classified as technology development sales 
we now have a variety of sensor modules available for sale with several different network protocol options 
our sales force is now working with customers to design these products into their applications 
in the current year  we sold initial volumes of these products 
while we see great potential for wireless systems product  it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  these products will have a significant impact on our sales 
the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions also have wireless systems products 
filters filter sales increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in both fiscal years we sold an increased number of units  particularly for satellite radio applications 
the unit increase was in the current year and in fiscal we provide filters for radios that provide services from both sirius satellite radio inc nasdaq siri and xm satellite radio holdings  inc nasdaq xmsr 
we are working with both service providers on future generations of product and we expect sales for the satellite radio application to continue to increase as subscriptions for those services continue to increase 
we have seen both automotive and general consumer applications for satellite radio service increase 
in the current year  we experienced an increase in market share 
since we now have a dominant position in this market  we do not expect further increases solely due to an increase in market share 
the consumer portion of the satellite radio market is characterized by very short lead times as the radio manufacturers wait for orders from retail customers before placing orders for components 
as a result  forecasting is very difficult 
partially offsetting the increase in the number of units sold was a reduction in average selling price of in the current year and in the prior year 
a portion of this was due to increased sales for newer products in smaller packages that have lower average selling prices  as well as the fact that competitive conditions force us to provide lower prices to maintain our position 
the automotive and consumer markets tend to be more price competitive than the other markets we serve 
we expect the trend for an increasing number of units sold to roughly offset the trend for lower average selling prices  resulting in a general trend of stable filter sales for at least the immediate future 
late in the year  both satellite radio service providers were negatively impacted by fcc actions that took several versions of their products off the market until changes were made eliminating electronic interference 
although this legal issue did not involve our products  the regulatory action had an almost immediate impact in our shipments to customers that build radios for this application 
regulatory actions which negatively impact the satellite radio market could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
frequency control modules frequency control module sales increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase in both years was primarily due to an increased number of units sold to customers in high end computer and internet infrastructure markets 
we believe the increased number of units sold represents a continued recovery in economic conditions in the telecommunication markets 
while there have been some decreases in average selling prices for frequency control module products  the pressures are not nearly as great as in some of our other markets 
future sales of these products will be highly dependent upon economic conditions in the markets these products serve 
low power components sales for low power components products decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in sales for the current year was due to an decrease in number of units sold and a decrease in average selling prices 
two major automotive applications for these products tire pressure monitoring  or tpm  and remote keyless entry  or 
table of contents rke experienced a total reduction in sales of approximately million due to conversion to other technology and a general reduction in north american automobile production schedules 
many of our products sold into this application are very mature and conversion to other technologies such as multiple function integrated circuits and phased lock loop has been going on for years 
in addition  some customers have switched to very low priced competitors 
the decrease in rke sales was million in the prior year 
for years our sales to the tpm application have been less than we expected due to delays in the implementation of tire safety regulations 
this delay has allowed alternative technologies to take significant market share with a customized solution 
therefore we no longer believe the tpm application will be a significant driver for future growth  although some level of sales will continue indefinitely 
we have focused our sales efforts for low power components on market niches where our total solution is valued by the customer 
in addition  we continue to provide additional package options and seek general cost reductions to remain competitive 
although we think sales of low power components may continue to decline  we believe we can maintain considerable market share in the niches we are targeting 
the primary market for these products is the automotive market  which is characterized by very competitive conditions and declining average selling prices 
the reduction in average selling prices for low power components has been somewhat moderated in recent years by a reduction in the number of units sold of some of the lowest priced products 
we expect that the trend of lower average selling prices for low power component products to continue  as competitive market conditions require future price reductions 
the decrease in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in the number of units sold and a decrease in average selling prices 
the primary reason for the reduction in the number of units sold was a reduction overall in north american automotive production levels  as well as to ongoing loss of market share to alternative technologies 
we expect that the trend of lower sales for low power components will continue into the next fiscal year  due to continued reduction in average selling prices  continued conversion of customers away from older products to alternative technologies and generally low north american automotive production levels 
during the year  sales of low power components products fluctuated in accordance with changing production schedules for automotive customers 
we expect this fluctuation to continue 
other sales trends the following table provides additional data concerning our sales percentage of sales sales for top five customers distribution sales number of customers with or more sales one one none sales for or more customer n a international sales the increase in sales to the top five customers in the current year results from sales increases in satellite radio applications 
our largest customer for the current year is delphi corporation which is currently in chapter bankruptcy and involved in negotiations with its labor unions 
while we are encouraged by the reported progress in those negotiations  a protracted strike in the north american automotive industry could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents our strategy is to seek diversification in our sales 
we believe we have achieved a significant level of diversification in our customers  markets  products and geographic areas 
however  due to the very competitive nature of the markets in which we compete  we may not always be able to achieve such diversification 
we consider all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
international sales are denominated primarily in us currency  although some european customers require that we sell in euros 
we have not entered into any hedging activities to mitigate the exchange risk associated with sales in foreign currency 
we intend to continue our focus on international sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our business 
however  international sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of local economic conditions and competition 
therefore  we cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to derive similar levels of our business from international sales 
stock compensation expense at the beginning of the current year  we adopted fasb statement r 
most of the expense recorded related to the unvested portion of stock grants that were made in prior years 
in addition  the current year includes the impact of restricted stock units  or rsus 
we have switched to rsus as our primary stock compensation vehicle in lieu of stock options to better match the employees perceived benefit with the financial statement cost 
the adoption of fasb statement r and change to rsus in lieu of stock options has resulted in recording additional stock compensation expense in the current fiscal year as follows fourth quarter year to date cost of sales research and development expense sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense total additional stock compensation expense the adoption of fasb statement r did not affect our accounting treatment of stock options granted to consultants and is not reflected in the table above 
stock compensation expense for consultant s stock options of  and  for the quarter and year to date  respectively  was recognized as it has been in prior years 
we expect to record slightly smaller amounts of stock compensation expense in the next fiscal year as the prior stock compensation vehicles become vested and the new rsu grants become the primary vehicle for employee incentive compensation 
we intend to continue to use various stock plans as an important part of our compensation package 
we are competing for talent with other companies that have stock plans in place and our work force values stock as a form of compensation 
we have made some changes to our employee stock purchase program to shorten the offering period and eliminate the look back provision  while retaining the discount allowable for tax purposes 
we intend to primarily issue rsus in lieu of stock options in future periods to lessen dilution and control expense 

table of contents gross profit gross profit trends in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit margin remained nearly the same at in the current year  compared to in fiscal the gross margin percentage of sales would have been almost exactly the same if the current year had not included a  increase in stock compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fasb statement r and our change to rsus in lieu of stock options 
the ongoing impact of lower average selling prices for our products going into competitive markets was almost entirely offset by the net effect of our cost reduction efforts 
margins improved slightly for our virtual wire short range radio products and frequency control modules  as cost reductions exceeded decreases in average selling prices 
margins were unchanged for our filters  despite a decrease in average selling prices due to a similar amount of per unit manufacturing cost reduction 
only low power components experienced a slight decline in margins  as the decrease in the number of units shipped resulted in a higher overhead cost per unit as a relatively high amount of fixed overhead costs were spread over fewer units 
fixed manufacturing costs include a significant amount of depreciation expense for manufacturing equipment 
each of our product lines experienced a decline in average selling prices in the current year of or more 
we expect this trend to continue  so ongoing cost reduction is crucial to maintaining or improving gross margin 
gross profit trends in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the primary reason for the decreased margin was that the ongoing impact of lower average selling prices for our products going into competitive markets was greater than the net effect of our cost reduction efforts 
for instance  the selling prices for our filter products declined from the prior year  while costs only declined 
in addition  the cost reduction we achieved for our low power component products was less than planned due to the fact that the reduction in the number of units shipped resulted in an increase in the overhead costs per unit  since a relatively high amount of fixed manufacturing costs were spread over fewer units 
this volume effect was magnified by our efforts to hold down production rates to reduce inventory levels 
each of our product lines experienced a decline in average selling prices in fiscal of or more 
we expect this trend to continue  so ongoing cost reduction is crucial to maintaining or improving gross margin 
during fiscal  we achieved cost reductions of or more on each of our product lines  except for low power components  which experienced a slight cost increase 
factors influencing gross margins our gross margin continues to be influenced by several factors  both favorable and unfavorable 
the favorable factors that influence gross margin represent our long term efforts to improve gross margins 
these include success in achieving ongoing cost reduction each of our product lines has achieved cost reduction on a year over year per unit manufacturing cost basis for the past two years  except for low power components as mentioned above under the section entitled gross profit trends in fiscal compared to fiscal we devote considerable resources to obtaining purchasing savings and in working with our suppliers and outside contractors to improve yields  increase productivity and improve processes that result in lower costs 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs in future periods 

table of contents shift in product mix our higher priced products  such as virtual wire short range radio products  frequency control modules and certain custom filters  have a greater long term potential for gross margins than the very price sensitive low power component and satellite radio filter products 
a shift in sales to the virtual wire short range radio products and frequency control modules has a large positive impact on margins 
these higher margin products in the current year represented of total sales  compared to in the previous year  so there was minimal shift in margins resulting from mix in the current year 
however  our strategy is to increase the portion of sales to products that have higher potential gross margins 
our efforts to focus product development resources on the wireless solutions business typify this strategy 
we believe the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions will greatly accelerate this strategy  resulting in improved gross margins 
while this is our strategy  we cannot assure you that such an improved product mix will be achieved in future periods 
in fact  at times during our prior year our product mix shifted unfavorably  resulting in lower margins 
higher number of units sold or produced this factor results in lower average unit cost due to relatively high fixed manufacturing costs being spread over a larger amount of sales and production 
our plan is to increase sales to achieve this result 
however  if sales were to decrease in future periods  this factor would become an unfavorable factor  as happened with low power components products in the current year 
unfavorable factors which influence gross margin  some of which are outside of our control  include  but are not limited to  the following decrease in average selling prices as discussed above  there was a reduction in average selling prices in all of our product lines 
we expect that the trend toward lower average selling prices within our product lines will continue due to competitive pressures and the fact that newer products  like older products  are reaching levels at which customers expect volume based price breaks 
the impact of non cash charges for obsolescence and write downs of inventory for example  we incurred substantial non cash charges and write downs in fiscal new products encounter ramp up costs associated with new manufacturing processes we will continue to introduce new products into our manufacturing processes  and  therefore  we may be subject to unanticipated new product production costs that negatively affect our gross margin 
incremental manufacturing costs from time to time we may experience production issues at our facility in dallas or at one or more of our offshore contractors facilities 
this may result in additional processing  more than normal scrap loss or additional expediting costs to protect customer deliveries 
this occurred temporarily during our prior year 
research and development expense research and development expense was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we made a strategic decision to increase research and development expense in fiscal and have maintained spending in that range ever since 
research and development expenses were of sales in the current year and in fiscal  compared to of sales in fiscal the focus of our development efforts in the current year was to develop products for the wireless solutions business 
besides another generation of our virtual wire short range radio products  we developed several proprietary modules that involve a variety of protocol firmware options to facilitate network communication between the modules 
the current year also included a  increase in stock 
table of contents compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fasb statement r and our change to rsus in lieu of stock options 
we also increased cost of sales related to engineering technology sales by approximately  to support custom engineering projects for wireless solutions customers 
we believe that the continued development of our technology and new products is essential to our success and we are committed to increasing our investment in research and development expense over the long term 
with the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions  we will be adding a considerable number of technical personnel 
therefore  we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in the next quarter 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses were of sales in the current year and in fiscal  compared to of sales in fiscal the current year increase was largely the result of increase in sales commission expenses that fluctuated in line with sales levels 
current year increases also included increased marketing support for our wireless solutions business and additional sales application support for our customers 
the current year included a  increase in stock compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fasb statement r and our change to rsus in lieu of stock options 
we intend to continue to aggressively grow sales  so we expect to maintain a relatively high level of sales and marketing expense 
with the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions  we will be adding a considerable number of sales and marketing personnel 
therefore  we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in the next quarter 
sales commission expenses will continue to fluctuate in line with sales levels 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were of sales in the current year and in fiscal  compared to of sales in fiscal the current year included a  increase in stock compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fasb statement r and our change to rsus in lieu of stock options 
the increase in the current year was also partially due to an increase in executive compensation expense 
with the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions  we will be adding some administrative personnel  as well as some other administrative expenses 
therefore  we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in the next quarter 
amortization of acquired intangible assets we will allocate the purchase price of the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions to various assets and liabilities in an opening balance sheet 
we will make a preliminary estimate in our first quarter  to be finalized by the end of the fiscal year 
part of that allocation will be to intangible assets  such as acquired technology  customer relationships  trademarks  goodwill  etc 
we have retained the services of a business valuation advisor  who will advise us on the valuation estimates 
a very preliminary estimate is that there are substantial intangible assets approximately million  most of which have definitive lives 
we currently estimate that the quarterly cost of the amortization of these intangible assets will be in the  to  range for our first quarter 
most of this cost will be classified as operating expense  but some will impact cost of sales 

table of contents other income expense other income expense increased to  expense in the current year  compared to only  expense in the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase in expense was that we incurred approximately  in expense related to start up costs for a wireless systems investment that we account for as minority interest 
this was partially offset by an increase of approximately  in increased interest income as a result of our increased cash balances 
subsequent to year end  we used part of our cash balance and increased our bank borrowings to pay for a portion of the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions 
income tax expense benefit in both the current and prior years we recorded small provisions for state income tax 
in the current year  because of a net operating loss  or nol  carryforward  we have only a  provision for alternative minimum federal and state income tax 
in the prior year  there was a  tax benefit as a result of a reversal of prior tax provisions 
we expect to record relatively small income tax provisions in the near future 
the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions should not have a material impact on income tax expense 
in fiscal  the alternative minimum income tax is expected to cause a tax expense of approximately of taxable income 
in fiscal  we fully reserved  in a non cash charge  all tax benefits that had been recorded prior to that point in accordance with sfas we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to our historical losses and a limited history of taxable income 
however  we retain the tax benefits involved and we will realize the benefit in future periods to the extent we are profitable 
as of the end of the current year  we have income tax carryforwards and other potential tax benefits available to reduce future federal taxable income by approximately million as explained in note to our financial statements 
the nol carryforwards expire august  we do not expect to record any significant future federal income tax benefits or expense until the recovery of deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
earnings loss per share net income for the current year was million  compared to million for the prior year and million for fiscal our diluted earnings per share were for fiscal  compared to per share for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in the current year was primarily due to increased sales at approximately the same gross margin  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a result of our additional operating expenses to support our strategic plan and an increase in stock compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fasb statement r and our change to rsus in lieu of stock options 
the impact of increased stock compensation in the current year was million or per diluted share 
fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note to the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter of million increased approximately  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
sales decreased approximately compared to the previous quarter 
the sales increase in the current quarter compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year followed the same pattern and was for the same reasons as the year to date increase 
sales increased in three of our four product lines as a result of an increase in the number of units sold by at least for each product line due to greater market acceptance of relatively new products 
for example  the number of filters sold more than doubled from the comparable quarter of the prior year  primarily from the growing satellite radio application 

table of contents the increase in sales of virtual wire short range radio products was particularly large when compared to last year s fourth quarter when sales to distributors were relatively low as a result of inventory reduction that occurred in their supply chain 
the sales increase in the fourth quarter for frequency control modules was also particularly high due to a recovery in economic conditions in the telecommunications market from the prior year s depressed levels 
partially offsetting these sales increases in the current quarter was a decrease in average selling prices in all product lines that occurred due to continuing competitive pressures  including a decrease for filters and a decrease for low power components 
in the current quarter  overall low power components sales decreased from the comparable quarter of the prior year  primarily due to a reduction in the number of units sold due to lower north american automobile production levels and continued loss of market share for older products  as discussed under the section above entitled low power components 
in the current quarter  our sales decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to an decrease in sales of filters resulting from a decrease in the number of units sold  primarily as a result of the slow down in filters for the satellite radio application that occurred late in the current quarter 
this filter slow down resulted from the reaction of the supply chain to the fcc ruling to cease sales of several types of satellite radios 
it is not yet clear how long this ruling will be in effect and therefore we are not certain what the impact will be on our filter sales in our first quarter 
partially offsetting this decrease in sales in the current quarter was a seasonal increase in low power components sales of a consumer toy application  which also occurred in the prior year s fourth quarter 
gross profit margin was in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year and for the previous quarter 
the primary reason for the increase in gross margin from the comparable period of the prior year was a positive shift in product mix 
the total of the higher margin virtual wire short range radio products and frequency control modules increased from of total sales in the prior year quarter to of total sales in the current quarter 
the impact of product mix more than offset the impact of the decrease in average selling prices that was described earlier 
in addition  each of the product lines was able to achieve per unit manufacturing cost reductions of or more in comparison to the comparable quarter of the prior year to moderate the impact of the decrease in average selling prices 
the decrease in margin from the previous quarter was primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices that occurred in the low power component and filter product lines of or more 
we were not able to offset this effect with an equal amount of per unit manufacturing cost reductions in comparison to the previous quarter 
operating expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the comparable quarter of the prior year and million for the previous quarter 
the increase in operating expenses from the comparable quarter of the prior year was primarily due to approximately  in increased spending to support our strategic plan to grow the business   in increased sales commission expense due to increased sales and  in stock compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fasb statement r and change to rsus in lieu of stock options 
general and administrative expense in the current quarter was also impacted by the absence of a  bad debt charge that occurred in the comparable quarter of the prior year  partially offset the current quarter s increased executive compensation expense 
other expense was  in the fourth quarter  the same as the comparable quarter of the prior year and less than the  in the previous quarter 
the decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower start up costs for a wireless systems investment that we account for as minority interest 

table of contents financial condition financing arrangements at august   we maintained access to our revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association  or wfb 
there were no borrowings against the line of credit during the current year 
our revolving line of credit facility loan balance was zero at august   but a loan advance of approximately million was available under the existing borrowing base 
on september   our banking agreement with wfb was amended and restated to increase the revolving credit arrangement to a limit of million and add a million term note facility 
the term of the agreement was extended to december  the main purpose of this amended and restated agreement was to help finance the cirronet acquisition 
see discussion of this acquisition in note of our financial statements 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded with a portion of the proceeds from our new million credit facility with wfb 
the collateral for the revolver is the combined trade receivables of rfm and its subsidiaries 
if the new agreement had been in place as of august   it would not have materially impacted our credit availability as of that date 
our new revolving line of credit banking agreement and its status at the end of the year are described in note to our financial statements included in this report 
our prior agreement with wfb contained certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all of such covenants as of august  the new bank agreement with wfb has similar financial covenants  as well as an additional covenant on financial leverage 
although we believe that we will be able to continue to comply with the covenants contained in our new credit facility  there is no assurance that this will occur 
should there be a violation of one or more of the financial covenants  when we have outstanding borrowings  and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment  the maturity of our debt could be accelerated 
in that case  other sources of cash would be needed to support our operations 
liquidity liquidity at august  consisted primarily of million of cash and approximately million available under the existing banking agreement 
net cash provided by our operating activities was million in the current year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
the primary reason for decreased cash provided by operations was million in funds needed in working capital items to support increased sales in the current year compared to a million in funds provided by a reduction in working capital due to lower sales in the prior year 
included in the noncash items was  in stock based compensation 
partially offsetting this working capital impact was an increase in net income adjusted for noncash items of  compared to the prior year 
collection of our receivables on a days sales outstanding measurement remained in the low day range in the current year 
the inventory increase occurred mostly in finished goods for satellite radio filters that occurred late in the year as a result of the slow down in the satellite radio market that was explained above in the section entitled fourth quarter of fiscal we are working with our offshore contractors to adjust our production levels to offset this effect 
since we offer our customers shorter lead times than we get from our contractors  volatile sales levels can lead to changes in inventory balances 
we continued to be within payment terms with our vendors in fiscal even with the new acquisitions  we expect to maintain a positive cash flow from operations for fiscal  as we did in the last five years 
we believe continued positive cash flow  as well as access to our credit facilities  will be sufficient to maintain normal operations for the next twelve months 

table of contents cash used in investing activities was million in the current year  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to capital spending of approximately million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
a significant amount of the capital spending in the current year related to implementation of software systems that are intended to enhance our new product development process 
most of the million in increased other assets were costs related to the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions 
we expect to acquire up to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  primarily related to the development of new products and new manufacturing processes 
we were provided million in net cash from financing activities in the current year  the same as the prior year 
in the current and prior year  no funds were used to reduce bank borrowings  since the bank debt was paid off in fiscal we raised million from sales of stock to employees under various stock programs in the current year  compared to million last year 
while our switch to rsus as a stock compensation vehicle will tend to lower future proceeds from sales of stock to employees  the stock options that were assumed as a result of the cirronet acquisition will result in additional proceeds 
as of august   we had approximately million of cash availability under the prior banking agreement based upon the borrowing base which is derived from trade accounts receivable 
in addition  approximately million more may become available under our new banking agreement if our borrowing base were to increase sufficiently to support increased borrowing 
we are not able to say when or if that will happen because of our inability to see very far into the future due to limited lead times on orders placed by our customers 
in addition  our new bank agreement gives us million in availability under a term loan that was subsequently used to partially finance the cirronet acquisition 
after the transaction closed  we still had approximately million in availability under the new bank agreement at the end of september  while we reported positive operating cash flows for the last five fiscal years  a reduction in sales or gross margins could occur due to economic or other factors 
in addition  we incurred large cash commitments under the terms of the cirronet and caver morehead acquisitions as described in note of our financial statements 
we believe that cash generated from operations  our cash balances and the amounts available under our new credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
if for any reason these sources of funds are not sufficient to meet our requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain additional financing or  if available  that it would be available to us on acceptable terms 
should that happen  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations 
contractual obligations the following represent our known contractual obligations as of august  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years over years contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total includes minimum lease payment obligations for noncancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note to our financial statements 
these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
the reported amount is the value of three month commitments required by contracts with three manufacturers for product assembly costs 
amount does not include open purchase orders for raw material 
see note to our financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation plans a stock option program description our stock compensation program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented personnel and align shareholder and employee interests 
we currently have four plans plan  plan  plan and director plan under which we grant or have granted stock options to employees  directors and consultants 
the options generally vest at a rate of one forty eighth each month 
the exercise price of each option equals the market price of our stock on the date of grant and each option generally expires ten years after the date of grant 
the plan expired for future grants according to its terms in november the director plan expired for future grants according to its terms in april we also use the plan to grant rsus 
the grants are not considered issued stock when granted and certificates are issued to the grantee only as vesting occurs 
however  upon stockholder approval  no further grants will be made under the plan and any shares remaining under the plan will be granted under our new equity incentive plan 
we record unearned compensation based on the share price on the date of grant  and expense that compensation over the vesting period 
we adopted a recent accounting pronouncement  sfas r for employees and directors for our fiscal year beginning september  using the modified prospective method 
in compliance with the standard  we recorded stock based compensation expense in the current fiscal year relating to stock options for employees and directors and our employee stock purchase plan 
prior to the current fiscal year  we accounted for our option plans under apb and  accordingly  did not recognize compensation expense for options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to consultants are accounted for under sfas r and are valued using the black scholes model 
compensation expense of those options is recognized over the vesting life of the options  which is aligned with the consulting service life 
note to our financial statements sets forth the stock compensation expense recognized in the current and prior two years
