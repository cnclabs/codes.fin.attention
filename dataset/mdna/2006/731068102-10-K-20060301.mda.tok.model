item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion pertains to the results of operations and financial position of the company for each of the three years in the period ended december   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
on september   the company announced its decision to discontinue the manufacture of marine products effective immediately 
the marine products division s financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
executive level overview for the full year ended december   polaris reported record net income from continuing operations of million  an increase of five percent over net income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  earnings per share from continuing operations was per diluted share for the year ended december   an eight percent increase over earnings per share of per diluted share for the same period in sales from continuing operations for the full year ended december  totaled a record billion  up five percent compared to sales from continuing operations of billion for the full year the company s product lines consist of atvs and utility vehicles  snowmobiles  motorcycles and related pg a 
atvs is the largest product line representing percent of polaris sales in the increase in total company sales in was due to growth in all product lines  except snowmobiles 
the increase in atvs  victory motorcycles and pg a sales was driven primarily by new product introductions during the year 
the company sells its products through a network of  dealers in north america and five subsidiaries and distributors in countries outside of north america 
the company has increased its foreign presence with sales outside of north america representing over percent of total company sales in compared to percent in the company s gross profit in decreased two percent from and the gross margin percentage declined to percent compared to percent in primarily due to higher commodity costs  floor plan financing and an increase in warranty expenses compared to in polaris invested in austrian motorcycle manufacturer ktm by purchasing a percent interest in that company from a third party for million 
income from the investment in ktm is recorded on an after tax basis on the income statement as a component of equity in income of manufacturing affiliates and totaled million for the portion of the year the ktm investment was held 
additionally  during the year the company entered into a new multi year contract with hsbc  which provides for income to be paid to polaris based on a percentage of the volume of retail credit business generated 
the previous agreement provided for equal sharing of all income and losses with respect to the retail credit portfolio 
the new agreement removes all credit and funding risk to polaris and also eliminates the need for polaris to maintain a retail credit cash deposit with hsbc  which was million on august   the effective date of the new agreement 
income from financial services  which includes income generated from both the retail credit portfolio and the wholesale credit portfolio  increased percent to million in compared to million in there were a number of challenges during including the following lower consumer confidence  including concerns about increasing gasoline prices and home heating costs higher commodity and transportation costs  particularly energy related costs  driven by hurricanes rita and katrina higher inventory levels both at the factory and the dealers rising interest rates in response to these challenges  management made a number of timely adjustments that enabled polaris to produce another record year of earnings per share for the shareholders 
in addition to effectively managing the business through a difficult period  several important moves were made during that will help to positively position polaris for the future including the successful introduction of several new atvs  rangers  snowmobiles and victory motorcycles the announcement of an exciting strategic partnership with ktm an austrian based motorcycle manufacturer with a strong international presence the modification of the retail credit relationship with hsbc  which contributed to improved earnings and cash flow in addition to removing all credit and funding risk to polaris completion of the new research and development facility in wyoming  minnesota many of the challenges the company experienced throughout will likely continue into the first half of north american atv retail sales for the industry are expected to continue to be soft  commodity costs are expected to remain higher than historical levels  and dealer and factory inventories remain higher than desired given current economic and industry conditions 
however  once these near term headwinds begin to abate  polaris expects to be well positioned to capitalize on strengthening demand 
the underlying businesses of polaris are strong  with a diverse portfolio of industry leading products  and the company has made some very strategic investments that should drive growth and increased profitability for many years to come

revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer or distributor 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program have not been material 
however  polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
polaris financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
polaris has not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
sales promotions and incentives polaris generally provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume discounts  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  reflecting a slight increase in the atv sales promotions and incentives environment during and increased dealer inventory levels 
actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the company s expectations and differences have not been material 
dealer holdback programs polaris provides dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment polaris withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product 
polaris records these amounts as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
payments are generally made to dealers twice each year  in the first quarter and the third quarter  subject to previously established criteria 
polaris recorded accrued liabilities of million and million for dealer holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
product warranties polaris provides a limited warranty for atvs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for its snowmobiles  and motorcycles 
polaris may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs  as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions 
polaris standard warranties require the company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the warranty reserve was million 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
polaris self insures its product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and the company had accruals of million and million  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes the product liability reserve is adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against the company could have a material adverse effect on polaris financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements polaris implemented financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities during the third quarter this was an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements and addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities by businesses 
polaris used the guidelines in fin to analyze the company s relationships  including the relationship with polaris acceptance  and concluded that the company has no variable interest entities in  and in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments sfas no 
r eg stock options granted to employees 
this applies to all transactions involving the issuance of the company s equity in exchange for goods or services  including employee services 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  all stock option awards to employees will be recognized as expense in the income statement  typically over the requisite service period 
sfas no 
r carried forward the guidance from sfas no 
for payment transactions with non employees 
the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date in april  to require public companies to adopt the standard as of the first annual period beginning after june  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate the historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures for all prior periods presented 
polaris is adopting sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year  using the modified retrospective method and will continue to value options using the black scholes merton valuation model  incorporating key assumptions on volatility and expected option lives based on analysis of historical indicators 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 polaris generally recognizes no compensation expense for employee stock options 
assuming the company had adopted sfas no 
r for fiscal year  pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would have been reduced by per diluted share from per diluted share to per diluted share 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method under sfas no 
r in the first quarter of will have an impact on the company s reported consolidated earnings from operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to result in a charge to full year earnings of approximately to per diluted share 
however  the total expense recorded in future periods will depend on several variables  including the number of share based awards granted  the number of grants that ultimately vest  and the fair value assigned to those awards
