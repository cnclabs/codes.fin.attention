the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
management believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include its allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill  capitalization of direct response advertising costs and self insurance liabilities 
allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains valuation allowances based upon the expected collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables and changes in customer payment patterns 
at december   the company had accounts and notes receivable of million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on net income 
the company actively manages its accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
inventory valuation 
in order to state inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market  the company maintains an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory based upon the expectation that some inventory will become obsolete and be sold for less than cost or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as age of the inventory and historical trends 
at december   the company had inventory of million  net of an allowance of million 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin  and net income 
the company actively manages its inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss and has consistently achieved a high level of inventory turnover 
goodwill 
the company performs an impairment test of its goodwill based on its reporting units as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis 
in performing the impairment test  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which can include multiples of the units earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  present value of expected cash flows and quoted market prices 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current market capitalizations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies 
the fair value of each reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
the company s goodwill totaled million at december  the impairment review required by sfas requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
the application of alternative assumptions  such as different discount rates or ebitda multiples  or the testing for impairment at a different level of organization or on a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
direct response advertising costs 
beginning with the acquisition of access on january   the company defers those costs of direct response advertising of its direct to consumer diabetic supplies that meet the capitalization requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on advertising costs 
the company currently amortizes these costs over a four year period on an accelerated basis 
the company s ability to realize the value of these assets is evaluated periodically by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets to the future net revenues expected to result from sales to customers obtained through the advertising 
at december   deferred direct response advertising costs of million  net of accumulated amortization of million  were included in other assets  net on the consolidated balance sheet 
the ability to capitalize direct response advertising costs depends on the continued success of campaigns to generate future net revenues 
the company estimates the future net revenues expected to result from sales to customers obtained through its advertising based on its past experience with similar campaigns 
an adverse change in the ability of the company s direct response advertising campaigns to generate future net revenues could result in an impairment of previously capitalized costs and cause future costs to be expensed as incurred 
self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for most employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs 
the company estimates its liabilities for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
liabilities for workers compensation and automobile liability claims are estimated using historical claims data and loss development factors provided by outside actuaries 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or reductions to expense that could be material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
self insurance liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet for employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs totaled million at december  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  which addresses how a business enterprise should account for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage incurred in the production and acquisition of inventory 
the provisions of sfas require that these costs be recognized as current period charges  rather than as inventory cost 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of this standard beginning on january  management does not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the provisions of sfas require that all exchanges of nonmonetary assets that have commercial substance be recorded at fair value 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of this standard beginning on january  management does not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r also supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r has since been amended by fasb staff position fsp sfas r  classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued in exchange for employee services under fasb statement no 
r  fsp sfas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r  and fsp sfas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
sfas r  as amended  requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  while sfas as originally issued provided the option of recognizing share based payments based on their fair values or based on their intrinsic values with pro forma disclosure of the effect of recognizing the payments based on their fair values 
as a result of final rule release no 
of the united states securities and exchange commission  the company will be required to adopt the provisions of this standard beginning on january   instead of july   as previously disclosed 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently uses the intrinsic value method as defined by apb to account for share based payments 
as a result  the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  although it will not affect the company s overall financial position 
as the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods will depend on the levels of future grants  the effect of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the effect of adoption would have approximated the effect of using the fair value method  as defined in sfas  to account for share based payment as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as financing cash flows  rather than as operating cash flows as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  as they depend on a number of factors including the timing of employee exercises of stock options and the value of the company s stock at the date of those exercises 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the amount of cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions would have been million  million and million for  and in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
the provisions of sfas require retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change
