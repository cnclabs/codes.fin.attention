item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources contained within this form k is more clearly understood when read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the historical financial statements of our predecessor  origen financial llc  as well as the related notes 
the notes to the financial statements provide information about us and origen financial llc  as well as the basis for presentation used in this form k 
the historical financial statements of origen financial llc  our predecessor company  represent combined financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the business  financial statements and results of operations of origen financial llc are quantitatively different from ours 
origen financial llc s results of operations reflect capital constraints and corporate and business strategies which are different than ours 
we also have elected to be taxed as a reit 
accordingly  we believe the historical financial results of our predecessor company  origen financial llc  are not indicative of our future performance 
overview in october  we began operations upon the completion of a private placement of million of our common stock to certain institutional and accredited investors 
in february   we completed another private placement of million of our common stock to one institutional investor 
in connection with and as a condition to the october private placement  we acquired all of the equity interests of origen financial llc we also took steps to qualify origen financial  inc as a reit 
in the second quarter of  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
currently  most of our operations are conducted through origen financial llc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
we conduct the rest of our business operations through our other wholly owned subsidiaries  including taxable reit subsidiaries  to take advantage of certain business opportunities and ensure that we comply with the federal income tax rules applicable to reits 
the results of our operations for the year ended december   were materially impacted by the damage inflicted by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita on broad regions of louisiana and mississippi and to a lesser extent in alabama and texas 
the recognition of the estimated financial impact from the effects of the hurricanes resulted in charges against earnings of approximately million comprised of a million addition to the allowance for credit losses  a  impairment of a previously purchased loan pool and a  write down of our residual interest in our a securitization 
homes of many of our borrowers were destroyed or damaged 
jobs were lost due to the destruction of businesses or the dislocation of the workforce 
we will incur losses arising from defaults by borrowers who have lost or will lose their employment 
in addition  we will incur losses due to shortfalls in insurance coverage primarily relating to flood damage to homes that were not in flood zones and had no flood insurance 
in estimating these losses  management used all available data and its judgment based on last year s hurricane damage experience 
while extreme effort and thought was exercised by management in the preparation of those estimates  such estimates are inherently imprecise given the difficulty of gathering comprehensive data as a result of the inability to contact displaced borrowers  the difficulty in accessing some portions of the affected area and the uncertainty of the insurance coverage issues centered on the determination of wind versus water damage 
we will continue to gather and interpret data from the affected areas and compare such information to our estimates 
amounts will be refined as deemed appropriate 
observed trends in the performance of the identified loans through december  and continuing through february   have been consistent with management s initial expectations  however  there can be no assurance that the loss provisions will prove to be adequate 

table of contents despite difficult industry conditions  we experienced a increase in loan origination volume in as compared to although total shipments of manufactured houses increased approximately in as compared to  approximately and of the total shipments in and  respectively  were for the federal emergency management agency fema 
as a result  there was an approximately decrease in non fema related manufactured housing shipments in as compared to fema shipments produce no financing opportunities for lenders such as origen 
furthermore our portfolio performance  as measured by delinquencies  continued to improve as loans or more days delinquent decreased from of the loan portfolio at december  to at december  additionally  we have experienced improvements in recovery rates on the re marketing of repossessed or foreclosed assets 
the execution of our securitizations has continued to improve  as we have seen overcollateralization levels in our securitizations fall from for our a securitization to for our b securitization 
however  rising interest rates  the flattening yield curve and competition have prevented us from raising rates and as a result we have seen decreases in our interest rate margin 
in the past we have distributed amounts in excess of our reit taxable income 
return of capital represented and of distributions in and  respectively 
in the future  management intends to pay out at least of our reit taxable income  but not more than of our reit taxable income 
amounts distributed through the third quarter of  relating to our tax year  were sufficient to satisfy this policy 
as a result  we did not and will not make a distribution related to the fourth quarter of we believe that it is more efficient to retain the capital for use in operations as opposed to returning capital and increasing our need to borrow funds for operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to reserves for credit losses  recourse liabilities  servicing rights and retained interests in loans sold and securitized 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under conditions different from our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents transfers of financial assets we engage in securitizations of our manufactured housing loan receivables 
securitizations may take the form of a loan sale or a financing 
we structured all loan securitizations occurring prior to as loan sales and all loan securitizations in and later as financings for accounting purposes 
in the future  we intend to structure and account for our securitizations as financings 
when a loan securitization is structured as a financing  the financed asset remains on our books along with the recorded liability that evidences the financing 
income from both the loan interest spread and the servicing fees received on the securitized loans are recorded into income as earned 
an appropriate allowance for credit losses is maintained on the loans 
when a loan securitization is structured as a loan sale  such as our pre transactions  any gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when control of the transferred financial asset is relinquished by the seller 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  certain assets and income are recorded based upon the difference between all principal and interest received from the loans sold and the following factors i all principal and interest required to be passed through to the asset backed bond investors  ii all excess contractual servicing fees  iii other recurring fees and iv an estimate of losses on loans 
at the time of the sale these amounts are estimated based upon a declining principal balance of the underlying loans  adjusted by an estimated prepayment and loss rate  and such amounts are capitalized using a discount rate that market participants would use for similar financial instruments 
these capitalized assets are recorded as retained interests in loans sold and securitized and capitalized servicing rights 
we assess the carrying value of any retained interests for impairment on a monthly basis 
any subsequent changes in fair value of the retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
there can be no assurance that our estimates used to determine the value of retained interests and the servicing asset valuations will remain appropriate for the life of the securitization 
loans receivable loans receivable consist of manufactured housing loans under contracts collateralized by the borrowers manufactured houses and in some instances  related land 
all loans receivable are classified as held for investment and are carried at amortized cost  except for loans purchased with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  which are described below 
interest on loans is credited to income when earned 
loans receivable include accrued interest and are presented net of deferred loan origination costs and an allowance for estimated loan losses 
allowance for credit losses determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment 
the process of estimating the allowance for credit losses may result in either a specific amount representing the impairment estimate or a range of possible amounts 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on accounting for credit losses associated with pools of loans and requires the accrual of a loss when it is probable that an asset has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loan portfolio is comprised of manufactured housing loans with an average loan balance of less than  the allowance for credit losses is developed at the portfolio level and the amount of the allowance is determined by applying a probability weighting to a calculated range of losses 
a lower range of probable losses is calculated by applying historical loss rate factors to the loan portfolio on a stratified basis using current portfolio performance and delinquency levels days  days  days and greater than days delinquent 
an upper range of probable losses is calculated by the extrapolation of probable loan impairment based on the correlation of historical losses by vintage year of origination 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 states that a creditor should recognize the amount that is the best estimate within the estimated range of credit losses 
accordingly  our application of probability weighting to the calculated range of losses is in recognition of the fact that historical charge off experience  without adjustment  may not be representative of current impairment of the current portfolio of loans because of changed circumstances 
such changes may relate to changes in the age of loans in the portfolio  changes in the creditor s underwriting standards  changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers in a geographic region  or changes in the business climate in a particular industry 

table of contents loan pools and debt securities acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality we account for loan pools and debt securities acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality at the time of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa practice bulletin pb  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans  as well as the aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the carrying values of such purchased loan pools and debt securities were approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december   and are included in loans receivable and investments held to maturity  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet 
we adopted the provisions of sop in january and apply those provisions to loan pools and debt securities acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend pb for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to receivables acquired before january  purchased loans and debt instruments acquired before january  will continue to be accounted for under pb  as amended  for provisions related to decreases in expected cash flows 
under the provisions of sop  each static pool of loans and debt securities is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows 
we consider historical cash collections for loan pools and debt securities with similar characteristics as well as expected prepayments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows for each pool of loans and debt security 
an internal rate of return is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows and applied to the balance of the static pool 
the resulting revenue recognized is based on the internal rate of return applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the internal rate of return is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
beginning january  if revised cash flow estimates are less than the original estimates  sop requires that the internal rate of return remain unchanged and an immediate impairment be recognized 
for loans acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality  if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  sop requires reversal of the previously recognized impairment before any increases to the internal rate of return are made 
for any remaining increases in estimated future cash flows for loan pools or debt securities acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality  we adjust the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan pool or debt security 
application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates to calculate a projected internal rate of return for each pool 
these estimates are based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than projected cash collections  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected cash collections will have a favorable impact on yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected cash collections will have an unfavorable impact and result in an immediate impairment being recognized 
derivative financial instruments we have periodically used derivative instruments  including forward sales of us treasury securities  us treasury rate locks and forward interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk related to our loans receivable and anticipated securitizations 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 

all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  we designate the derivative as a hedge of either a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow to be paid cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified  designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow and are then reported in current earnings 
any ineffectiveness is recorded in current earnings 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction 
this process includes linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow 

table of contents we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of hedged items 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively  in accordance with sfas derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings 
stock options in connection with our formation  we adopted a stock option plan 
we have elected to measure compensation cost using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective january   we will begin measuring compensation cost under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under this pronouncement  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  are treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
the expense of the award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date 
the fair value of each option granted would be determined using a binomial option pricing model based on assumptions related to annualized dividend yield  stock price volatility  risk free rate of return and expected average term 
we plan to adopt the new rules reflected in sfas r using the modified prospective method 
we have determined that the impact of the adoption of sfas r will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill impairment the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require that recorded goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the initial and on going estimate of our fair value is based on our assumptions and projections 
once determined  the amount is compared to our net book value to determine if a write down in the recorded value of the goodwill is necessary 
real estate investment trust as a real estate investment trust  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes if we meet minimum distribution  income  asset and shareholder tests 
however  some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes 
an income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable reit subsidiaries 
a deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in gaap versus tax income for items such as the allowance for loan losses  depreciation  stock based compensation and goodwill amortization 
no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded at december  and due to taxable losses for the reit taxable subsidiaries 
financial condition december  compared to december  at december  and we held loans representing approximately million and million of principal balances  respectively 
net loans outstanding constituted over and of our total assets at december  and  respectively 
approximately million of the loans on our balance sheet at december  were included in our may and december public securitizations  and will continue to be carried on our balance sheet as both securitization transactions were structured as financings 
to the extent loans on our balance sheet are eligible on an individual basis and not already included in our securitized pools  we plan to securitize such loans and issue asset backed bonds through periodic transactions in the asset backed securitization market 
the timing of any securitization will depend on prevailing market conditions and the availability of sufficient total loan balances to constitute an efficient transaction 
new loan originations for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  we additionally processed million and million in loans originated under third party origination agreements for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increased market share resulting from our focus on customer service and the use of technology to deliver our products and services 

table of contents in connection with our estimate of the effect of the impact of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita we identified approximately loans with a total outstanding principal balance of approximately million in areas affected by the hurricanes 
during the year ended december   based on our analysis of the effects of the hurricanes  we included an additional million in the provision for credit losses  recognized an impairment of million in the carrying value of a previously purchased loan pool and recorded a million write off of our residual interest in the a securitization 
the carrying amount of loans receivable consisted of the following at december in thousands manufactured housing loans securitized manufactured housing loans unsecuritized accrued interest receivable deferred fees discount on purchased loans allowance for purchased loans allowance for loan loss the following table sets forth the average individual loan balance  weighted average loan yield  and weighted average initial term at december dollars in thousands number of loans receivable average loan balance weighted average loan coupon a weighted average initial term years years a the weighted average loan coupon includes an imbedded servicing fee rate resulting from securitization or sale of the loan  but accounted for as a financing 
delinquency statistics for the loan receivable portfolio at december are as follows dollars in thousands no 
of principal of no 
of principal of days delinquent loans balance portfolio loans balance portfolio greater than we define non performing loans as those loans that are or more days delinquent in contractual principal payments 
the average balance of non performing loans was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
non performing loans as a percentage of average outstanding principal balance were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents the improvement in our asset quality statistics for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflects our continued emphasis on the credit quality of our borrowers and the improved underwriting and origination practices we have put into place 
continued improvement in delinquency statistics and recovery rates are expected to result in lower levels of non performing assets and net charge offs 
however  due to the limited time that has elapsed since hurricane katrina and hurricane rita we have not seen the full effects of the hurricanes on charge offs or delinquencies 
in the short term  it is likely that charge offs and delinquencies will increase as a result of the hurricanes  however  in the long term  lower levels of non performing assets and net charge offs should have a positive effect on earnings through decreases in the provision for credit losses and servicing expenses as well as increases in net interest income 
at december  we held repossessed houses owned by us compared to houses at december   a decrease of houses  or 
the book value of these houses  including repossession expenses  based on the lower of cost or market value  was approximately million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the allowance for credit losses increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the allowance includes approximately million of estimated losses related to the effects of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
excluding the impact of the hurricanes  the allowance for credit losses increased million 
despite the increase in the gross loans receivable balance  net of loans accounted for under sop  the allowance for credit losses excluding the provision for the hurricanes increased just due to improvement in delinquency rates at december  loans delinquent over days decreased million or from million at december  to million at december  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross loans receivable  net of loans accounted for under sop  was approximately at december  compared to approximately at december  excluding the provision related to the hurricanes  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross loans receivable  net of loans accounted for under sop  was approximately at december  net charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  changes to our underwriting practices  processes  credit scoring models  systems and servicing techniques in have resulted in demonstrably superior performance by loans originated in and subsequent to as compared to loans originated by our predecessors prior to the pre loans  despite representing a diminishing percentage of our owned loan portfolio  have had a disproportionate impact on our financial performance 

table of contents the following tables indicate the impact of such legacy loans loan pool unpaid principle balance dollars in thousands and and prior subsequent at december  dollars percentage of total at december  dollars percentage of total at december  dollars percentage of total static pool performance dollars in thousands and and prior subsequent dollars defaulted net recovery percentage net losses dollars defaulted net recovery percentage net losses dollars defaulted net recovery percentage net losses while representing less than of the owned loan portfolio at december   the pre loans accounted for almost of the defaults during additionally  recovery rates were substantially lower for the pre loans leading to higher losses as compared to loans from and subsequent 
management believes that as these loans become a smaller percentage of the owned loan portfolio  the negative impact on earnings will diminish 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  origen servicing  inc  we provide loan servicing for manufactured housing loans that we and our predecessors have originated or purchased  and for loans originated by third parties 
as of december  we serviced approximately billion of loans  consisting of approximately million of loans serviced for others 
included in the loans serviced for others are million of loans that we or our predecessors originated and subsequently sold in two pre securitization transactions 
as part of our contractual services  certain of our servicing contracts require us to advance uncollected principal and interest payments at a prescribed cut off date each month to an appointed trustee on behalf of the investors in the loans 
we are reimbursed by the trust in the event such delinquent principal and interest payments remain uncollected during the next reporting period 
also  as part of the servicing function  in order to protect the value of the housing asset underlying the loan  we are required to advance certain expenses such as taxes  insurance costs and costs related to the foreclosure or repossession process as necessary 
such expenditures are reported to the appropriate trustee for reimbursement 
at december   we had servicing advances outstanding of approximately million compared to million at december   a decrease of 
includes owned portfolio  repossessed inventory and loans sold with recourse 

table of contents as a result of the acquisition of origen financial llc  our predecessor company  on october   which was accounted for as a purchase  we recorded the net assets acquired at fair value  which resulted in recording goodwill of million 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the year ended december  in the past  our predecessor companies sold loans with recourse 
we regularly evaluate the recourse liability for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as changes in outstanding principal balance of the portfolios of loans sold with recourse  trends in actual and forecasted portfolio performance  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to pay 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our liability accordingly 
in july  we negotiated a buy out of our recourse obligation with vanderbilt mortgage and finance  inc vanderbilt 
at the time of the buy out the remaining principal balance and recourse liability related to the loans sold to vanderbilt was approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of the buyout  we no longer will be required to take as a charge against earnings  over the remaining life of the loan pool  the difference between the book amount of the recourse liability  which was based on net present value  and the then current dollars paid out to satisfy the recourse requirement 
the buy out  which eliminated all loan recourse with vanderbilt  was consummated on july   and resulted in a charge against earnings of approximately million 
the provision for recourse liability was approximately  for the year ended december  at december   the reserve for loan recourse liability was million as compared to million at december   a decrease of 
the remaining principal balance of loans sold with recourse at december  was million versus million at december   a decrease of 
bonds outstanding  relating to securitized financings utilizing asset backed structures  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these bonds relate to four securitized transactions origen a  issued in may  origen b  issued in december  origen a  issued in february and origen b  issued in september bonds outstanding for each securitized transaction were as follows at december in thousands original issuance origen a origen b origen a origen b at december  our total borrowings under our short term securitization arrangement with citigroup global markets realty corporation citigroup were million compared to million at december  we use the citigroup facility to fund loans we originate or purchase until such time as they can be included in one of our securitization transactions 
we used the proceeds of our may and december public securitizations to reduce borrowings outstanding on the citigroup facility 
we currently have a revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na under the terms of the facility we can borrow up to million for the purpose of funding required principal and interest advances on manufactured housing loans that are serviced for outside investors 
borrowings under the facility are repaid upon our collection of monthly payments made by borrowers on such manufactured housing loans

chattel loans comprised approximately of loans originated in both and the balance of loans originated  in each year  were land home loans  which represent manufactured housing loans that are additionally collateralized by real estate 
interest income on loans increased million  from million to million  or 
this increase in interest income resulted primarily from an increase in the average outstanding balance of manufactured housing loan receivables of million from million to million  or 
the increase in the average receivable balance was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on the portfolio from to 
the decrease in the yield on the portfolio was due to competitive conditions resulting in lower interest rates on new originations and a continuing positive change in the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
generally  higher credit quality loans will carry a lower interest rate 
interest income on other interest earning assets increased from million to million 
the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in interest income on asset back security investments  which are collateralized by manufactured housing loans 
investments in such securities amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest expense increased million  or  to million from million 
the majority of our interest expense relates to interest on our loan funding facilities 
average debt outstanding on our loan funding facilities increased million to million compared to million  or 
the average interest rate on total debt outstanding increased from to 
the higher average interest rate for the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in the base libor rate

net charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of average outstanding principal balance total net charge offs decreased to compared to 
we expect net charge offs  excluding hurricane losses  as a percentage of average outstanding principal balance to continue to decrease in the future due to the fact that the owned portfolio of loans at december  has a larger concentration of loans originated in the years through than was the case for the owned portfolio at december  we expect this to be partially offset by increased charge offs resulting from hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
an impairment of million in the carrying value of a previously purchased loan pool was recognized during as a result of the hurricanes 
non interest income for year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for year  an increase of 
the primary components of non interest income are fees and other income from loan servicing and insurance operations

loan origination and servicing expenses increased million  or from million to million 
the increase is directly related to an increase in loan originations from million to million  and an increase in the servicing portfolio from billion to billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increased market share resulting from our focus on customer service and the use of technology to deliver our products and services 

table of contents the provision for recourse liability decreased million  or from million to million as a result of our buy out of our recourse obligation with vanderbilt 
as a result of the buyout  we no longer will be required to take as a charge against earnings  over the remaining life of the loan pool  the difference between the book amount of the recourse liability  which was based on net present value  and the then current dollars paid out to satisfy the recourse requirement 
write down of residual interest increased million due to the write off of our residual interest in the a securitization as a result of the effects of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
securitized loan transactions completed during years and were structured as loan sales for accounting purposes 
as a result  our predecessor companies recorded an asset representing their residual interests in the loans at the time of sale  based on the discounted values of the projected cash flows over the expected life of the loans sold 
during the year ended december   we wrote off our remaining million residual interest in the a securitization as a result of the effects of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
since  neither we nor our predecessor has structured a securitization transaction in a manner requiring gain on sale treatment  nor is it our intention to do so in the future

the increase was primarily the result of purchases during of asset backed securities  which are collateralized by manufactured housing loans 
investments in such securities amounted to million at december  other interest earning assets in consisted primarily of restricted cash in the form of servicing related escrow accounts 
interest expense increased to million from million  or 
average interest bearing liabilities increased from million to million 
however the interest rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased from to 
in the absence of other capital sources prior to the million private placement of our common stock in october  it was necessary to rely on high cost  short term borrowed funds 
the historically low rates on loan funding facilities accessed during were partially offset by the continued use of high cost borrowings to fund shortfalls in cash from operations through october  our capital position improved in as a result of our private placement and initial public offering of common stock in may and our february and september securitizations

the provision for credit losses increased million  or  from million to million 
the increase is primarily related to the increase in the outstanding principal balance of the loan portfolio through new loan originations offset by charge offs 
however  our provision for mortgage loan losses has not increased at the same rate as our mortgage loan portfolio due to the improved credit quality and reduced charge offs of our new originations 
delinquency rates on more recent vintage year loans have shown consistent improvement 
at december   of our owned loan portfolio was originated after december   compared with at december  this is significant because in we introduced a significantly improved internally developed credit scoring model  tng  and implemented new underwriting procedures around this model  both of which greatly improved the quality of our loan originations 
non interest income for year totaled million as compared to million for year  an increase of 
the primary components of non interest income are fees and other income from loan servicing and insurance operations 
loan servicing fees comprised approximately of non interest income in and approximately in  reflecting the overall increase in the serviced loan portfolio 
servicing fees were negatively impacted  however  during due to a subordination to bond investors of the payment of our servicing fees from our a securitization transaction 
in march  due to greater than originally anticipated losses in the a loan pool  the over collateralization of the a bonds fell below the contractual requirement  which triggered the subordination of our servicing fee 
the negative impact of this subordination of servicing fees for was a reduction in servicing fee income of approximately  
table of contents total non interest expense for was million as compared to million for following is a discussion of the decrease of million  or 
total personnel expenses increased million or from million to million 
salaries and commissions increased  from million to million as a result of the increase during in the average number of full time employee equivalents from to  the cost of a december reduction in force of approximately of our authorized positions  and increased commissions due to increased sales 
the expenses incurred in relation to the reduction in force consisted primarily of severance payments and employee relocation costs 
as a consequence of the reduction in force  it was necessary to require several employees to relocate in response to changed responsibilities 
the cost of the reduction in force and related relocations was approximately  the most significant increase in personnel expense in resulted from stock compensation expenses incurred under our equity incentive plan 
this non cash expense increased from million in to million in the plan did not go into effect until the last quarter of  following our october million private placement of common stock 
the number of shares of common stock granted under the equity incentive plan increased from  to  the cost of the stock grants is being amortized over the related service periods 
the increase in salaries and stock compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in total bonus expense of million 
of the million of bonus expense in   related to quarterly incentive payments  primarily to non management personnel 
for  approximately million of the total bonus expense of million related to such non annual payments 
loan origination and servicing expenses increased million  or to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was directly related to the increase in loan originations to million from million and an increase in the servicing portfolio to billion from billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in these costs was partially mitigated by the consolidation of the majority of our origination operations in southfield  michigan and the consolidation and streamlining of much of our repossession operations in our fort worth  texas offices in in the fourth quarter  million was added  through a charge against earnings  to the provision for losses on loans sold with recourse 
no additional provision for loan recourse losses was made in year the primary reason for the increase to the provision for losses related to a pool of loans sold  with full recourse  by our predecessor in during the fourth quarter of  this pool of loans experienced actual losses in excess of those estimated previously  largely due  in our estimation  to the difficult economy in michigan during and the effect of the hurricanes of the loans in the pool included a significant amount of michigan originations and the difficult michigan economy caused an increase in late stage delinquencies 
the increased loss provision was based on an increase in the estimated cumulative life time losses on the remaining loans in the pool and the resulting impact on the calculated present value of expected future obligations 
the original pool balance was million 
the pool balance at december  is million 
securitized loan transactions completed during years and were structured as loan sales for accounting purposes 
as a result  our predecessor companies recorded an asset representing residual interests in the loans at the time of sale  based on the discounted values of the projected cash flows over the expected life of the loans sold 
due to deterioration beginning in and accelerating in in the credit performance of these sold loans as compared to the initially projected performance  it was necessary to adjust the carrying value of these residual interests by  in compared to a write down of million in the remaining residual balance at december  was approximately as a national loan originator and servicer of manufactured housing loans  we are required to be licensed in all states in which we conduct business 
accordingly  we are subject to taxation by the states in which we conduct business 
depending on the individual state  taxes may be based on proportioned revenue  net income  capital base or asset base 
in we incurred state taxes of  as compared to  in other operating expenses  which consist of occupancy and equipment  professional fees  travel and entertainment and miscellaneous expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from million to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million in other operating expenses  the details of which are discussed below 

table of contents occupancy and equipment  office expense and telephone expense decreased by a total of approximately million  or  from million to primarily as a result of consolidating a significant amount of our loan origination functions to southfield  michigan in april professional fees decreased million  or  from million to million 
the primary reasons for the decrease related to a reduction in the use of outside professionals and consultants that were used prior to october as we attempted to raise capital  undertook certain licensing efforts  pursued several information technology initiatives and incurred various other legal expenses 
travel and entertainment and miscellaneous expenses decreased approximately million from million to million 
the decrease was primarily the result of million in costs associated with minority interests in  offset by an increase of approximately million in director and officer liability insurance related to our formation as a reit in october and our becoming a publicly traded company following our initial public offering in may liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund our loan originations  acquire manufactured housing loans originated by third parties and expand our loan servicing operations 
at december  we had approximately million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we will be required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income as defined in the internal revenue code to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash provided from operations and external sources of capital 
historically  we have satisfied our liquidity needs through cash generated from operations  sales of our common and preferred stock  borrowings on our credit facilities and securitizations 
cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december   totaled million versus cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  cash used to originate and purchase loans increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increased origination volume is a result of increased market share resulting from our focus on customer service and the use of technology to deliver our products and services 
principal collections on loans totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in collections is primarily related to the increase in the average outstanding loan portfolio balance  which was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   in addition to improved credit quality and decreased delinquency as a percentage of outstanding loan receivable balance 
the primary source of cash during the year ended december  was approximately million in net proceeds from two securitized financing transactions  one completed in may and the other completed in december proceeds from the securitizations were used primarily to pay down the aggregate balances of the notes outstanding under our loan funding facility with citigroup 
on may   we completed our a securitized financing transaction for approximately million in principle balance of manufactured housing loans  which was funded by issuing bonds of approximately million 
net proceeds from the transaction totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was used to reduce the aggregate balances of notes outstanding under our citigroup warehouse financing 
on december   we completed our b securitized financing transaction for approximately million in principle balance of manufactured housing loans  which was funded by issuing bonds of approximately million 
net proceeds from the transaction totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was used to reduce the aggregate balances of notes outstanding under our citigroup warehouse financing 

table of contents continued access to the securitization market is very important to our business 
the proceeds from successful securitization transactions generally are applied to paying down our other short term credit facilities giving us renewed borrowing capacity to fund new loan originations 
numerous factors affect our ability to complete a successful securitization  including factors beyond our control 
these include general market interest rate levels  the shape of the yield curve and spreads between rates on us treasury obligations and securitized bonds  all of which affect investors demand for securitized debt 
in the event these factors are unfavorable our ability to successfully complete securitization transactions is impeded and our liquidity and capital resources are affected negatively 
there can be no assurance that current favorable conditions will continue or that unfavorable conditions will not return 
we currently have a short term securitization facility used for warehouse financing with citigroup 
under the terms of the agreement  originally entered into in march and amended periodically  most recently in april  we pledge loans as collateral and in turn we are advanced funds 
the facility has a maximum advance amount of million  an advance rate equal to approximately of the unpaid principal balance of the pool of loans pledged and an annual interest rate equal to libor plus a spread 
additionally  the facility includes a million supplemental advance amount that is collateralized by our residual interests in the a  b  a and b securitizations 
the facility matures on march  the outstanding balance on the facility was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
it is anticipated that the facility will be renewed with terms no less favorable than the current terms 
we currently have four separate repurchase agreements with citigroup 
three of the repurchase agreements are for the purpose of financing the purchase of investments in three asset backed securities with principal balances of million  million and million respectively 
the fourth repurchase agreement is for the purpose of financing our residual interest in the b securitization with a principal balance of million 
under the terms of the agreements we sell our interest in the securities and residual interests with an agreement to repurchase them at a predetermined future date at the principal amount sold plus an interest component 
the securities are financed at an amount equal to of their current market value as determined by citigroup 
typically the repurchase agreements are rolled over for day periods when they expire 
the annual interest rates on the agreements are equal to libor plus a spread 
the repurchase agreements had outstanding principal balances of approximately million  million  million and million at december   and million  million  and  at december  we currently have a revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na under the terms of the facility we can borrow up to million to fund required principal and interest advances on manufactured housing loans that we service for outside investors 
borrowings under the facility are repaid when we collect monthly payments made by borrowers under such manufactured housing loans 
the bank s prime interest rate is payable on the outstanding balance 
to secure the loan  we have granted jpmorgan chase a security interest in substantially all our assets excluding securitized assets 
the expiration date of the facility is december  the outstanding balance on the facility was approximately million at december  there was no outstanding balance at december  in september  the securities and exchange commission declared effective our shelf registration statement on form s for the proposed offering  from time to time  of up to million of our common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
in addition to such debt securities  preferred stock and other common stock we may sell under the registration statement from time to time  we have registered for sale  shares of our common stock pursuant to a sales agreement that we have entered into with brinson patrick securities corporation 
it is anticipated that these shares of common stock will be sold at the price of our common stock prevailing at the time of sale 

table of contents in addition to borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of securitized notes  we have fixed contractual obligations under various lease agreements 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands less than total year years years thereafter notes payable citigroup notes payable a securitization notes payable b securitization notes payable a securitization notes payable b securitization repurchase agreement operating leases total contractual obligations origen financial llc and origen securitization company  llc  one of our special purpose entity subsidiaries  are borrowers under the short term securitization facility with citigroup 
origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust a  is the issuer of the notes payable under the a securitization 
origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust b  is the issuer of the notes payable under the b securitization 
origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust a  is the issuer of the notes payable under the a securitization 
origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust b  is the issuer of the notes payable under the b securitization 
origen financial llc is the borrower under the citigroup repurchase agreement 
our long term liquidity and capital requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to originate and hold manufactured housing loans  acquire and hold manufactured housing loans originated by third parties and expand our loan servicing operations 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations  but we will require external sources of capital  which may include sales of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  convertible debt securities and third party borrowings either pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s or otherwise 
we intend to continue to access the asset backed securities market for the long term financing of our loans in order to match the interest rate risk between our loans and the related long term funding source 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs depends on numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include general capital market and economic conditions  general market interest rate levels  the shape of the yield curve and spreads between rates on us treasury obligations and securitized bonds  all of which affect investors demand for equity and debt securities  including securitized debt securities 
cash generated from operations  borrowings under our citigroup facility  loan securitizations  borrowings against our securitized loan residuals  convertible debt  equity interests or additional debt financing arrangements either pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s or otherwise will enable us to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months depending on market conditions which may affect loan origination volume  loan purchase opportunities and the availability of securitizations 
if market conditions require  loan purchase opportunities become available  or favorable capital opportunities become available  we may seek additional funds through additional credit facilities or additional sales of our common or preferred stock 

table of contents the risks associated with the manufactured housing business become more acute in any economic slowdown or recession 
periods of economic slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining asset values 
in the manufactured housing business  any material decline in collateral values increases the loan to value ratios of loans previously made  thereby weakening collateral coverage and increasing the size of losses in the event of default 
delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
for our finance customers  loss of employment  increases in cost of living or other adverse economic conditions would impair their ability to meet their payment obligations 
higher industry inventory levels of repossessed manufactured houses may affect recovery rates and result in future impairment charges and provision for losses 
in addition  in an economic slowdown or recession  servicing and litigation costs generally increase 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures  losses or increased costs would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments 
we are not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt  under which we paid interest at various libor rates plus a spread  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
if libor increased or decreased by during the years ended december  and  we believe our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had no variable rate interest earning assets outstanding during the years ended december  or the following table shows the contractual maturity dates of our assets and liabilities at december  for each maturity category in the table the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflects an imbalance between re pricing opportunities for the two sides of the balance sheet

in february  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap for the purpose of locking in the designated benchmark interest rate  in this case libor  on a portion of our planned a securitization transaction completed in may under the terms of the swap we paid a fixed rate of and received a floating rate equal to the one month libor rate on a beginning notional balance of million 
the cost to terminate this hedge in may was approximately  this amount will be amortized over the expected life of the securitization transaction 

table of contents in may and september  we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps for the purpose of locking in the designated benchmark interest rate  in this case libor  on a portion of our planned b securitization transaction completed in december these hedging transactions were structured at inception to meet the criteria set forth in sfas in order to allow us to assume that no ineffectiveness exists 
as a result  all changes in the fair value of the derivatives were included in other comprehensive income and began to be amortized over the expected life of the related securitization transaction upon completion of the securitization transaction

under the terms of the swap we will pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate equal to the one month libor rate on a beginning notional balance of million 
the first payment is scheduled for june  a rise in rates during the interim period would increase our borrowing cost in the securitization  but this increase would be offset by the increased value in the right to pay a lower fixed rate during the term of the securitized transaction
