item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes 
executive overview recent market and pricing trends the company s primary markets exhibited continued strong underlying demand throughout consolidated net sales for of million were million  or  higher than excluding the impact of higher material prices  net sales rose nearly 
the aerospace  oil and gas  mining and construction equipment  and truck and railroad equipment sectors were especially robust 
metals material pricing stabilized in as compared to rapid price escalation throughout the metals supply was generally steady and reliable  with the exception of nickel steels  which continue to be rapidly consumed by the aerospace and oil and gas industries 
suppliers delivery lead times stretched in some cases to weeks by year end for certain nickel steels 
the company believes that its strong presence in the nickel steels marketplace niche and its relationships with primary nickel steels suppliers have the company well positioned to competitively service customer demand for these products  which represented of consolidated total net sales 
historically  management has used the purchaser s managers index pmi provided by the institute of supply management website is www 
ism 
ws as a reasonable tracking measure of general demand trends in its customer markets 
table below shows pmi trends from the first quarter of through the final quarter of generally speaking  an index above indicates continuing growth in the manufacturing sector of the us economy 
as the data indicates  the us manufacturing economy is still growing at a modest pace as of year end 
the company s revenue growth  net of material price increases  has improved over this same time period 
table year qtr qtr qtr qtr though the pmi does offer some insight  management typically relies on its relationships with the company s supplier and customer base to assess continuing demand trends 
as of december   indicators generally point to a continued healthy demand for the company s products in the company s plastics segment reported modest underlying sales growth in and more dramatic material price increases than those experienced in the metals segment 
driven by global increases in petroleum based products and the impact of hurricane katrina on the supplier base  plastic material prices rose  on average  an estimated during typically  prices in this business are less volatile than those in the metals markets and are less subjective to the north american manufacturing economic cycles 
however  current price levels are unusually high and may not remain at these levels throughout the next year 
demand for the company s plastic products comes from different markets than those within the metals segment  and tends to be more stable and less cyclical historically 
additionally  the plastics segment has benefited from a sustained program of geographic expansion as four new branches have opened since late current business outlook a favorable year end pmi suggests that demand for the company s products and services should continue at their current high levels at least in the near term 
to date  metals pricing  in the aggregate  for the products the company sells remains stable 
select pricing for nickel sheet has risen during and conversely  certain carbon steel prices have declined  but the overall mix of products within the metals segment resulted in lower price volatility than in as previously mentioned  plastic material prices were at high levels as came to a close 
it is difficult to determine how long they will remain at the year end levels 
the company will 
table of contents continue to assess its growth initiatives for this segment and may consider further geographic expansion alternatives as it has in the last few years 
results of operations year to year comparisons and commentary as described in this management s discussion and analysis under the caption recent accounting pronouncements and in footnote to the financial statements  the company elected to adopt fas r share based payment  on a modified retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of as such  previously reported financial results for and prior years have been restated as a result of this adoption 
the following commentary and comparative financial data reflect these changes 
our discussion of comparative period results is based upon the following components of the company s consolidated statements of operations 
net sales the company derives its revenues from the sale and processing of metals and plastics 
pricing is established with each customer order and includes charges for the material  processing activity and delivery 
the pricing varies by product line and type of processing 
the company does not enter into any long term fixed price arrangements with a customer without obtaining a similar agreement with its suppliers 
cost of material sold cost of material sold consists of the costs we pay for metals  plastics and related inbound freight charges 
the company accounts for inventory on a lifo last in first out basis 
lifo adjustments are calculated as of december of each year 
interim estimates of the year end charge or credit are determined based on inflationary or deflationary purchase cost trends and estimated year end inventory levels 
interim lifo estimates may require significant year end adjustments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements gross material margin gross material margin is defined as net sales less cost of material sold 
historically  the company has been successful in maintaining its margin percentage in periods of increasing and declining material costs 
if material costs increase and the company maintains its margin percentage  it generates more material margin dollars 
conversely  if material costs decline and the company maintains its margin percentage  we generate fewer material margin dollars 
expenses expenses primarily consist of plant and delivery expenses  which include occupancy costs  compensation and employee benefits for warehouse personnel  processing  shipping and handling costs  selling expenses  which include compensation and employee benefits for sales personnel  and general and administrative expenses  which include compensation for executive officers and general management  expenses for professional services primarily attributable to accounting and legal advisory services  data communication and computer hardware and maintenance  and depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation for all owned property and equipment  and amortization of various long lived assets

obligations of the company associated with its leased equipment are disclosed within this filing under the contractual obligations and other commitments section above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s outstanding letters of credit 

table of contents critical accounting policies the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  which necessarily include amounts that are based on estimates and assumptions 
the following is a description of some of the more significant policies inventory substantially all inventories are valued using the last in first out lifo method 
under this method  the current value of material sold is recorded as cost of material sold rather than the actual cost in the order in which it was purchased 
this means that older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals or plastics industry 
the use of lifo for inventory valuation was chosen to better match replacement cost of inventory with the current pricing used to bill customers 
retirement plans the company values retirement plan assets and liabilities based on assumptions and valuations established by management following consultation with its independent actuary 
future valuations are subject to market changes  which are not in the control of the company and could differ materially from the amounts currently reported 
note to the consolidated financial statements disclose the assumptions used by management 
insurance plans the company is self insured for a portion of worker s compensation and automobile insurance 
self insurance amounts are capped for individual claims  and  in the aggregate  for each policy year by an insurance company 
self insurance reserves are based on unpaid  known claims including related administrative fees assessed by the insurance company for claims processing and a reserve for incurred but not reported claims based on the company s historical claim experience and development 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is largely recognized upon shipment whereupon title passes and the company has no further obligations to the customer 
the company has entered into consignment inventory agreements with a few select customers whereby revenue is not recorded until the customer has consumed product from the consigned inventory and title has passed 
revenue derived from consigned inventories at customer locations for was million or of sales compared to million or of sales 
inventory on consignment at customers as of december  was million  or of consolidated net inventory as reported on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  and returns and other adjustments are recorded in the same period the related sales are recorded 
shipping and handling expenses of million  million and million for  and  respectively  were recorded as operating expense in the period incurred 
goodwill impairment the carrying value of goodwill is evaluated annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year or when certain events eg the potential sale of an entity occur which require a more current valuation 
the valuation is based on the comparison of an entity s discounted cash flow equity valuation to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the equity valuation the goodwill is impaired appropriately 
the equity valuation is based on historical data and management assumptions of future cash flow 
since the assumptions are forward looking  actual results could differ materially from those used in the valuation process 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect  using enacted tax rates of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amounts will not be realized 
income tax expense includes provisions for amounts that are currently payable  plus changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation the company offers stock based compensation to executive and other key employees  as well as its directors 
stock based compensation expense is generally recorded using the grant date fair value of the stock award 
for stock option grants  the company determines the grant date fair value of the award with a black scholes valuation model using assumptions for the risk 
table of contents free interest rate  expected term of the option  volatility and expected dividend yield 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the specific assumptions used by management 
the company s long term performance plan generally calculates fair value by reference to the grant date market price of the company s common stock and in recording stock compensation expense  management also must estimate the probable number of shares which will ultimately vest 
the actual number of shares that will vest may differ from management s estimate 
recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent other accounting pronouncements is included in note notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption new accounting standards 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various interest rate and metal price risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company finances its operations with fixed and variable rate borrowings 
market risk arises from changes in variable interest rates 
under its revolver  the company s interest rate on borrowings is subject to changes in the libor and prime rate market fluctuations 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolver 
see note to consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s variable interest rate 
all of the company s long term debt as of december  is on a fixed interest rate 
the company s raw material costs are comprised primarily of engineered metals and plastics 
market risk arises from changes in the price of steel  other metals and plastics 
although average selling prices generally increase or decrease as material costs increase or decrease  the impact of a change in the purchase price of materials is more immediately reflected in the company s cost of goods sold than in its selling prices
