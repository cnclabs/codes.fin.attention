item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  we undertook a significant change in our strategic plan and related business operations by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products 
in july  we sold substantially all of our assets and business related to our chewing gum operations to wrigley 
in december  we acquired the remaining interest of gel tech  making it a wholly owned subsidiary of matrixx 
in july  the name gel tech  llc was changed to zicam  llc 
our financial results reflect our former chewing gum operations as discontinued operations  and consequently these operations are not reflected in the following discussion and analysis 
we report zicam  llc s and zicam swab products  llc s financial results on a consolidated basis 

table of contents our restructuring process continued in as we reincorporated in delaware  changed our name to matrixx initiatives  inc and consolidated our operations in our phoenix office 
moreover  as part of our focus on over the counter pharmaceutical products  we introduced five new zicam nasal gel products in  improved package graphics for the entire zicam product line and engaged a new sales team to represent our products to retailers 
we continued to expand the zicam product line in by introducing three zicam cold remedy oral products chewables  rapidmelts and oral mist 
furthering our growth  we introduced six zicam cough mist products in the third quarter of we increased our offerings again in by introducing an additional zicam cough mist product  four zicam flu relief products  and launching our new nasal comfort brand 
executive summary the company currently markets products within the billion overall cough and cold category at retail 
our zicam products are sold in the cold nasal delivery products and oral delivery products  allergy sinus zicam nasal delivery  cough oral delivery products  and flu oral delivery products market groups of the overall cough and cold category 
our nasal comfort products are generally sold within the space allocated for allergy and sinus products at retail 
we believe nasal comfort will benefit consumers suffering from asthma  allergies  and sinus conditions as well as active lifestyle individuals concerned about respiratory health 
we expect that our mix of products sold will change due to seasonality and varying growth rates within the market groups 
for the year ended december  our mix of products sold units was cold nasal and oral  allergy sinus  cough  flu  and nasal comfort compared to cold  allergy sinus  and cough for the year ending december  our products are currently available at all of the major food  drug  and mass merchant retailers 
the following table details our sales by product class with further details below product class cold remedy allergy sinus cough flu nasal comfort total net sales net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in of million 
approximately of the increase was attributable to sales of flu and nasal comfort products  which include the four new zicam flu relief and two nasal comfort products that we began shipping in august sales of zicam cold remedy products grew and represented approximately of our net sales growth 
additionally  sales of allergy sinus products grew in cough product sales declined approximately in we expect the trend of increasing net sales will continue as we promote consumer awareness of our products  increase distribution of our products  and introduce new items 
the company expects annual net sales will increase over the sales recorded in net income for was approximately million  including the impact of an million million net of tax charge  net of expected recovery from insurance programs  recorded in the fourth quarter for settling the arizona litigation and recording a reserve for the remaining product liability lawsuits see part i  item legal proceedings 
excluding the impact of the settlement charge  reserve  and tax credits  net income for was approximately million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of approximately million in we believe income and earnings excluding the settlement  reserve  and tax credits that were recognized in the fourth quarter of provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis 
investors should note that these non gaap financial measures involve judgments by management  including whether an item is classified as an unusual item 
we use similar concepts to measure our performance internally in reports for management 
we expect net income in future periods will be significantly affected by the level of sales  the timing and amount of our advertising and research and development expenses  and the timing and amount of expenses incurred in the defense of product liability matters 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in than the amounts incurred in the same periods in earlier years 
we expect that advertising expenses will be highest in the fourth and first quarters in conjunction with the cough and cold season 
the company expects annual net income in will grow above the level realized in  exclusive of the unusual items noted in the preceding paragraph 
we anticipate quarterly earnings will continue to vary along with the seasonality of sales and the level of marketing and research and development activities 
as in prior years  we believe the second quarter of will result in a loss 

table of contents in february  the company announced enhancements to the zicam product line for the enhancements include zicam rapidmelt c  a vitamin c enhanced rapidmelt  a rapid dissolve zicam cough melt that capitalizes on our successful quick dissolve technology  and the re launch of the cold remedy swabs utilizing the dry handle swab technology acquired in the third quarter of we continue to direct research and development activities toward introducing products in additional over the counter categories 
the company s management reviews several key performance indicators 
we compare our year to date sales and net income performance against our stated annual goal for each 
for fiscal  our stated goal was to grow sales and net income above the level realized in we realized net sales growth of in as noted previously  net income for reflects recognition of approximately million as expense related to settling the arizona litigation and creating a reserve for the remaining lawsuits  and  in tax credits 
net income grew by exclusive of these one time items 
we monitor our share of the cough and cold market 
for the weeks ended december   retail sales of our products as measured by three outlet syndicated scanner data  not including our largest customer  wal mart increased approximately over the comparable period in the previous year  while the entire cough and cold category increased approximately over the same period 
the increased sales of our products for the weeks ended december  achieved a share of approximately of the entire cough and cold market compared to a share of in the previous year 
we measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products 
during we achieved an average gross margin of  which is below our goal of  and equal to the average gross margin of realized in gross margins on our existing products vary between and 
average gross margins remaining below is primarily attributable to higher start up costs related to new products and increased freight costs 
we evaluate our operating performance by reviewing  over time  our ability to decrease administrative and general costs as a percentage of net sales 
for  our operating expenses excluding r d and litigation settlement charges were approximately of our net sales compared to in operating expenses for the year  as a percentage of net sales  have been positively impacted by operating expense increasing at a lower rate than sales growth 
although we recognized million in for reimbursement of legal expenses  legal expense continues to negatively impact results 
legal expense in increased to million net of the million insurance reimbursement discussed in part i item legal proceedings compared to million in the increased legal expense is primarily related to the product liability lawsuits which have been filed against the company see part i  item legal proceedings 
we review the distribution of our products by key national retailers 
our ten largest retail customers carry  on average  of our products zicam nasal comfort compared to of our products in those customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in  and of net sales in seasonality and quarterly results the products we currently market are seasonal in nature  and sales at retail generally increase as the level of population suffering from colds rises 
the company records sales when we ship products from our warehouse facilities 
during the third quarter  the company usually realizes increased sales volume as retailers stock our products and order displays to prepare for the upcoming cough and cold season 
additional sales re orders to retailers are highly dependent upon the incidence of illness within the population 
retail consumption of our products is highest during the cough and cold season  which usually runs from october through march 
the company begins extensive advertising campaigns to coincide with the cough and cold season and generally realizes higher advertising expense in the fourth and first quarters of each year 
the second quarter of each year generally accounts for less than of annual sales 
further  the company records the expense for annual bonuses and incentive stock awards when goal attainment for the bonus is reached  which is generally reflected in fourth quarter results 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition  accounting for sales returns and allowances associated with our products  accounting for sales discounts and promotional programs  and accounting for legal contingencies 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the zicam  llc interest acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas no 
 goodwill must be tested when a triggering event occurs or at least annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our annual valuation of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of and no impairment was identified 
income taxes due to our significant operating losses prior to  we possessed a tax loss carry forward  which could be used to reduce our taxable income in future periods 
due to a history of operating losses  we recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in and prior years to offset the entire deferred tax asset arising from our tax loss carry forward 
however  due to the significant improvement in our net income in  together with our expectation of continuing profitability in future years  we determined that we were more likely than not to realize the tax benefit associated with our tax loss carry forward 
consequently  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance to zero in the effect of this change was a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million in in and  we recorded income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods 
in  we fully utilized the tax loss carryforward and realized a tax benefit related to realization of approximately  in tax credits 
we expect to incur higher tax payments in future years 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when earned  that is  when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
sales incentives  promotional allowances  and returns are estimated and recognized at the date of shipment based upon historical activity and current agreements with customers 
the company evaluates these estimates on a monthly basis and revises them as necessary 
customer sales returns and allowances the estimate for product returns is based on our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects potential product returns 
our sales returns experience has been consistent with our estimate for returns 
for the first six months of  we recorded a returns provision of of gross sales for the ten zicam products introduced in or earlier and a returns provision of of gross sales for the six zicam cough mist products that began shipping in july in july  we reviewed the return provision for the six zicam cough mist products that began shipping in july and  based on our review and our product return experience  we reduced the return provision from to on sales of these six products occurring after july  currently  we are recording a returns provision of for potential returns and allowances of gross sales for the zicam products introduced in or earlier 
in establishing the appropriate reserve for the new zicam cold flu relief  nasal comfort  and zicam cough mist max products  that began shipping in the third quarter of  we reviewed the similarities and differences of the new products relative to the zicam products for which we now have several years of product return experience 
based on that review we are recording a provision of of gross sales for these products 
we will review the return provision at least quarterly and adjust these reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results could be materially affected 
we expect a higher sales returns allowance will be recorded in the future for new products that we introduce until such products achieve market acceptance 

table of contents legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
see part i  item legal proceedings for information regarding our pending litigation 
while we are vigorously defending ourself in these proceedings  the outcome of these and any other proceedings that may arise cannot be predicted with certainty 
as of december   the company has established a reserve of approximately million solely for any future payment of settlement or losses related to the cold remedy litigation 
this reserve was based on certain assumptions and was the amount that the company believed that it could reasonably estimate would be spent to resolve the remaining cases 
some of the significant factors that were considered in the establishment of the reserve were the actual costs incurred by the company up to that time in resolving several claims  the development of the company s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the recent settlement and the number of cases that remain pending against the company 
there are events  such as the dismissal of any cases  the outcome of a trial  or rulings on pending evidentiary motions  that may have an impact on the company s conclusions as to the adequacy of the reserves for the pending product liability lawsuits 
the company will continue to review the adequacy of the associated reserves on a quarterly basis 
the company followed the guidance of sfas  accounting for contingencies  which states the company is required to accrue a contingent loss when the loss is deemed probable

we believe increased sales of our products are primarily due to greater brand awareness and marketing efforts

we also experienced an increase of million for our general and administrative expenses 
the majority of this increase is due to increased quality control and customer service expense 
we expect expenses in future periods will vary largely in relation to the level of our advertising expenditures  which are heaviest in the first and fourth quarters 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur approximately million to million  per quarter  in legal expense for the zicam cold remedy product liability and securities litigation matters in which we are engaged see part i  item legal proceedings 
the company continues to pursue an agreement with various of its insurers concerning recovery of defense costs relating to these matters 
research and development research and development expense increased from approximately million in to million in we expect to invest to of annual net sales on research and development efforts 
we continue to invest in research and development efforts and remain focused on developing new products 
interest other income other income increased to million in  approximately  higher than the increase is attributable to interest income associated with our increased cash position and higher interest rates 
interest expense we did not incur any interest expense during in july  we borrowed million against our credit facility with comerica bank  resulting in  in interest expense 
we repaid the borrowing in the fourth quarter of and ended the year with no debt outstanding 
income before income taxes income before income tax for decreased to approximately million from million in the decrease is due to the recording of million related to the settlement of litigation and the reserve for remaining lawsuits  which offsets the increase in sales of million and gross profit of million 
we expect that income in future periods will be significantly impacted by the success of our current products  new product introductions  and year over year changes in our advertising  research and development  and legal expenses 

table of contents provision for income tax expense in  we recorded a provision for income tax expense at our combined federal and state estimated  effective tax rates

the company also recorded an increase in charitable contributions of million 
research and development research and development expense decreased from approximately million in to million in we had previously announced our intention to spend of net sales annually on research and development efforts  however  due to research and development efforts being diverted as a result of product liability litigation matters  we did not spend at that level in we continue to maintain research and development efforts and remain focused on developing new products 
interest other income other income increased to almost million in  approximately million higher than the increase is attributable to royalty income associated with a gum product marketed by wrigley 
we do not anticipate any future royalty income under this agreement

liquidity and capital resources our working capital increased to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of approximately million

during the company acquired million of equipment and intellectual property  related to the dry handle swab product  from viridian 
additionally  the company is having new equipment built in order to produce swabs utilizing the acquired intellectual property 
we expect to spend approximately million during to complete a new automated line to produce our swab product 
we expect the new line will be owned by the company  but will be managed and run by a contract manufacturer 
the company also capitalized the development and redesign of the zicam and nasal comfort websites 
during  we also acquired approximately  of tooling related to our new zicam flu relief products 

table of contents the company s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from sales of our products to retailers and distributors 
the majority of sales are given day credit terms  however  payment terms are occasionally extended  as retailers begin to increase inventory of our products prior to the onset of the cough and cold season 
the company records an estimated allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts  which is reviewed on a monthly basis 
we believe our allowance as of december  is adequate 
the change in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses largely reflects the increase in the company s business and reflects the seasonal nature of the company s business 
the company records the bulk of its sales  which is reflected in higher accounts receivable  in the third  fourth and first quarters  builds inventory during the second through fourth quarter periods  and advertises its products  which is the largest component of accrued expenses  in the fourth and first quarters 
although affected by the build up of inventory in the second through fourth quarters  accounts payable and accrued expenses are more significantly affected by advertising spending  which largely occurs in the fourth and first quarters 
generally  to the extent our operations are profitable  our business is cash flow positive 
we do have working capital requirements arising from the increase of inventory and accounts receivable in excess of the increase in accounts payable  but these vary throughout the year reflecting the seasonal nature of our business 
due to our tax loss carryforward  we have not incurred sizeable income tax payments 
however  we fully utilized our tax loss carryforward in and we expect to incur higher tax payments in future years 
we do not expect future tax payments to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
historically  the company has had very low capital expenditures since we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our products 
typical capital expenditures include investments in technology  office furniture  and leasehold improvements 
however  during the company anticipates spending approximately million for an automated manufacturing line that will produce our swab products 
in addition  the company occasionally provides deposits and prepayments to our manufacturers to improve and increase manufacturing capabilities for our products 
on january   matrixx entered into an agreement to settle claims made by most of the plaintiffs in the arizona consolidated litigation against the company 
matrixx paid million to fund awards to be made under the settlement agreement and the company paid  to cover the administration of the program by plaintiffs counsel 
we expect approximately of the total million settlement program cost will be covered by insurance  although discussions are continuing with the company s insurance carriers about the exact amount of insurance contributions to the settlement cost 
in april  we established a fully funded deductible insurance program through a product liability insurance carrier 
under the program  we have agreed to reimburse our insurer for its claims administration expenses and for amounts paid out by it in settlement of product liability claims filed after the initial date of the program and which are not covered by insurance programs from prior years 
the terms of the program require us to maintain an irrevocable  evergreen letter of credit issued by a bank or other financial institution to secure our reimbursement obligations to our insurer 
we have a million letter of credit with comerica bank and have reserved an equal amount of cash to secure repayments of amounts that become due under the letter of credit 
the million reserve is noted as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet and has been placed in an interest bearing certificate of deposit 
during  we anticipate entering into a new insurance program that will allow the company to dissolve the fully funded deductible insurance program 
if this occurs  we expect the million currently secured under the existing program will become unrestricted 
we have a million credit facility with comerica bank that was renewed until july  the interest rate under the new credit facility is above prime or at december   which represents a reduction from the previous rate of above prime 
due to the recent settlement of the arizona litigation  the company did not meet two of the financial conditions required in the agreement 
the company has received a waiver for those conditions and there were no borrowings under the facility during we believe that our existing capital resources and our credit line will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations we have entered into certain long term contractual obligations that will require various payments over future periods as follows contractual cash obligations in thousands of dollars payments due by period as of december  less than after total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to our variable rate revolving line of credit with comerica bank 
at no time during fiscal did we have any outstanding balance against this line of credit 
in july  we borrowed million against our credit facility with comerica bank 
the primary purpose for the borrowing was to provide additional liquidity as we built inventory for expected increases in sales during the second half of we generally extend payment terms for customers during the third quarter as customers purchase new products and build inventory for the upcoming cough and cold season 
we repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of and ended fiscal with no debt 
consequently  we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future 
as of december  and december   we did not participate in any market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases of which there were none in fiscal or commodity price risk
