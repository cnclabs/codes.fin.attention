mandalay acquisition on april   we closed our merger with mandalay resort group mandalay under which we acquired mandalay for in cash for each share of common stock of mandalay 
the total acquisition cost of billion included equity value of approximately billion  the assumption or repayment of outstanding mandalay debt with a fair value of approximately billion and billion of transaction costs  offset by the billion received by mandalay from the sale of its interest in motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
the mandalay acquisition expands our portfolio of resorts on the las vegas strip  provides additional sites for future development and expands our employee and customer bases significantly 
these factors result in the recognition of certain intangible assets and significant goodwill 
the purchase price allocation is preliminary and may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition 
in particular  we are still evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets related to individual and group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members 
we did not incur any significant employee termination costs or other exit costs in connection with the mandalay acquisition 
key performance indicators we operate primarily in one segment  the operation of casino resorts  which includes offering gaming  hotel  dining  entertainment  retail and other resort amenities 
giving effect to the mandalay merger  over half of our net revenue is now derived from non gaming activities  a higher percentage than many of our competitors  as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests  including non gaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality 
we believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world  and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive advantage 
as a resort based company  our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts  which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 
we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the high end gaming segment  which can cause variability in our results 
key performance indicators related to revenue are gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slots handle volume indicators  win or hold percentage  which is not fully controllable by us 
our normal table games win percentage is in the range of to of table games drop and our normal slots win percentage is in the range of to of slots handle  hotel revenue indicators hotel occupancy volume indicator  average daily rate adr  price indicator  revenue per available room revpar  a summary measure of hotel results  combining adr and occupancy rate 

table of contents most of our revenue is essentially cash based  through customers wagering with cash or paying for non gaming services with cash or credit cards 
our resorts  like many in the industry  generate significant operating cash flow 
our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 
we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in las vegas  nevada  which exposes us to certain risks outside of our control  such as competition from other recently opened las vegas resorts  including several expanded resorts and a major new competitor  and the impact from expansion of gaming in california 
we are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy  including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 
our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature  though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period  including the timing of major las vegas conventions  the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high end customers  and the level of play during major holidays  including new year and chinese new year 
our results do not depend on key individual customers  though our success in marketing to customer groups  such as convention customers  or the financial health of customer groups  such as business travelers or high end gaming customers from a particular country or region  can impact our results 
overall outlook we have invested heavily in our existing operations in the past three years  and expect to continue to do so on a targeted basis in our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages 
we believe these investments in additional non gaming amenities have enhanced our ability to generate increased visitor volume and allowed us to charge premium prices for our amenities 
the most likely significant factors affecting operating results at our existing resorts in will be the addition of mandalay  the expected continued positive impact of our targeted capital improvements  and the completion of towers and of the signature at mgm grand 
the mandalay acquisition will continue to affect year over year comparisons through april as a result of the net revenues and operating income of these resorts  which includes the impact on depreciation and amortization expense of recognizing depreciable real property and amortizable intangible assets at fair value  and additional interest expense as a result of financing the merger through borrowings under our senior credit facility 
additionally  ongoing impacts of cost savings and revenue enhancements will positively affect earnings throughout some of the capital improvements we made in were made towards the end of the year  so will be the first full year of results including these improvements  particularly at the mirage  where the jet nightclub and several restaurants were added at or near year end 
in addition  this resort will benefit from the beatles themed show by cirque du soleil expected to open in mid these improvements  along with improvements at other resorts  are expected to drive continued increases in revpar and increased customer volumes in gaming areas  restaurants  shops  entertainment venues and our other resort amenities 
towers and of the signature at mgm grand are expected to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
at that time  we will recognize our share of the venture s net income  which will consist of the sales and costs associated with the sales of the condominium units  along with deferred profit from our contribution of land to the venture  within income from unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statement of income 
upon completion of each tower  we will have the opportunity to rent the condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect to have us do so  providing a potential ongoing revenue stream 
financial statement impact of hurricane katrina beau rivage sustained significant damage in late august as a result of hurricane katrina and has been closed since 
we expect to reopen beau rivage in the third quarter of  although some of the resort s rooms  restaurants and other amenities will not reopen until the fourth quarter 
the company maintains insurance covering both property damage and business interruption as a result of the storm 
the deductible under this coverage is approximately million  based on the amount of damage incurred 
based on current estimates  insurance proceeds are expected to exceed the net book value of damaged assets  therefore  the company will not record an impairment charge related to the storm and upon ultimate settlement of the claim will likely record a gain 
the damaged assets have been written off and a corresponding insurance receivable  classified within other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  has been recorded 
business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during the period of closure and up to six months following the reopening of the facility 
the costs expected to be incurred during the interruption period are less than the anticipated business interruption proceeds  therefore  post storm costs are being offset by the expected recoveries 
all post storm costs and expected recoveries are recorded net within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  except for depreciation of non damaged assets  which is classified as depreciation and amortization 

table of contents results of operations summary financial results the following table summarizes our financial results year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except per share data net revenues operating income income from continuing operations diluted income from continuing operations per share references to same store results throughout management s discussion and analysis exclude the mandalay resorts and monte carlo for all periods 
same store results also exclude beau rivage for all periods 
on a consolidated basis  the most important factors and trends contributing to our performance over the last three years have been the addition of mandalay s resorts on april  for the eight months we owned the mandalay resorts  net revenue for these operations was billion and operating income was million  the ongoing capital investments in our resorts  which we believe is allowing us to market more effectively to visitors  capture a greater share of our visitors increased travel budgets  and generate premium pricing for our resorts rooms and other amenities 
these investments include the spa tower at bellagio  which opened in december  and the repositioning of mgm grand las vegas  highlighted by k  by cirque du soleil  and the skylofts and west wing room enhancements  the overall positive economic environment in the united states since early  particularly in the leisure and business travel segments  resulting in increases in room pricing and increased visitation  particularly at our las vegas strip resorts  the closure of beau rivage in august after hurricane katrina 
operating income was million at beau rivage in and decreased to million in as a result of only having eight months of operations  the war with iraq and the outbreak of sars in asia  both of which negatively impacted leisure travel and our high end gaming business in late and early  the new labor contract covering employees at our las vegas strip resorts since mid  which provides for significant annual wage and benefits increases through as a result of the above trends  our net revenues increased in  and on a same store basis 
operating margins were relatively flat with in compared to in the margin was a significant increase over the operating margin in see further discussion of operating income and operating margins in operating results below 
the increase in income from continuing operations generally resulted from the increased operating income  offset in part by increased interest expense  discussed below in non operating results 
operating results the following table includes key information about our operating results year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands net revenues operating expenses casino and hotel operations general and administrative corporate expense preopening  restructuring and property transactions  net depreciation and amortization income from unconsolidated affiliates operating income 
table of contents the increase in net revenues resulted from the addition of mandalay and an increase in same store net revenues 
same store net revenues increased largely as a result of strong room pricing and increased volumes in slots and across all non gaming areas 
these trends were particularly prominent at bellagio and mgm grand las vegas as a result of new and expanded amenities at those resorts 
the increase in net revenues was largely due to strong room pricing  increased gaming volumes  and the impact of targeted capital investments in and at new york new york and mgm grand las vegas 
in  operating income did not increase to the same extent as net revenues  largely due to already strong operating margins  a lower than normal bad debt provision in  higher corporate expense and higher preopening  restructuring and property transactions  net 
this resulted in an operating margin of versus in corporate expense increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to merger integration costs 
our operating income in increased  due primarily to the strong revenue trends and a full year of borgata s results 
the increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates was responsible for approximately one third of the increase in operating income  while improvements at our operating resorts  particularly bellagio  mgm grand las vegas and new york new york  made up the rest of the increase 
operating income at mgm grand detroit was essentially flat in compared to  despite an increase in the gaming tax rate from to effective september we expect operating margins to stay relatively consistent with current levels in anticipated revenue gains at mandalay resorts and continued realization of merger cost savings will offset typical increases in labor costs  the additional gaming tax payable to the city of detroit beginning january   and the inclusion of stock compensation expense see recently issued accounting standards 
operating results detailed revenue information the following table presents detail of our net revenues year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands casino revenue  net table games slots other casino revenue  net non casino revenue rooms food and beverage entertainment  retail and other non casino revenue less promotional allowances table games revenue  including baccarat  was flat on a same store basis in a increase in table games volume was offset by a slightly lower hold percentage  though hold percentages were within our normal range for all three years presented 
in  table games volume increased  with particular strength in baccarat volume  up 
in both and  key events such as new year  chinese new year and other marketing events  were well attended 
slots revenue increased on a same store basis  following a increase in additional volume in was generated by the spa tower at bellagio bellagio s slots revenue increased over and the traffic generated by k and other amenities at mgm grand las vegas  where slots revenue increased almost 
in both periods  we benefited from the continued success of our players club affinity program and marketing events targeted at repeat customers 
hotel revenue increased on a same store basis in we had more rooms available as a result of the bellagio expansion and room remodel activity at mgm grand las vegas  and our company wide same store revpar increased to this was on top of a increase in over the increase in revpar in was entirely rate driven  as same store occupancy was consistent at 
the increase was also largely rate driven 

table of contents other non gaming revenue was also up in  with k leading to a increase in same store entertainment revenue  and several new restaurants and bars at mgm grand las vegas  bellagio  ti and the mirage leading to a increase in same store food and beverage revenue 
these results followed similar trends experienced in compared to we expect these increases to continue in  as we will open a new beatles themed cirque du soleil show at the mirage  along with more new restaurants and lounges across our resort portfolio  including the recently opened jet nightclub and several restaurants at the mirage

preopening and start up expenses related to borgata represent our share of the operating results of borgata prior to its july opening 
we expect preopening and start up expenses for project citycenter and mgm grand macau to increase in in addition  we will incur preopening and start up expenses related to the permanent facility at mgm grand detroit and the new beatles themed show by cirque du soleil at the mirage 
restructuring costs credit consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands contract termination costs siegfried roy show closure the mirage other there were no material restructuring activities in at december   there were no material restructuring accruals 
all material restructuring costs have been fully paid or otherwise resolved 
in  restructuring costs include million for contract termination costs related to the aqua restaurant at bellagio and million of workforce reduction costs at mgm grand detroit as a result of our efforts to minimize the impact of a gaming tax increase in michigan 
in  restructuring costs included million related to the closure of the siegfried roy show  primarily for severance costs of employees involved in the show s production 
also  we terminated a restaurant lease and closed two marketing offices  resulting in million of contract termination charges 
other severance of million in related primarily to restructuring of table games staffing at several resorts

demolition costs in and related primarily to preparation for the bellagio standard room remodel  bellagio expansion and k theatre at mgm grand las vegas 
non operating results the following table summarizes information related to interest on our long term debt year ended december  in thousands interest cost less capitalized interest interest expense  net cash paid for interest  net of amounts capitalized weighted average total debt balance billion billion billion weighted average interest rate interest cost was higher in due to the funding of the cash consideration in the mandalay acquisition through senior credit facility borrowings  and the assumption of debt in the mandalay acquisition 
while variable market interest rates continued to increase in  our effective interest rate decreased due to a more normalized ratio of variable rate debt in  our variable interest rate under our senior credit facility has been lower than the interest rates on our fixed rate borrowings 
capitalized interest increased in as we began capitalizing interest on project citycenter and our investment in mgm grand paradise limited 
we expect capitalized interest to increase in as we will start capitalizing interest on a longer portion of the land related to project city center and as we spend more on the construction of project citycenter 
interest cost was higher in as we had a higher average borrowing rate due to increases in variable interest rates and the issuance of significant fixed rate debt in the second half of in anticipation of the mandalay merger 
capitalized interest increased in due to the ongoing bellagio expansion and k theatre projects offset partially by the cessation of interest capitalization on our investment in borgata in july non operating items from unconsolidated affiliates  primarily our share of interest expense at borgata and silver legacy and state income taxes at borgata  increased from million in to million in borgata s lower interest expense was largely offset by the addition of silver legacy s interest expense  and the remaining decrease resulted from a reduction in state income taxes in the fourth quarter of at borgata as a result of recording the benefit of certain investment tax credits 
in  non operating items from unconsolidated affiliates was higher than  million versus million  due to the full year of borgata s results  offset by the reduction to state income taxes in the fourth quarter of described above 
the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes year ended december  in thousands income from continuing operations before income tax income tax provision effective income tax rate cash paid for income taxes the effective income tax rate in was lower than in due primarily to a tax benefit realized from the repatriation of foreign earnings from australia as a result of the provisions of the american jobs creation act of that provided for a special one time deduction of percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  in the company accrued additional state deferred taxes related to capital investments in new jersey and incurred non deductible costs related to a michigan ballot initiative  neither of these items recurred in 
table of contents the effective income tax rate in was higher than in primarily due to the additional new jersey taxes and non deductible michigan ballot initiative costs discussed above  as well as overseas development costs for which no tax benefit was provided and the reversal of a greater amount of tax reserves in compared to as a result of completion of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations 
in  taxes paid decreased from  in part due to increased tax benefits from stock option exercises and one time benefit plan deductions  partially offset by decreased accelerated tax depreciation deductions and increased pre tax income 
in addition  a federal tax overpayment from was applied to  reducing the tax payments 
in  taxes paid increased from  primarily due to increased pre tax income and the full utilization of tax credit carryforwards in we expect cash paid for income taxes to increase significantly in due to the required payment of taxes on the gain on mandalay s sale of motorcity casino  required tax payments on the income associated with towers and of the signature at mgm grand  and continued increases in income resulting from the mandalay merger and continued improvements in operating results

summary of expected sources and uses of funds in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  other significant operating uses of cash in include tax payments 
other significant investing uses of cash flow in include uncommitted capital expenditures  expected to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest and spending at beau rivage

we generated almost billion in operating cash flow in  which included deductions for interest payments  tax payments and certain contractually committed payments reflected in the above table  including operating leases  employment agreements and entertainment agreements 
we expect to generate a higher level of operating cash flow in due primarily to the continued impact of the mandalay acquisition  as well as expected increases in operating income at other resorts 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements

senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 

table of contents allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio  mgm grand las vegas  mandalay bay and the mirage 
our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent  although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well 
we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely 
these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts  including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices  personal contacts  the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 
markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states 
markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries  but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 
we maintain an allowance  or reserve  for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts 
the provision for doubtful accounts  an operating expense  increases the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts 
at resorts where marker play is not significant  the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances 
at resorts where marker play is significant  we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount  based on the age of the account  the customer s financial condition  collection history and any other known information 
we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 
the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors  including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries 
because individual customer account balances can be significant  the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods  as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region s economy occur 
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables at december  in thousands casino accounts receivable allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable median age of casino accounts receivable days days days percentage of casino accounts outstanding over days the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the last two years  particularly in  as a result of improved collections leading to improved credit statistics 
our reserve percentages for and are consistent with the percentage before the september  attacks  and are representative of a more normalized collection experience and positive global economic conditions relative to the conditions in and at december   a basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by million  or less than per share 
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost 
for the majority of our property and equipment  cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with the mandalay acquisition and the may mirage resorts acquisition 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
when we construct assets  we capitalize direct costs of the project  including fees paid to architects and contractors  property taxes  and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries 

table of contents we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also may be a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets  engineering studies  and our estimate of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project 
capitalization of interest starts when construction activities  as defined in sfas  begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 
whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management s actions 
in november  we announced the development of project citycenter in las vegas 
in connection with this announcement and the start of design activities  we began capitalizing interest associated with this project  including capitalizing interest on land costs for the portion of the project citycenter site not currently being utilized in operations 
interest capitalized on this project for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  offers received  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model 
if an asset is still under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment losses  whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used  are recorded as operating expenses 
there are several estimates  assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long lived assets 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
on a quarterly basis  we review our major long lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment 
we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets 
when appropriate  we discount future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital  developed using a standard capital asset pricing model 
whenever an impairment loss is recorded  or a test for impairment is made  we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee 
see results of operations for discussion of write downs and impairments recorded in  and in june  we entered into an agreement to sell the golden nugget subsidiaries 
the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value  therefore no impairment was indicated 
in february  we entered into an agreement to sell mgm grand australia 
the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value  therefore no impairment was indicated 
other than the above items  we are not aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material long lived assets for impairment 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 

table of contents as reflected in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and billion of deferred tax liabilities 
except for certain new jersey state net operating losses  certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  related to the new jersey and foreign deferred tax assets were million and million  respectively 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws  we do not take such positions unless we have substantial authority to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations 
we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 
we assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis 
in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas is met  we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits 
we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 
we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved 
when actual results differ from reserve estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved 
for tax years that are examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are settled 
for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
during  we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to to reflect the impact of the irs audits of the through tax years on those subsequent years 
in the fourth quarter of  the statutes of limitations expired for the through tax years  resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes 
in the third quarter of  the statute of limitations expired for our tax return  resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes 
the irs is currently auditing our and tax returns  and the tax returns for years after are subject to possible future examination 
we classify reserves for tax uncertainties within other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes 
reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an item  as well as potential interest associated with those items 
a portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the mirage resorts and mandalay acquisitions 
the irs audit of the tax returns of mirage resorts through the merger date was settled in august  resulting in a payment to the irs of million  including interest 
these matters had been previously reserved for  so the settlement had no impact on our goodwill balances 
any future adjustments to the acquired mirage resorts and mandalay tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
business combinations we account for business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no   accounting for business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting tor goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and related interpretations 
sfas requires that we record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value  and we must make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the mandalay acquisition  we hired third party valuation specialists to assist us with certain fair value estimates  primarily related to land  property and equipment and intangible assets 
we and the third party specialist applied significant judgment and utilized a variety of assumptions in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including market data  estimated future cash flows  growth rates  current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets  market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and settlement plans for contingencies and liabilities 

table of contents the mandalay purchase price allocation is preliminary and may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition 
in particular  the company is still evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets related to individual and group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members 
changes to the assumptions we used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for acquired assets and assumed liabilities and significant changes to these balances could have a material impact to our future reported results 
for instance  lower or higher fair values assigned to property  plant  and equipment and certain amortizable intangible assets could result in lower or higher amounts of depreciation and amortization recorded 
recently issued accounting standards stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the original standard  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  companies had the option of recording stock options issued to employees at fair value or intrinsic value  which generally leads to no expense being recorded 
most companies  including us  opted to use this intrinsic value method and make required disclosures of fair value expense 
sfas r eliminates this intrinsic value alternative 
sfas r was effective for us on january   and all future share based payments must be recorded at fair value 
the following are the key impacts and decisions regarding implementation of sfas r 
valuation model 
under sfas  stock options were generally valued using the black scholes model 
sfas r does not specify which model must be used  but requires that certain assumptions be included in the chosen model  which may be a closed form model  such as the black scholes model  or a binomial model 
we have chosen to continue applying the black scholes model 
vesting patterns 
under sfas r  awards with graded vesting  as all of our awards have  may be expensed in one of two time patterns on a straight line basis over the complete vesting period  as though the entire award was one grant  or on an accelerated basis  treating each vesting layer as a separate grant and amortizing each layer on a straight line basis 
for disclosure purposes under sfas  we used the accelerated basis 
we will use the straight line method for future grants under sfas r 
as discussed below under transition methods  such policy will only apply to future grants 
expense recognized under sfas r for previously granted options will continue to be recorded on the accelerated basis 
estimating forfeitures 
under sfas  we could choose whether to estimate forfeitures at the grant date or recognize actual forfeitures as they occur 
under sfas r  we must estimate forfeitures as of the grant date 
presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows 
under sfas r  the excess of tax benefits realized from the exercise of employee stock options over the tax benefit associated with the financial reporting expense is shown as a financing cash inflow in the statement of cash flows 
previously  these excess benefits were shown as an operating cash inflow 
transition 
there are two allowable transition alternatives the modified prospective transition or the modified retrospective transition 
we will apply the modified prospective transition 
under the modified prospective transition  we will begin applying the valuation and other criteria to stock options granted beginning january  we will begin recognizing expense for the unvested portion of previously issued grants at the same time  based on the valuation and attribution methods originally used to calculate the disclosures 
the impact of adopting sfas r on our operating results will depend in part on the amount of stock options or other share based payments we grant in the future 
the following table shows compensation expense  net of tax  related to options granted through december   based on the options vesting schedules in thousands actual  included in our pro forma disclosures actual  included in our pro forma disclosures actual  included in our pro forma disclosures estimated  to be recorded as expense we do not believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our cash flows or financial position 
rental costs incurred during a construction period in october  the financial accounting standards board issued staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp fas 
fsp fas requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be expensed 
prevalent practice in real estate and hospitality industries had been to capitalize such rental costs during a construction period as a project cost 

table of contents fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of we do not believe that the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on our cash flows or financial position 
we have historically not had significant leases during construction 
we will have some minor leases in connection with project citycenter  and mgm grand paradise limited will have a land lease for the project site in macau 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
as of december   long term fixed rate borrowings represented approximately of our total borrowings 
based on december  debt levels  an assumed basis point change in libor would cause our annual interest cost to change by approximately million
