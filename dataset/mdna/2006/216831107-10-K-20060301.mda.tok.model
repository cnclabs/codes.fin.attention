new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
use of estimates in connection with the sale of the company s automotive operations the sale of the company s automotive operations in included contract provisions which required estimates to be made in accounting and reporting the impact of the sale 
the most significant of these were estimates of final proceeds  estimates of future payments under provisions of the agreement which require the company to indemnify the buyer upon the occurrence of certain liabilities  the amount of pension obligations and plan assets being transferred to the buyer  the amount of post retirement pension obligations assumed by the buyer  and possible severance obligations for key executives of the automotive operations 
the agreement provided for various post closing adjustments based on differences between estimated amounts of cash  debt and target working capital used at closing and final amounts later agreed to by the parties 
the agreement provided for reporting by the buyer of final amounts in early february with subsequent periods for review by the company and resolution of disputes  if any 
amounts used in determining the gain of the sale of the automotive operations at december  included the final amounts reported by the buyer 
differences from those amounts and the final payment amounts agreed to by both parties have been reflected as adjustments to the gain on the sale in the period the final amounts were determined 
the agreement also provided for indemnification of the buyer by the company for all income tax liabilities related to periods prior to closing and for various additional items outlined in the agreement 
indemnity payments would reduce the purchase price and the amount of gain on the sale 
the recorded gain on the sale included reductions for estimates of the expected tax liabilities and the other potential indemnity items to the extent they were deemed to be probable and estimable at december  where amounts are probable and a range of loss is possible  the company considered whether an amount within the range of outcomes was more likely than other amounts 
if so  the most likely amount was recorded as a reduction of the gain with corresponding liabilities for the future indemnity payments 
if no amount within the range of possible amounts was more likely than other amounts  the company recorded the minimum amount believed to be probable 
the company will reevaluate the probability of indemnity payments being required quarterly and adjustments  if any  to the initial estimates will be reflected as income or loss of discontinued operations in the periods when revised estimates are determined 
in connection with the divestiture of the automotive operations  defined benefit plans relating to automotive operations were assumed by the buyer except those relating to previously closed automotive plants 
obligations assumed by the buyer consisted of plans established under collective bargaining agreements  all of which related to discrete automotive employee units  which have been separately measured and were transferred to the buyer at closing and obligations relating to active automotive employees and retirees who participated in the company s non bargained defined benefit plan which covered all eligible non bargained employees 
in the company s actuary had provided estimates of the total obligations  computed using the company s accounting methods and actuarial assumptions  and assets to be transferred to the buyer 
the estimated amounts to be transferred to the buyer and amounts for plans to be retained by the company were measured at december  and were reflected in the disclosures contained in footnotes to the financial statements 
actual amounts transferred were determined in the third quarter of and did not differ materially from the estimates prepared 
similarly  post retirement benefit obligations relating to the automotive operations sold were transferred to the buyer 
actuarial estimates of the amount of obligation being assumed by the buyer and the remaining obligations of the company are disclosed in the accompanying footnotes to financial statements 
final actuarial determinations were completed in and did not differ materially from the estimated amounts shown in the footnotes to the financial statements at december  under terms of an employment agreement with the president of the automotive operations and terms of a change in control severance pay plan for eight additional key automotive executives  such executives are entitled to specified severance payments if terminated by the buyer within predetermined time periods after the sale 
the company is obligated to pay the severance costs and related excise taxes  if any  if severance occurs on or prior to december  in the case of the automotive operation s president and on or prior to december  for the eight other automotive executives 
the company was required to fund  immediately following the sale  its potential 
table of contents obligation for such severance payments into a rabbi trust with a third party trustee for the possible benefit of these executives 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded a liability for the separation of one of these executives 
based on the positions the remaining executives retained after the sale  the ownership interests they acquired as a result of the transaction  and the incentives provided to them by the buyer after the sale  the company does not believe it is presently probable that any of these executives will be terminated within the periods in which it is obligated to pay the severance costs 
accordingly  no additional accrual for severance has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates severance of one or more of the remaining covered executives is probable within the time period covered by the company  accruals for severance will be required 
certain operating leases related to property and equipment used in the operations of cooper standard automotive were guaranteed by the company 
these guarantees require the company  in the event cooper standard fails to honor its commitments  to satisfy the terms of the lease agreements 
as part of the sale of the automotive operations  the company is seeking releases of those guarantees but to date has been unable to secure releases from certain lessors 
the most significant of those leases is for a u 
s 
manufacturing facility with a remaining term of years and total remaining payments of approximately million 
other leases cover two facilities in the united kingdom and manufacturing equipment 
these leases have remaining terms of from one to eight years and remaining payments of approximately million 
the company does not believe it is presently probable that it will be called upon to make these payments 
accordingly  no accrual for these guarantees has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates its performance under these guarantees is probable  accruals for the obligations will be required 
products liability the company is a defendant in various products liability claims in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company 
litigation of this type has increased significantly throughout the tire industry following the firestone tire recall announced in the company accrues costs for products liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be estimated 
the company believes the probability of loss can be established and the amount of loss can be estimated only after certain minimum information is available  including verification that company produced products were involved in the incident giving rise to the claim  the condition of the product purported to be involved in the claim  the nature of the incident giving rise to the claim  and the extent of the purported injury or damages 
in cases where such information is known  each products liability claim is evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances 
a judgment is then made  taking into account the views of counsel and other relevant factors  to determine the requirement for establishment or revision of an accrual for any potential liability 
in most cases  the liability cannot be determined with precision until the claim is resolved 
pursuant to applicable accounting rules  the company accrues the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another 
no specific accrual is made for individual unasserted claims or for asserted claims where the minimum information needed to evaluate the probability of a liability is not yet known 
however  an accrual for such claims based  in part  on management s expectations for future litigation activity is maintained 
because of the speculative nature of litigation in the united states  the company does not believe a meaningful aggregate range of potential loss for asserted and unasserted claims can be determined 
the total cost of resolution of such claims  or increase in reserves resulting from greater knowledge of specific facts and circumstances related to such claims  could have a greater impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company in future periods and  in some periods  could be material 
the company s exposure for each claim occurring prior to april  is limited by the coverage provided by its excess liability insurance program 
the program for that period includes a relatively low per claim retention and a policy year aggregate retention limit on claims arising from occurrences which took place during a particular policy year 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits  and the establishment of a captive insurance company 
premium costs for insurance coverage in excess of the self insured amounts for the april  to march  policy year were  higher than under the program in place prior to april   the per claim retention limit increased  and the aggregate retention limit was eliminated  while excess liability coverage increased by  the company continued the program effective april  with an increase in the per claim retention limit of  and a premium cost reduction of  the total per claim retention limit for claims occurring in this policy year is  the products liability expense reported by the company includes amortization of insurance premium costs  adjustments to settlement reserves  and legal costs incurred in defending claims against the company offset by recoveries of legal fees 
legal costs are expensed as incurred and products liability insurance premiums are amortized over coverage periods 
the company is entitled to reimbursement  under certain insurance contracts in place for periods ending prior to april   of legal fees expensed in prior periods based on events occurring in the those periods 
the company records the reimbursements under such policies in the period the conditions for reimbursement are met 
products liability costs totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and include recoveries of legal fees of   and  in  and  respectively 
policies applicable to claims occurring on april  and thereafter do not provide for recovery of legal fees 

table of contents income taxes the company is required to make certain estimates and judgments to determine income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are made in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to tax provisions in subsequent periods 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for income tax expense must be increased by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are deemed to be not recoverable 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net capital loss  state net operating losses and state tax credits at december  as it does not anticipate the utilization of these assets before they expire 
in the event there is a change in circumstances in the future which would affect the utilization of these deferred tax assets  the tax provision in that accounting period would be reduced by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves a degree of uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other jurisdictions based on its estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if  and at the time  the company determines payment of such amounts are not probable  the liability will be reversed and a tax benefit recognized to reduce the provision for income taxes 
the company will record an increase to its provision for income tax expense in the period it determines it is probable that recorded liabilities are less than the ultimate tax assessment 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment or definite lived intangible assets  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying values 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values of the assets  then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
during  impairments of 
million were recorded related to molds used in the north american tire operations segment 
during  impairments of million were recorded as part of the company s restructuring expenses related to the decision to cease radial medium truck tire production 
the company assesses the potential impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite lived assets at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the carrying value of these assets is compared to their fair value 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is computed and the impairment charge  if any  is then recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company assessed its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and no impairment was indicated 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension liabilities in the united states and the united kingdom and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the united states that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets  and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the rate used to estimate the value of the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities for which they could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company considers the most recent available interest rates on moody s aa corporate bonds  with maturities of at least twenty years  late in the fourth quarter and then factors into the rate its expectations for change by year end 
the company discounted the expected pension disbursements over the next fifty years using a yield curve based on market data as of december  which validated the present value determined using the single benchmark rate for all years 
based upon this analysis  the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its united states pension and postretirement benefit liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  a similar analysis was completed in the united kingdom and the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its united kingdom pension liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the effect of these reductions in the discount rate assumption was to increase the projected benefit obligation at december  which will also result in increases of approximately million in pension expense and approximately  in other postretirement benefits expense during the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  because the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increases in measuring its united states 
table of contents pension liabilities at december  and december  in the united kingdom  the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increase at december  compared to a rate of percent at december  the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
the company s investment policy for united states plans assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
the company s investment policy for united kingdom plan assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
this computed rate of return is reviewed by the company s investment advisors and actuaries 
industry comparables and other outside guidance is also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
the actual return on united states pension plans assets approximated percent in and percent in the lower actual return on plan assets reflects more modest equity and fixed income returns than the prior year 
the actual return on united kingdom pension plan assets approximated percent in and percent in the higher returns in were mainly the result of very strong equity returns  with the united kingdom plan s u 
k 
equities returning more than percent and its overseas equities returning more than percent 
using recent and projected market and economic conditions  the company maintained its estimate for the expected long term return on its united states plan assets at nine percent  the same assumption used to derive and expense 
the expected long term return on united kingdom plan assets used to derive the pension expense was percent compared to a rate of percent used to derive the pension expense 
the lower rate is the result of a reduction in bond yields in which led to an expectation of lower investment returns in the company has accumulated net deferred losses resulting from the shortfalls and excesses in actual returns on pension plan assets from expected returns and  in the measurement of pensions liabilities  decreases and increases in the discount rate and the rate of future compensation increases and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience totaling million at december  these amounts are being amortized in accordance with the corridor amortization requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  over periods ranging from ten years to years 
amortization of these net deferred losses was million in and million in the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  in and  to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation on the company s retiree medical obligation  instituted per participant  or per household  caps on the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to future retirees 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the company implemented increased cost sharing in in the retiree medical coverage provided to certain eligible current and future retirees 
since then cost sharing has expanded such that nearly all covered retirees pay a charge to be enrolled 
the medical care cost trend rate has a significant impact on the liabilities recorded by the company 
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase retiree medical obligations by million and increase retiree medical benefits expense by 
million 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was enacted in december the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as an option for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of this fsp provided accounting and disclosure guidance for employers who sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide drug benefits 
regulations regarding implementation of provisions relevant to the company s accounting are complex and contain acknowledged open issues 
the act reduced the company s net periodic postretirement benefit cost by  in including service cost  interest cost and amortization of the actuarial gain 
the total impact on the company s actuarial liability in  under all u 
s 
plans  was a reduction of  and is being accounted for as an actuarial gain that will be amortized as a reduction of the company s periodic expense and balance sheet liability over a period of fifteen years 
the net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes the benefits of the act 
the company has applied to receive the federal drug subsidy in and intends to continue to analyze the options available with respect to the relationship of the company health care benefits with all parts of medicare to attain the most cost effective coordination 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements certain operating leases related to property and equipment used in the operations of cooper standard automotive were guaranteed by the company 
these guarantees require the company  in the event cooper standard fails to honor its commitments  to satisfy the terms of the lease agreements 
as part of the sale of the automotive operations  the company is seeking releases of those guarantees but to date has been unable to secure releases from certain lessors 
the most significant of those leases is for a u 
s 
manufacturing facility with a remaining term of years and total remaining payments of approximately million 
other leases cover two facilities in the united kingdom and manufacturing equipment 
these leases have remaining terms of from one to eight years and remaining payments of approximately million 
the company does not believe it is presently probable that it will be called upon to make these payments 
accordingly  no accrual for these guarantees has been recorded 
if information becomes known to the company at a later date which indicates its performance under these guarantees is probable  accruals for the obligations will be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates from its financial instruments 
the company actively monitors its exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the impact of these risks 
see the significant accounting policies derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
these analyses measure the potential loss in future earnings  cash flows or fair values of market sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
a ten percent decrease in interest rates would have adversely affected the fair value of the company s fixed rate  long term debt by approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  a ten percent increase in the interest rates for the company s floating rate long term debt obligations would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows 
to manage the volatility of currency exchange exposures related to future sales and purchases  the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
for the residual portion  the company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options with maturities of less than months pursuant to the company s policies and hedging practices 
the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the fair value of cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company s unprotected exposures to earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not significant at december  and the company enters into fair value  foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
the impact from a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s foreign currency denominated obligations and related foreign exchange contracts would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows
