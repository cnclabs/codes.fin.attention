item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this report

the following discussion of the results of the operations and financial condition of mocon should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview mocon  inc designs  manufactures  markets and services products and provides consulting services primarily in the measurement and analytical instrument and services markets 
our products include instruments that detect  measure and monitor gases and chemical compounds  as well as products that prepare samples of various substances for laboratory analysis 
although some of the markets for our products are maturing  we continually seek growth opportunities through technological and product improvement  by acquiring and developing new products  and by acquiring new companies 
we have three primary operating locations in the united states minnesota  colorado and texas and one in germany 
we use a direct sales force and independent sales representatives to market our products and services in the united states  canada and germany and use a network of independent sales representatives to market and service our products and services in other foreign countries 
prior to  we expanded our business primarily through internally developing new products and technologies and licensing products and technology 
since  we have supplemented our internal growth through acquisitions that have provided us with additional technologies  products and product development expertise 
during the last months  we divested two product lines to allow us to better concentrate on our core product lines  particularly our gas detection and measurement products 
we completed our most recent acquisition effective january   by acquiring paul lippke handels gmbh prozess und laborsysteme lippke  which is located in germany 
we acquired all of the shares of lippke for a base purchase price plus three earnout payments based on the net profits of lippke in each of the years  and  with a minimum payment amount of  euros per year 
it is anticipated that the remaining earnout payments will be made at or near the end of the first quarter of each of the years and the earnout payment due for based on lippke s net profits is  in march  we committed to a plan to discontinue production of our vaculok vacuum insulated panels and exit this product line as the result of the poor financial performance since it was acquired in november we recorded a one time pre tax charge to earnings in our first quarter  totaling approximately  to reflect the results of operations and asset impairment write down associated with the discontinuation of our vaculok business 
the  charge included a non cash asset impairment charge of  relating to equipment and inventory used in the vaculok business 
we sold the assets associated with the vacuum insulated panel product line in july in exchange for an up front payment of  along with the right to receive up to an additional  upon the occurrence of certain post closing events 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately  in the third quarter sales associated with our vacuum insulated panel product line were not significant 
the results of this line of business are shown in the discontinued operations section of our consolidated statements of income  and further explained in the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in february  we sold the capital stock of lab connections  inc in exchange for  in cash  subject to a purchase price adjustment based on the amount of lab connections net tangible assets as of the closing date 
as a result of the sale  we recognized an after tax gain of approximately  in the first quarter overall summary of financial results sales for were  a decrease of compared to  for this decrease in sales was primarily the result of the decreased domestic and foreign sales volume of our permeation products  foreign sales volume of our weighing and pharmaceutical products  domestic sales volume of our consulting and analytical services and foreign sales volume of our sample preparation products  offset somewhat by increases in the domestic and foreign sales volume of our headspace analyzer and gas analyzer products 
our international sales have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
our foreign sales were  or of total sales in  a decrease of compared to  or of sales in  and  or of total sales in net income in was  a increase compared to  in  and net income per diluted share was in  also a increase compared to for our financial position as of december  reflects an increase in working capital of  to  compared to  at december  significant transactions and financial trends throughout these financial sections  you will read about significant transactions or events that materially contribute to  or reduce our earnings  and materially affect our financial results and financial position 
significant transactions and events that affected our financial results and position included the  charge to earnings we recorded in the first quarter to reflect the results of operations and asset impairment write down associated with the discontinuation of our vaculok business and the  charge we recorded in fourth quarter for the impairment of intangible technology rights associated with our lab connections  inc subsidiary 
significant transactions  such as our sale of our vacuum insulated panel line  result from unique facts and circumstances and  given their nature  some of these items will likely not recur with similar materiality or impact on our continuing operations 
our international sales have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues  and despite the two percentage point decrease of our foreign sales to our total sales in compared to  we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future  especially as a result of our acquisition of lippke  which thus far has had  and is expected to continue to have  a positive impact on our sales and earnings  particularly on our foreign permeation products business 
our research and development costs were approximately of our consolidated sales for and approximately and of our consolidated sales for and  respectively 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to spend  on an annual basis  approximately to of our sales on research and development 
while these items are important in understanding and evaluating our financial results  certain trends  such as the increase in the proportion of our international sales over the past three years and the increase in our research and development spending  and other transactions or events such as those discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis may also have a material impact on our financial results 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns is for accounts receivable balances that are estimated to be uncollectible as well as sales returns 
the reserve is based on a number of factors  including an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs and sales returns 
the analysis includes the age of the receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
we believe our financial results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsened for our customers 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period that we made such a determination 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventories we perform an analysis to identify excess and obsolete inventory 
we record a charge to cost of sales for amounts identified 
our analysis includes inventory levels  the nature of the finished product and its inherent risk of obsolescence and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history of that finished product 
we believe that our financial results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions or otherwise 
recoverability of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that expected future undiscounted cash flows might not be sufficient to support the carrying amount of an asset 
we deem an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows is less than an asset s carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a  charge for the impairment of intangible technology rights associated with our lab connections  inc subsidiary 
changes in our business strategies  changes in the economic environment in which we operate  competitive conditions  and other factors could result in future impairment charges 
accrued product warranties our products are generally covered by a warranty  with warranty periods ranging from ninety days to one year from the date of sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized  based on anticipated parts and labor costs  utilizing historical experience 
special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
although we believe the likelihood to be relatively low  warranty claims experience could be materially different from actual results due to manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  as yet unrecognized defects in products sold  or other factors 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  accrued for future estimated warranty claims 
income taxes in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
we carried no valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at either december  or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of our results of operations  stated as a percent of sales  for fiscal years ended december   and our historical financial data were derived from our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
percent of sales sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income other income income before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income the following table summarizes total sales by product line for  and respectively years ended december  permeation products and services gas  headspace and other analyzer products and services other instruments and services total sales the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of domestic and foreign sales  for  and years ended december  domestic sales foreign sales europe asia other total foreign sales total sales sales sales were  in  compared to  in and  in the  or decrease in sales in versus was primarily the result of the decreased domestic and foreign sales volume of our permeation products  foreign sales volume of our weighing and pharmaceutical products  domestic sales volume of our consulting and analytical services and foreign sales volume of our sample preparation products  offset somewhat by increases in the domestic and foreign sales volume of our headspace analyzer and gas analyzer products 
these sales volume decreases were generally the result of decreased demand 
the impact of price increases was not significant in the increase in sales from to was primarily the result of the lippke acquisition  which provided  in net incremental sales 
on a product basis  the increase was primarily due to increased foreign sales volume of our permeation products  foreign sales volume of our leak detection products  domestic sales volume of our gas analyzer products  foreign sales volume of our headspace analyzer products  and foreign sales volume of our weighing products  offset somewhat by decreases in the domestic sales volume of our permeation products and domestic sales volume of our weighing products 
these sales volume increases were generally the result of increased demand 
the impact of price increases in was not significant 
domestic sales were  or of total sales in  an increase of compared to  or in  and  or in foreign sales were  or of total sales in  a decrease of compared to  or of sales in  and  or of total sales in permeation products and services sales of our permeation products were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
the  or decrease in permeation sales in compared to  was primarily due to decreases in foreign sales and  to a lesser extent  to a decrease in domestic sales 
the increase in sales of  from to included  in net incremental sales from lippke into the european market 
we believe that the domestic market for our permeation products  which is where we initially introduced our permeation products when our company was founded  is maturing  but that the market for our permeation products outside of the united states  where the demand for sophisticated packaging and other products is continuing to develop  and the use of our equipment is still in many areas somewhat limited  is likely to continue to grow 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the international market for our permeation products will grow 
gas  headspace and other analyzer products and services sales of our gas analysis and monitoring instrumentation products through our baseline mocon  inc subsidiary were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
the  or increase in sales in as compared to was primarily due to continued customer acceptance of baseline s products in both the domestic and foreign markets 
the  or increase in sales in as compared to was primarily due to increased sales in of the pid techtm photoionization detector on an oem basis to other manufacturers 
in order to reduce operating costs and increase operating efficiencies  we moved the majority of baseline s production to our facility in minneapolis  minnesota in sales of our headspace analyzer and leak detection products were approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in  and  respectively 
the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to continued increases in sales of hand held headspace analyzer products  primarily into our domestic market 
the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to increases in foreign sales  the majority of which were attributable to net incremental sales from lippke 
sales of our weighing and pharmaceutical products were approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
weighing and pharmaceutical product sales decreased in versus  primarily due to decreases in foreign sales  offset somewhat by increases in sales to domestic customers 
weighing and pharmaceutical product sales increased in versus  primarily due to increases in foreign sales  offset somewhat by decreases in sales to domestic customers 
the increase in foreign sales includes net incremental sales from lippke to customers in europe  consisting primarily of commissions earned relating to tablet inspection systems 
because of significant competition in the market for weighing products  we do not expect the sales of our weighing and pharmaceutical products to increase in other instruments and services sales of our sample preparation products through lci amounted to approximately of our consolidated sales in each of the years  and sales of sample preparation products decreased in as compared to  due primarily to a decrease in foreign sales  offset by a slight increase in domestic sales 
sales of sample preparation products increased in as compared to  due primarily to an increase in foreign sales  particularly of a unit designed for high temperature polymer analysis 
sales of our gas chromatography analyzer products through our microanalytics instrumentation corp 
microanalytics subsidiary were approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in  and  respectively 
sales in decreased as compared to due primarily to decreased revenues associated with sales of microanalytics testing services in our domestic market 
a increase in sales in as compared to was due primarily to increased revenues associated with sales of microanalytics testing services 
the majority of microanalytics sales are to domestic customers 
consulting and analytical services cas sales were approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
the majority of cas sales are to domestic customers 
gross profit our gross profits were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in  and  respectively 
the gross profit margin as a percentage of total sales was somewhat higher than due primarily to certain non recurring costs incurred in these costs were associated with the transfer of the majority of our baseline subsidiary s production to our facility in minneapolis  minnesota  to expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the purchase of lippke and to the scrapping of inventory that had become obsolete 
however  in  our product mix included less permeation product sales  which on average carry a higher gross margin and thus somewhat reduced the overall gross margin for the gross profit margin as a percentage of total sales was somewhat lower than due primarily to the non recurring costs noted above  offset somewhat by the product mix in including more permeation product sales  which on average carry a higher gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in were  or of sales  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of sales in the  decrease in sg a expenses from to was primarily due to decreased number of sales personnel and also the expense associated with the lci intangible technology rights one time impairment charge in the increase in the dollar amount of sg a expenses from to was primarily due to the addition of lippke s sg a expenses in  to the expense associated with the lci intangible technology rights one time impairment charge in  and to a lesser extent to recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations more fully described under itema 
risk factors  which increased certain general and administrative costs in research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were  or approximately of sales in  compared to  or approximately of sales in  and  or approximately of sales in the increase of  in compared to is the result of our focus on business development opportunities in our core product areas 
we believe continued r d expenditures are necessary as we develop new products to expand in our niche markets 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to allocate on an annual basis approximately to of sales to research and development 
other income other income consists primarily of earnings on investments and currency exchange rate gains and losses 
other income increased to  in from  in and  in the increase in compared to was primarily due to gains on the exchange of foreign currency  higher average investment balances and higher average investment yields and  to a lesser extent  gains on the sales of fixed assets 
the slight decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower average investment yields 
income tax expense our provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in  in  and in the provision for was favorably impacted as the result of a  reduction in accrued income taxes related to the completion of an internal revenue service examination 
the current year provision would have been without this adjustment 
based on current operating conditions and income tax laws  we expect our core tax rate for to be in the range of to the american jobs creation act of the act was passed in october and included numerous law changes  some of which affect our tax computations 
the provisions of the act include a new deduction for us manufacturers  the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a provision regarding the repatriation of foreign earnings 
net income net income was  in compared to  in  and  in diluted net income per share was in compared to in and in liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and capital equipment requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased  during to  as of december   compared to  at december  our working capital as of december  increased  to  compared to  at december  we believe that a combination of our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  plus an expected continuation of cash flow from operations  will continue to be adequate to fund operations  capital expenditures  dividend payments  stock repurchases  and required earnout payments to the former parent company of lippke  for at least the next twelve months 
however  one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
we may need to fund such activities  should they arise  with a portion of our cash balances and debt and or equity financing 
cash flow cash flows from operating activities our primary source of funds is cash provided by continuing operations 
cash flow from continuing operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
in  cash provided by operating activities decreased by  or  compared to this decrease was due primarily to the increases in inventories and net deferred income taxes and the reduction in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  offset somewhat by higher net income 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher net income  the reduction in inventories and increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  offset somewhat by the increases in deferred income taxes and trade accounts receivable 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled  in as compared to  in and  in net purchases of proceeds from marketable securities were   and  in  and  respectively 
purchases of property  plant and equipment totaled  in  primarily for additions of office  manufacturing and laboratory equipment  as compared to  and  in and  respectively 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  we do not believe that any major property  plant and equipment expenditures are required to accommodate our current level of operations  and we expect purchases in to be similar to the levels in cash paid in acquisitions net of cash acquired in of  related to the purchase of the vaculok product line 
the amounts in and of  and  respectively  were related to the purchase of lippke 
the amount resulted from an adjustment of the second earnout payment between the minimum amount originally recorded and the amount paid  based on actual earnings 
cash flows from financing activities the primary use of cash in  and was for the payment of dividends to our shareholders  in the amounts of   and  respectively 
in addition  during  we made final dividend payments of  to lippke s former parent company 
our board of directors has authorized  depending upon market conditions and other factors  the repurchase of up to a total of  of our common stock 
as of december   the entire  was remaining in the current authorization 
during and  we made repurchases of our common stock totaling  and  respectively  related to a previous authorization 
cash flow from the exercise of stock options was generated in the amounts of   and  for the years  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases total contractual cash obligations in connection with the lippke acquisition  we were obligated to make three future earnout payments to lippke s former parent company based on the net profits of lippke in each of the years  and we made the first payment of  in the first quarter  and expect to make the second payment of  in the first quarter the final payment is expected to be paid in the first quarter off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the rules and regulations of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides accounting guidance for companies that will be eligible for a tax deduction resulting from qualified production activities income as defined in the american jobs creation act of the act 
fsp requires this deduction be treated as a special deduction in accordance with sfas  which does not require a revaluation of our us deferred tax assets 
we have applied the guidance in fsp with regard to recognition of this tax deduction during the application of fsp did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas in the fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payments sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of valuing share based payment transactions and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  we expect to adopt sfas r on january  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to have an impact on our results of operations  though it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we expect to adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be accurately predicted at this time since it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
future compensation cost  net of tax effects  related to unvested stock compensation as of december  is expected to be approximately  in   in   in and  in as valued and calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
actual share based compensation expense in future periods will be dependent upon amounts and value of future awards 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  there were no amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions in  and as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments using opinion s intrinsic value method of valuing share based payment transactions and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk substantially all of our marketable securities are at fixed interest rates 
however  virtually all of the marketable securities mature in two years or less  therefore  we believe that the market risk arising from the holding of these financial instruments is minimal 
foreign currency exchange risk because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on our results from operations outside of the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
we currently sell our products and services in united states dollars or the local currency of our foreign subsidiary euros 
accordingly  our foreign operations expose us to foreign currency exchange risk when the euro currency results of operations are translated to united states dollars 
while we historically have not experienced any material foreign currency translation losses  we may engage in hedging activity in the future to minimize this risk 
our net investment in foreign subsidiary translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  and would not impact our net income
