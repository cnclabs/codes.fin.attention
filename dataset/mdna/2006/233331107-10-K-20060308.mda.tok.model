item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dte energy is a growing and diversified energy company with revenues in excess of billion and approximately billion in assets 
since  our asset base has increased by and operating revenues have grown by we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon  regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern michigan 
we operate three energy related non utility segments with operations throughout the united states 
in  our utilities and power and industrial projects segment generated most of our earnings 
the improvement in earnings was due to rate increases at our michigan utilities  favorable weather and continued asset gains from the synthetic fuel business 
earnings were also impacted by mark to market losses in our fuel transportation and marketing segment and losses from discontinued operations 
our financial performance improved over the following table summarizes our income since in millions  except earnings per share net income earnings per diluted share excluding discontinued operations and accounting changes income from continuing operations earnings per diluted share the items discussed below influenced our financial performance and may affect future results effects of weather and accounts receivable on utility operations  electric rate orders  electric customer choice program  and coal and uranium supply  gas rate and gas cost recovery orders and gas supply  synfuel related earnings and the impact of higher oil prices on production credit phase outs  investments in our unconventional gas production business  mark to market losses in our fuel transportation and marketing business  and cost reduction efforts and required capital investment 
utility operations weather earnings at our utility operations are seasonal and very sensitive to weather 
electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather  while the gas utility s results are dependent on cold winter weather 
the following table explains the impact of weather relative to year historical normal weather temperatures for each utility 

table of contents percentage change from normal estimated effect on net income dollars in millions electric gas electric gas year utility utility utility utility total electric utility is based on cooling degree days and the gas utility is based on heating degree days 
the positive impact of warmer weather was partially mitigated by the rate cap on residential customers which prevented us from passing through increased generation and purchased power costs incurred to serve the higher demand 
additionally  we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages 
restoration and other costs associated with storm related power outages lowered pretax earnings by million in  million in and million in receivables both utilities continue to experience high levels of past due receivables  especially within our gas utility operations 
the increase is attributable to economic conditions  high natural gas prices and the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers 
we have taken aggressive actions to reduce the level of past due receivables including  increased customer disconnections  contracting with collection agencies and working with the state of michigan and others to increase the share of low income funding allocated to our customers 
in  we sold previously written off accounts of million resulting in a gain and net proceeds of million 
the gain was recorded as a recovery through bad debt expense  which is included within operation and maintenance expense 
as a result of these factors  our allowance for doubtful accounts expense for the two utilities decreased to million in from million in the april mpsc gas rate order provided for an uncollectible tracking mechanism for michcon 
we will file an annual application comparing our actual uncollectible expense to our designated revenue recovery of approximately million 
ninety percent of the difference from the date of the order will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 
electric utility electric rate orders in  the mpsc issued interim and final rate orders that authorized electric rate increases totaling million  eliminated transition credits and implemented transition charges for electric customer choice customers 
the increases were applicable to all customers not subject to a rate cap 
the mpsc also authorized the recovery of approximately million in regulatory assets  including stranded costs 
as a result of increased rates  our pretax margins were higher by million 
electric customer choice our customers have the option of participating in the electric customer choice program where they can select an alternative electric supplier 
due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial period of electric customer choice  many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers 
the impact of the final rate order in  that increased base rates including the recovery of lost margins and transition charges  combined with recent higher wholesale electric prices has resulted in many former electric customer choice customers migrating back to detroit edison for electrical generation service  partially mitigating the financial impact of the electric customer choice program 
the return of customers from the electric customer choice program resulted in higher gross margins during the following graph depicts the electric customer choice volumes 
table of contents bar graph we continue to work with the mpsc to address issues associated with the electric customer choice program 
in february  we filed a revenue neutral rate restructuring proposal with the mpsc designed to adjust rates for each customer class to be reflective of the full costs incurred to service such customers 
in december  the mpsc issued an order that took some initial steps to improve the current competitive imbalance in michigan s electric customer choice program 
the december order establishes cost based power supply rates for detroit edison s full service customers 
electric customer choice participants will pay cost based distribution rates  while detroit edison s full service commercial and industrial customers will pay cost based distribution rates that reflect the cost of the residential rate subsidy 
residential customers pay a subsidized below cost rate for distribution service 
these revenue neutral revised rates were effective february  coal supply our generating fleet produces in excess of of its electricity from coal 
increasing coal demand from domestic and international markets has resulted in significant price increases 
in addition  difficulty in recruiting workers  obtaining environmental permits and finding economically recoverable amounts of new coal has resulted in decreasing coal output from the central appalachian region 
furthermore  as a result of environmental regulation and declining eastern coal stocks  demand for cleaner burning western coal has increased 
this increased demand for western coal has also resulted in a corresponding demand for western rail shipping  straining railroad capacity  resulting in longer lead times for western coal shipments 
uranium supply we operate one nuclear facility that undergoes a periodic refueling outage approximately every eighteen months 
uranium prices have been rising due to supply concerns 
in the future  there may be additional nuclear facilities constructed in the industry that may place additional pressure on uranium supplies and prices 
gas utility gas final rate order in april  the mpsc issued a final rate order authorizing michcon to earn a rate of return on common equity of based on a debt and equity capital structure 
highlights of the order include million increase in annual base rates  base rate increase includes million to recover safety and training costs  deferral as a regulatory liability for the non capitalized portion of negative pension expense  and adoption of a tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the final rate order from the mpsc denied recovery or required accounting impairment for the following items million of allocated merger interest from dte energy related to the acquisition of mcn energy  million of internal labor and legal costs to remediate mgp sites  million as a result of a change to the allocation of historical mgp insurance proceeds  
table of contents million of computer equipment and related depreciation  and million impairment related to of the cost of a computer billing system in place prior to dte energy s acquisition of mcn energy 
this impairment had a minimal earnings impact on dte energy because a valuation allowance was established for this asset at the time of the mcn acquisition in additionally  the rate order adjusted michcon s depreciation rates and the related revenue requirements with no resulting impact on net income 
gas cost recovery order based on rate orders in place for and  we filed a gas cost recovery case in and recorded a million regulatory asset related to unbilled volumes as of december  over time we recorded million of interest associated with this regulatory asset 
in its april  order  the mpsc disallowed recovery and we recorded the impact of the disallowance in the first quarter of natural gas supply increased demand from natural gas power plants  hurricane related supply disruptions  regulatory constraints and limited exploration have combined to strain existing natural gas supplies and caused substantial increases in prices 
non utility operations we anticipate significant investment opportunities within our non utility businesses 
we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing opportunities that will leverage our existing assets  skill and expertise 
specifically  we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile 
assuming no phase out of production tax credits  the source of investment capital is the estimated cumulative billion we anticipate from synfuel cash flow which consists of cash from operations  asset sales  and the utilization of current and previously earned production tax credits to reduce tax payments 
tax credit carryforward utilization in part could be extended past  if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts 
however  if oil prices remain at current levels or continue to increase  the estimated cash flow from the synfuel business would be significantly less and would adversely impact the success of this strategy  unless we identify alternative sources of cash 
power and industrial projects we anticipate building around our core strengths in the markets where we operate 
in determining the markets in which to compete  we closely examine the regulatory environment  the number of competitors and our ability to achieve sustainable margins 
we plan to maximize the effectiveness of our inter related businesses as we expand from our current regional focus 
as we pursue growth opportunities  our first priority will be to achieve value added returns 
we plan to focus on the following areas for growth optimizing the remaining life of our synfuel portfolio  providing operating services to owners of industrial and power plants  acquiring and developing solid fuel fired power plants  expanding on site energy projects  and developing new tax advantaged opportunities 
synfuel related earnings we operate nine synthetic fuel production plants throughout the united states 
synfuel plants chemically change coal into a synthetic fuel as determined under the internal revenue code 
production tax credits are provided for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal 
these tax credits expire on december  our synthetic fuel plants generate operating losses which are offset by the resulting production tax credits 
we have not had sufficient taxable income to fully utilize production tax credits earned in prior periods 
as of december   we have million in tax credit carry forwards 

table of contents to optimize income and cash flow from our synfuel operations  we have sold interests in all nine of our facilities  representing of our total production capacity as of december  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional interests in our two remaining majority owned plants 
proceeds from the sales are contingent upon production levels and the value of such credits 
when we sell an interest in a synfuel project  we recognize the gain as the facility produces and sells synfuel and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in substance  we are receiving synfuel gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits associated with the projects sold 
sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base 
the value of a production tax credit can vary each year and is adjusted annually by an inflation factor as published by the irs in april of the following year 
the value of the production tax credit in a given year is reduced if the reference price of oil within the year exceeds a threshold price and is eliminated entirely if the reference price exceeds a phase out price 
the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil 
during  the monthly average wellhead prices were approximately lower than the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for light  sweet crude oil 
the actual or estimated reference price and beginning and ending phase out prices per barrel of oil for through are as follows beginning phase out ending phase out reference price price price actual estimated estimated not available estimated not available recent events have increased domestic crude oil prices  including hurricane related supply disruptions and continued worldwide demand 
through december   the nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil for averaged approximately  which due to the uncertainty of the wellhead nymex difference  is comparable to an approximate reference price 
for the remaining life of the tax credits  if the reference price falls within or exceeds the phase out range  the availability of production tax credits in that year would be reduced or eliminated 
any actual tax credit phase out for and available tax credits  if any  will not be certain until published by the irs in april as of february   the realized and unrealized nymex daily closing price of a barrel of oil was  equating to an estimated reference price of  which is within the phase out range 
if prices remain at this level throughout  we would experience a phase out of the production tax credits and our synthetic fuel business would be adversely affected  this could have an impact on our synthetic fuel production plans which  in turn  may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flow  and financial condition 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the reference price for or beyond 
there is legislation pending in congress that may impact the potential phase out of production tax credits for and the legislation would use the prior year oil price to determine the current year reference price 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this legislation 
the gain from the sale of synfuel facilities is comprised of fixed and variable components 
the fixed component represents note payments of principal and interest  is not subject to refund  and is recognized as a gain when earned and collectibility is assured 
the variable component is based on an estimate of tax credits allocated to our partners  is subject to refund based on the annual oil price phase out  and is recognized as a gain only when the probability of refund is considered remote and collectibility is assured 
additionally  based on estimates of tax credits allocated  our partners reimburse us through the project entity for the operating losses of the synfuel facilities 
in the event that the tax credit is phased out  we are contractually obligated to refund to our partners all or a portion of the operating losses funded by our partners 
to assess the probability of refund  we use valuation and analysis models that calculate the probability of surpassing the estimated lower band of the phase out range for the reference price of oil for the year 
due to the rise in oil prices  there was a possibility that the reference price of oil could have reached the threshold at which production tax credits would have begun to phase out 
we 
table of contents deferred all variable gains for the first three quarters of however  in the fourth quarter of  when there was persuasive evidence that the reference price of oil would not surpass the estimated lower band of the phase out range  we recognized all the variable gains related to  of which million pre tax were attributable to the first three quarters of due to changes in the agreements with certain of our synfuel partners and the exercise of existing rights by other of our synfuels partners  a higher percentage of the expected payments in may be variable note payments 
as a result  a larger portion of the synfuel payments may be subject to refund should a phase out occur 
we will likely defer recognition of the quarterly variable and certain indemnified fixed note payments in until the probability of refund is remote and collectibility is assured 
as discussed in note  we have entered into derivative and other contracts to economically hedge a portion of our and synfuel cash flow exposure related to the risk of oil prices increasing 
the derivative contracts are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains 
we recorded a pretax mark to market gain of million during as part of our synfuel related risk management strategy  we continue to evaluate alternatives available to mitigate unhedged exposure to oil price volatility 
these contracts  and other actions we can take and have taken  will protect approximately of our cash flow and of our cash flow 
as our risk management position changes due to market volatility or legislative actions  we may adjust our hedging strategy in response to changing conditions 
in addition to entering into economic hedges  we can mitigate our exposure to a tax credit phase out by shutting down or reducing production at our synfuel facilities  which decreases the amount of operating losses we generate 
we regularly monitor oil prices and have created contingency plans to cease synfuel production 
assuming no synfuel tax credit phase out  we expect cash flow from our synfuel business will be approximately billion from to if prices remain at current levels or increase throughout  synfuel production levels may be reduced  which would reduce the income and cash flow from this business 
if the reference price results in a complete phase out of the synfuel tax credits for  and assuming the previously discussed current level of economic hedges and an early cessation of synfuel production to avoid operating losses  there is a potential negative impact to net income and cash flow of million and million  respectively  before any potential asset impairment and goodwill write off 
unconventional gas production during the past year  natural gas prices have reached historically high levels 
these high prices provide attractive opportunities for our unconventional gas production business segment 
we are an experienced operator with years of experience in the antrim shale in northern michigan  and we recently expanded our operations in the barnett shale basin in north central texas 
recent leasehold acquisitions have increased our total leasehold acreage to  acres  net of interest of others 
over the next few years  our goal is to expand our existing leasehold acreage position and transform unproved acreage into proved reserves 
antrim shale we plan to grow through the extension of existing producing areas and acquisition of other producer s properties 
additionally  we intend to develop existing acreage using the latest horizontal drilling techniques and to continue to search for expansion acreage 
some of our long term fixed price obligations for production of antrim gas begin to expire in this will create opportunities to remarket antrim production at significantly higher current market rates

the gas produced in the antrim shale is subject to hedges that begin to expire in in  we expect to remarket bcf at current market pricing 
for  we anticipate remarketing an additional bcf 
barnett shale we anticipate significant opportunities in our existing barnett shale acreage and expect continued extension of producing areas within the fort worth basin 
we are currently in the test and development phase for unproved and recently acquired barnett shale acreage 
we plan to increase our acreage through small negotiated acquisitions to build scale

the estimated future net cash flow computations should not be considered to represent our estimate of the expected revenues or the current value of existing proved reserves and do not include the impact of hedge contracts 
due to high natural gas prices and the potential for successes within the barnett shale  more capital is being invested into the region 
the competition for opportunities and goods and services may result in increased operating costs 
however  our experience in the antrim shale and our experienced barnett shale personnel provide an advantage in addressing potential cost increases 
we expect to invest a combined amount of approximately million to million in our unconventional gas business in fuel transportation and marketing pipelines  processing and storage is in the process of expanding our storage capacity in michigan and expanding and building new pipeline capacity to the northeast united states 
our coal transportation 
table of contents and marketing business will seek to build our capacity to transport greater amounts of western coal and may seek to expand into coal terminals 
significant portions of the electric and gas marketing and trading portfolio are economically hedged 
the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory  as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions 
most financial instruments are deemed derivatives  whereas the gas inventory  pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives 
as a result  this segment may experience dramatic earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets 
this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different accounting periods 
we incur gains or losses in one period that are subsequently reversed when transactions are settled 
during  our earnings were negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision in early to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas 
the financial impact of this timing difference has begun to reverse as the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage 
in addition  we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts 
some of these underlying contracts are not derivatives  while the related economic hedges are derivatives  and therefore marked to market 
as a result  these transactions produce the timing related earnings swings from period to period 
we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will not be fully realized until operating system and performance excellence process we continuously review and adjust our cost structure and seek improvements in our processes 
beginning in  we adopted the dte energy operating system  which is the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in operating efficiencies  inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems  among other enhancements 
some of these cost reductions may be returned to our customers in the form of lower pscr charges and the remaining amounts may impact our profitability 
as an extension of this effort  in mid  we initiated a company wide review of our operations called the performance excellence process 
the overarching goal has been and remains to become more competitive by reducing costs  eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while improving customer service 
many of our customers are under intense economic pressure and will benefit from our efforts to keep down our costs and their rates 
additionally  we will need significant resources in the future to invest in the infrastructure necessary to compete 
specifically  we began a series of focused improvement initiatives within our electric and gas utilities  and our corporate support function 
the process will be rigorous and challenging and seeks to yield sustainable performance to our customers and shareholders 
we have identified the performance excellence process as critical to our long term growth strategy 
we are entering the implementation phase and expect to begin to realize the benefits from the effort in the cost to execute the performance excellence process could result in non recurring restructuring charges in capital investment we anticipate significant capital investment across all of our business segments 
most of our capital expenditures will be concentrated within our utility segments 
our electric utility currently expects to invest approximately billion due to increased environmental requirements and reliability enhancement projects through our gas utility currently expects to invest approximately million on system expansion  pipeline safety and reliability enhancement projects through the same period 
we plan to seek regulatory approval to include these capital expenditures within our regulatory rate base 
during  we began the first wave of implementation of dte  an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems 
we anticipate 
table of contents spending million to million over the next two years as the remaining system elements are developed and business segments fully adopt dte in the future  we may build a new base load electric generating plant 
the last base load plant constructed within our electric utility service territory was approximately twenty years ago 
a recently completed study  sponsored by the mpsc  projected that michigan may need to install  mw of additional capacity over the next ten years 
we estimate that a new base load plant will cost between billion and billion 
outlook the next few years will be a time of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry 
our strong utility base combined with our integrated non utility operations position us well for long term growth 
due to the enactment of the energy policy act of and the repeal of the public utility holding company act of there are fewer barriers to mergers and acquisitions of utility companies 
we anticipate greater industry consolidation over the next few years resulting in the creation of large regional utility providers 
looking forward  we will focus on several points that we expect will improve future performance continuing to pursue regulatory stability and investment recovery for our utilities  managing the growth of our utility asset base  enhancing our cost structure across all business segments  improving our electric and gas utility customer satisfaction  increasing the scale in our three non utility business segments  and investing in businesses that integrate our assets and leverage our skills and expertise 
along with pursuing a leaner organization  we expect to receive an estimated billion assuming no phase out of synfuel cash flow through  which consists of cash from operations  asset sales  and the utilization of production tax credits to reduce tax payments 
tax credit utilization in part could be extended past  if taxable income is reduced from current forecasts 
however  if oil prices remain at current levels or continue to increase  the estimated cash flow from the synfuel business would  as a result of production tax credit phase out  be significantly less and would adversely impact the success of this strategy  unless we identify alternative sources of cash 
anticipated redeployment of this expected available cash will reduce dte energy s debt and replace the value of synfuel operations inherent in our share price by pursuing investments in targeted energy markets 
if adequate investment opportunities are not available  share repurchases may be used to build shareholder value 
we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and financial coverage ratios  and paying an attractive dividend

electric utility our electric utility segment consists of detroit edison  which is engaged in the generation  purchase  distribution and sale of electricity to approximately million customers in southeastern michigan 
factors impacting income our net income increased million to million in from million in net income decreased million from million in these results primarily reflect higher rates due to the november mpsc final rate order  return of customers from the electric customer choice program  warmer weather and lower operations and maintenance expenses in  partially offset by a portion of higher fuel and purchased power costs  which were unrecoverable as a result of residential rate caps which expired january   and increased depreciation and amortization expenses 
in millions operating revenues fuel and purchased power gross margin operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income asset gains and losses  net operating income other income and deductions income tax provision net income operating income as a percent of operating revenues 
table of contents gross margins increased million during and declined million in operating revenues increased due to higher demand resulting from warmer weather in and increased rates due to the november mpsc final rate order  partially offset by unrecovered power supply costs as a result of residential rate caps which expired january  and a poor michigan economy in gross margins were favorably impacted by decreased electric customer choice penetration  whereby detroit edison lost of retail sales to electric customer choice customers in and of such sales during as retail customers migrated back to detroit edison as their electric generation provider rather than remaining with alternative suppliers 
the following table displays changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period increase decrease in gross margin components compared to prior year in millions weather related margin mpsc rate orders unrecovered power supply costs residential customers transmission charges electric customer choice program service territory economic performance other  net increase decrease in gross margin transmission expenses were recorded in operation and maintenance expense in operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs increased in reflecting a per mwh increase in fuel and purchased power costs during the year 
fuel and purchased power costs are a pass through with the reinstatement of the pscr mechanism  except for residential customers whose rate caps expired in january the increase in power supply costs was driven by higher seasonal demand  higher purchased power rates  higher coal prices and increased power purchases due to weather and plant outages 
pursuant to the mpsc final rate order  transmission expense  previously recorded in operation and maintenance expenses in  is now reflected in purchased power expenses 
the pscr mechanism provides related revenues for the transmission expense 
the decline in revenues was partially offset by increased base rates resulting from the interim and final rate orders 
revenues in were adversely impacted by reduced cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather 
in addition  operating revenues and fuel and purchased power costs decreased in reflecting a per mwh decline in fuel and purchased power costs 
the loss of retail sales under the electric customer choice program also resulted in lower purchase power requirements  as well as excess power capacity that was sold in the wholesale market 
under the interim and final rate orders  revenues from selling excess power reduce the level of recoverable fuel and purchased power costs and  therefore  do not impact margins associated with uncapped customers 
the rate orders also lowered pscr revenues  which were partially offset by increased base rate and transition charge revenues 
since fuel and purchased power costs are a pass through with the reinstatement of the pscr in  a decrease affects both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs but does not affect margins or earnings associated with uncapped customers 
the decrease in fuel and purchased power costs is attributable to lower priced purchases and the use of a more favorable power supply mix driven by higher generation output 
the favorable mix is due to lower purchases  driven by lost sales under the electric customer choice program

operation and maintenance expense decreased million in and increased million in as a result of the mpsc final rate order  transmission and miso expenses in are now included in purchased power expense with related revenues recorded through the pscr mechanism 
in addition  as a result of the mpsc final rate order  merger interest is no longer allocated from the dte energy parent company to detroit edison 
partially offsetting the lack of merger interest expense and the transmission expense accounting reclassification were higher storm expenses 
the increase reflects costs associated with maintaining our generation fleet  including costs of scheduled and forced plant outages 
additionally  the increase in is due to incremental costs associated with the implementation of our dte project 

table of contents bar chart operation and maintenance expense in both years includes higher employee pension and health care benefit costs due to financial market performance  discount rates and health care cost trend rates  and increased reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable  reflecting high past due amounts attributable to economic conditions 
in addition  we accrued a refund due from the midwest independent system operator in for transmission services 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in and increased million in the increases reflect the income effect of recording regulatory assets  which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses 
the regulatory asset deferrals totaled million in  million in and million in  representing net stranded costs and other costs we believe are recoverable under public act pa additionally  higher sales volumes compared to resulted in greater amortization of regulatory assets 
asset gains and losses  net increased million in as a result of our sale of land near our headquarters 
other income and deductions expense decreased million in and increased million in the decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense as a result of lower interest rates and a favorable adjustment related to tax audit settlements 
the increase is primarily due to lower income associated with recording a return on regulatory assets  as well as costs associated with addressing the structural issues of pa outlook we continue to improve the operating performance of detroit edison 
during the past year we have resolved many of our regulatory issues and continue to pursue additional regulatory solutions for structural problems within our competitive environment  mainly electric customer choice and the need to adjust rates for each customer class to reflect the full cost of service 
concurrently  we will move forward in our efforts to improve performance 
looking forward  additional issues  such as rising prices for coal  uranium and health care  continued under performance of michigan s economy and capital spending  will result in us taking meaningful action to address our costs while continuing to provide quality customer service 
we will utilize the dte operating system and the performance excellence process to seek opportunities to improve productivity  remove waste  decrease our costs  while improving customer satisfaction 
long term  we will be required to invest an estimated billion on emission controls through should we be able to recover these costs in future rate cases  we may experience a growth in earnings 
additionally  our service territory may require additional generation capacity 
a new base load generating plant has not been built within the state of michigan in the last years 
should our regulatory environment be conducive to such a significant capital expenditure  we may build or expand a new base load facility  with an estimated cost of billion to billion 

table of contents the following variables  either in combination or acting alone  will impact our future results amount and timing of cost recovery allowed as a result of regulatory proceedings  related appeals  or new legislation  our ability to reduce costs  variations in market prices of power  coal and gas  plant performance  economic conditions within the state of michigan  weather  including the severity and frequency of storms  and levels of customer participation in the electric customer choice program 
we expect cash flows and operating performance will continue to be at risk due to the electric customer choice program until the issues associated with this program are adequately addressed 
we will accrue as regulatory assets any future unrecovered generation related fixed costs stranded costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation and mpsc orders 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
see note gas utility our gas utility segment consists of michcon and citizens fuel gas company citizens  natural gas utilities subject to regulation by the mpsc 
michcon is engaged in the purchase  storage  transmission  distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately million residential  commercial and industrial customers in the state of michigan 
michcon also has subsidiaries involved in the gathering and transmission of natural gas in northern michigan 
michcon operates one of the largest natural gas distribution and transmission systems in the united states 
citizens distributes natural gas in adrian  michigan 
factors impacting income gas utility s net income increased million in and declined million in  compared to the prior year  primarily reflecting the impact of the mpsc s april gas cost recovery and final rate orders 
the mpsc final gas rate order disallowed recovery of of the costs of a computer billing system that was in place prior to dte energy s acquisition of mcn energy in michcon impaired this asset by approximately million in the first quarter of this disallowance was not reflected at the dte energy level since this impairment was previously reserved at the time of the mcn acquisition in in millions operating revenues cost of gas gross margins operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income asset gains and losses  net operating income other income and deductions income tax benefit net income operating income as a percent of operating revenues gross margins increased million in and increased million in  compared to the prior year 
gross margins in were favorably affected by higher base rates as a result of the interim and final gas rate orders  and revenue associated with the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism authorized by the mpsc 
in april  the mpsc issued an order in the gcr reconciliation case that disallowed million representing unbilled revenues at december we recorded the impact of the disallowance during the first quarter of operating revenues and cost of gas increased in 
table of contents reflecting higher gas prices which are recoverable from customers through the gcr mechanism 
the gross margin comparison was also affected by a million pre tax reserve recorded in for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to an mpsc order in michcon s gcr plan case 
see note gas markets in millions gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation other gas markets in bcf gas sales end user transportation intermediate transportation operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in the increase is primarily due to the impact of the mpsc rate order that disallowed certain environmental expenses that had been recorded as a regulatory asset and its requirement to defer negative pension expense as a regulatory liability 
for  uncollectible accounts receivables expense remained consistent with  reflecting higher past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices  continued weak economic conditions and inadequate government sponsored assistance for low income customers 
the final rate order provided revenue for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism to mitigate some of the effect of increasing uncollectible expense 
the increase in operation and maintenance expense was partially offset by the dte energy parent company no longer allocating merger related interest to michcon effective in april  as a result of the disallowance of those costs in the april final rate order 
the increase was also partially offset by a decline in accruals for injuries and damages during the period reflects higher reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and pension and health care costs 
the increase in uncollectible accounts expense reflects high past due amounts attributable to an increase in gas prices  continued weak economic conditions and a lack of adequate public assistance for low income customers 
bar chart asset gains and losses  net declined million in as a result of a write off of certain computer equipment and related depreciation resulting from the april final rate order 

table of contents income taxes increased by million in and decreased by million in due to variations in pre tax earnings 
outlook operating results are expected to vary as a result of factors such as regulatory proceedings  weather  changes in economic conditions  cost containment efforts and process improvements 
higher gas prices and economic conditions have resulted in continued pressure on receivables and working capital requirements partially mitigated by the gcr mechanism 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
in the april final gas rate order  the mpsc adopted michcon s proposed tracking mechanism for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each year  michcon will file an application comparing its actual uncollectible expense for the prior calendar year to its designated revenue recovery of approximately million 
ninety percent of the difference will be refunded or surcharged after an annual reconciliation proceeding before the mpsc 
non utility operations power and industrial projects power and industrial projects is comprised of coal based fuels  on site energy projects  non utility power generation  landfill gas recovery and waste coal recovery 
coal based fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from two coke battery plants 
the production of synthetic fuel from all of our synfuel plants and the production of coke from one of our coke batteries generate production tax credits 
on site energy projects include pulverized coal injection  power generation  steam production  chilled water production  wastewater treatment and compressed air supply 
non utility power generation owns and operates four gas fired peaking electric generating plants and manages and operates one additional gas fired power plant under contract 
landfill gas recovery develops  owns and operates landfill recovery systems throughout the united states 
waste coal recovery uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries typically discarded from coal mining operations 
factors impacting income net income increased million in and decreased million in  compared to these results primarily reflect higher gains recognized from selling interests in our synfuel plants  gains and losses on synfuel hedges  and varying levels of production tax credits 
in millions operating revenues operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income asset gains and losses  net operating income loss other income and deductions minority interest income taxes provision benefit production tax credits net income operating revenues increased million in and million in primarily reflecting higher synfuel sales due to increased production  and higher market prices for our coke production 
operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses  which have been more than offset by the resulting production tax credits 
when we sell an interest in a synfuel project  we recognize the gain from such sale as the facility produces and sells synfuel and 
table of contents when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the improvement in synfuel revenues results from increased production due to additional sales of project interests in  reflecting our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests in order to optimize income and cash flow 
bar graph revenues from on site energy projects increased in  reflecting the addition of new facilities  completion of new long term utility services contracts with a large automotive company and a large manufacturer of paper products 
revenues in include a million pre tax fee generated in conjunction with the development of a related energy project  of which was sold to an unaffiliated partner 
operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in  reflecting costs associated with increased synfuel production  acquisitions of three on site energy projects and coke operations 
partially offsetting higher synfuel operating costs was the recording of insurance proceeds associated with an accident at one of our coke batteries 
asset gains and losses  net increased million in and million in the improvements are due to increased production and sales volume from our synfuel projects 
to economically hedge our exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce synfuel sales proceeds  we entered into derivative and other contracts 
the derivative contracts are marked to market with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment to synfuel gains 
we recorded synfuel hedge mark to market gains of million  compared to mark to market losses of million 
see note minority interest increased million in and million in  reflecting our partners share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations 
the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during prior periods resulted in allocating a larger percentage of such losses to our partners 
income taxes increased million in and million in the increase in reflects higher taxable earnings  partially offset by higher production tax credits 
the increase in reflects higher taxable earnings and a decline in the level of production tax credits due to the sale of interests in synfuel facilities 
outlook we may sell additional interests in our synfuel plants and take actions to protect our expected synfuel cash flows from the risk of an oil price related phase out 
synfuel related tax credits expire on december  
table of contents in the third quarter of  we executed an agreement to purchase five on site energy projects and closed on three of the projects in power and industrial projects will continue leveraging its extensive energy related operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on site energy business 
we expect solid earnings from our on site energy business in production tax credits generated by our coal based fuels and landfill gas recovery businesses are subject to the same phase out risk if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels 
see note unconventional gas production unconventional gas production is primarily engaged in natural gas exploration  development and production 
our unconventional gas production business produces gas from the antrim and barnett shales and sells most of the gas to the fuel transportation and marketing segment 
factors impacting income net income decreased million in and decreased million in the decline in is due to higher operating and michigan severance tax expenses 
the decline in is due to increased interest costs and a gain that was recognized in as a result of a sale of a non core asset 
in millions operating revenues operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income operating income other income and deductions income tax provision net income operating revenues increased million in and increased million in due primarily to higher gas prices 
operations and maintenance expenses increased million in and increased million in increases are associated with the addition of approximately producing wells during the three year period 
the increase is also due to a million pretax gain on the sale of non core assets recorded in taxes other than income increased million in due to higher severance taxes associated with gas price increases 
other income and deductions decreased million in and increased million in interest expense was the primary contributor to the variances 
outlook we expect to continue to develop our proved areas  test unproved areas and prudently add new acreage in michigan and texas 
during we increased our acreage holdings by  acres  net of the interest of others in the antrim and barnett shales 
results from the barnett shale test wells drilled during are expected during the first half of we expect to invest a combined amount of approximately million to million in our unconventional gas business in 
table of contents fuel transportation and marketing fuel transportation and marketing consists of dte energy trading  coal transportation and marketing and the pipelines  processing and storage business 
dte energy trading focuses on physical power and gas marketing  structured transactions  enhancement of returns from dte energy s power plants and the optimization of contracted natural gas pipelines and storage capacity positions 
our customer base is predominantly utilities  local distribution companies  large industrials  and other marketing and trading companies 
we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our marketing and hedging activities 
most of the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method  which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
we utilize forwards  futures  swaps and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with our marketing and trading activity as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines 
dte energy trading is integral in providing commodity risk management services to the other unregulated businesses within dte energy 
coal transportation and marketing provides fuel  transportation and rail equipment management services 
we specialize in minimizing fuel costs and maximizing reliability of supply for energy intensive customers 
additionally  we participate in coal trading and coal to power tolling transactions  as well as the purchase and sale of emissions credits 
we recently initiated a new business line  coal mine methane extraction  in which we recover methane gas from mine voids for processing and delivery to natural gas pipelines  industrial users  or for small power generation projects 
pipelines  processing and storage has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline  seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field  as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field 
the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy operations 
factors impacting income net income decreased million in  consisting primarily of a million decline at dte energy trading associated with mark to market losses on gas storage hedges 
net income increased million in  consisting primarily of a million improvement at dte energy trading 
the comparability of results is impacted by a million one time pretax gain from a contract modification termination recorded in the first quarter of and significant mark to market losses on derivative contracts used to economically hedge our gas in storage and forward power contracts 
in millions operating revenues fuel  purchased power and gas operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income operating income loss other income and deductions income tax provision benefit net income operating revenues increased million in and increased million in both coal transportation and marketing and dte energy trading experienced revenue growth in due to higher demand  higher commodity pricing  the sale of emission credits and increased trading volume 
comparability of to is affected because our trading operations recorded an adjustment in that increased revenue by million related to the modification of a future purchase commitment under a transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company 
see note coal transportation and marketing revenues in were affected by our strategy to produce synfuel primarily from plants in which we had sold interests 
this strategy resulted in the reduction of synfuel 
table of contents production levels 
we were contractually obligated to supply coal to customers at certain sites that did not produce synfuel as a result of our production strategy 
to meet our obligations to provide coal under long term contracts with customers  we acquired coal that was resold to customers 
the coal was sold at prices higher than the prices at which synfuel would have been sold to these customers 
fuel  purchased power and gas increased million in and decreased million in during  our earnings have been negatively impacted by the economically favorable decision in early to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas 
we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost of gas in storage 
in addition  we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts 
we expect the timing difference on the forward power contracts will be fully realized by the end of in  our trading operations recorded a gas inventory adjustment that increased expense by million related to the termination of a long term gas exchange agreement with an interstate pipeline company 
see note under the gas exchange agreement  we received gas from the customer during the summer injection period and redelivered the gas during the winter heating season 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million in and increased million in during  our coal transportation and marketing business experienced higher throughput volumes and increased prices for coal 
the increase in was due primarily to increased coal purchases and increased lease expense 
other income and deductions for remained consistent with  and decreased million in the decline in is primarily due to gains recorded in from selling our pipeline interest in the portland natural gas transmission system 
income tax provision decreased million in and increased million in due to variations in earnings 
outlook we expect to continue to grow our coal services and dte energy trading businesses in a manner consistent with  and complementary to  the growth of our other business segments 
gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and custom tailored bundled services to large volume end users and utilities 
this capacity  coupled with the synergies from dte energy s other businesses  positions the segment to add value and mitigate risks 
we expect to continue to grow our pipeline  processing and storage business by expanding existing assets and developing new assets 
pipelines  processing and storage received mpsc approval in september and executed long term contracts for a capacity expansion at one of our michigan storage fields that will facilitate an additional bcf of storage service sales starting in april vector pipeline has secured long term market commitments to support an expansion project  for approximately mmcf per day  with a projected in service date of november vector pipeline expects to receive ferc approval in the second quarter of the millennium pipeline filed an application for ferc approval in august in addition  pipeline  processing and storage owns a interest in the millennium pipeline and is currently negotiating to increase its equity interest 
significant portions of the fuel transportation and marketing portfolio are economically hedged 
the portfolio includes financial instruments and gas inventory  as well as capacity positions of natural gas storage and pipelines and power transmission contracts 
the financial instruments are deemed derivatives  whereas the gas inventory  pipelines and storage assets are not derivatives 
as a result  we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets 
the majority of such earnings volatility is associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which does not coincide with the calendar and fiscal year  but runs annually from april of one year to march of the next year 
our strategy is to economically hedge the price risk of storage with over the counter forwards and futures 
current accounting rules require the marking to market of forward 
table of contents sales and futures  but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory 
this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods 
we generally anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse by the end of each storage cycle 
see fair value of contracts section that follows 
corporate other corporate other includes various corporate support functions such as accounting  legal and information technology services 
as these functions essentially support the entire company  their costs are fully allocated to the various segments based on services utilized 
therefore the effect of the allocation on each segment can vary from year to year 
additionally  corporate other holds certain non utility debt  assets held for sale  and energy related investments 
factors impacting income corporate other results declined million in  compared to a million improvement in the decline was primarily a result of the parent company not allocating merger interest to detroit edison and michcon 
partially offsetting increased expenses were reduced michigan single business taxes and gains on the sale of non strategic assets 
the improvement was affected by a million net of tax gain from the sale of million shares of plug power stock  as well as lower michigan single business taxes  resulting from tax saving initiatives 
corporate other also benefited from lower financing costs 
discontinued operations dte energy technologies dtech we own dtech  which assembles  markets  distributes and services distributed generation products  provides application engineering  and monitors and manages on site generation system operations 
in july  management approved the restructuring of this business resulting in the identification of certain assets and liabilities to be sold or abandoned  primarily associated with standby and continuous duty operations 
we recognized a net of tax restructuring loss of million during the third quarter of primarily representing the write down to fair value of the assets of dtech  less costs to sell  and the write off of goodwill 
as we execute the restructuring plan  there may be adjustments to amounts recorded related to the impairment and exit costs 
we anticipate completing the restructuring plan by mid southern missouri gas company we owned southern missouri gas company smgc  a public utility engaged in the distribution  transmission and sale of natural gas in southern missouri 
in the first quarter of  management approved the marketing of smgc for sale 
as of march   smgc met the criteria of an asset held for sale and we have reported its operating results as a discontinued operation 
we recognized a net of tax impairment loss of approximately million  representing the write down to fair value of the assets of smgc  less costs to sell  and the write off of allocated goodwill 
in november  we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of smgc 
regulatory approval was received in april and the sale closed in may during the second quarter of  we recognized a net of tax gain of million 
international transmission company in february  we sold international transmission company itc  our electric transmission business  to affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts co 
and trimaran capital partners  llc 
through december   we recorded a gain of million net of tax 
during the second quarter of  the gain was adjusted to million net of tax 
see note cumulative effect of accounting changes in the fourth quarter of  we adopted additional new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations 
the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced earnings by million 

table of contents on january   we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities 
the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced earnings by million 
see note capital resources and liquidity dte energy and its subsidiaries require cash to operate and is provided by both internally and externally generated sources 
we manage our liquidity and capital resources to maintain financial flexibility to meet our current and future cash flow needs 
cash requirements we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non utility businesses  retire and pay interest on long term debt and pay dividends 
our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in of up to billion 
the capital needs of our utilities will increase due primarily to environmental related expenditures 
we may spend an additional million to million on growth related projects within our non regulated businesses in capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in  primarily as a result of dte and environmental spending 
during  we began the first wave of implementation of dte  an enterprise resource planning system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems 
we anticipate spending million to million over the next two years as the remaining system elements are developed and business segments fully adopt dte we anticipate environmental capital expenditures of approximately million in and up to approximately billion of future capital expenditures to satisfy both existing and proposed new requirements 
we expect non utility capital spending will approximate million to million annually for the next several years 
capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria 
debt maturing in totals approximately million 
we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital requirements

our non utility businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles 
the profiles vary from our synthetic fuels business  which we believe will provide approximately billion of cash during assuming no phase out  to new startups 
these new start ups include our unconventional gas and waste coal recovery businesses  which we are growing and  if successful  could require significant investment 
cash from operations totaling billion in was up million from the comparable period 
the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over million in net income  after adjusting for non cash items depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred taxes and gains  substantially offset by a million increase in working capital and other requirements 
most of the improvement was driven by higher net income at detroit edison which was the result of improved revenues and gross margin stemming from higher rates granted in the rate orders  warmer weather  and lower customer choice penetration 
the offsetting increase in working capital requirements was driven by a million pscr under recovery in as compared to a million over recovery in working capital requirements also reflect the higher cost of gas at michcon and our fuel transportation and marketing segment 
michcon s working capital and other requirements were million higher in compared to primarily due to the impact of higher gas costs 
this impact was reflected by accounts receivable balances that were million higher at december  than the previous year at michcon 
the increase in working capital requirements was mitigated by lower income tax payments in and 
table of contents company initiatives to improve cash flow  including better inventory management  cash sales transactions and the utilization of letters of credit 
our net operating cash flow in was million  reflecting a million increase from the operating cash flow comparison reflects an increase of over million in net income  after adjusting for non cash items depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred taxes and gains  substantially offset by a million increase in working capital and other requirements 
a portion of this improvement is attributable to the change in our strategy to primarily produce synfuel from plants in which we have sold interests 
as previously discussed  synfuel projects generate operating losses  which have been more than offset by tax credits that we have been unable to fully utilize  thereby negatively affecting operating cash flow 
cash for working capital primarily reflects higher income tax payments of million in  reflecting a different payment pattern of taxes in compared to the increase in working capital was mitigated by company initiatives to improve cash flow  including better inventory management  cash sales transactions  deferral of retirement plan contributions and the utilization of letters of credit 
certain cash initiatives in lowered cash flow in outlook we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long term primarily due to improvements from utility rate increases and the sales of interests in our synfuel projects  partially offset by higher cash requirements on environmental and other utility capital as well as growth investments in our non utility portfolio 
we are likely to incur costs associated with implementation of our performance excellence process  but we expect to realize long term cost savings 
we also may be impacted by the delayed collection of underrecoveries of our pscr and gcr costs and electric and gas accounts receivable as a result of recent mpsc orders 
gas prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital improvement initiatives 
operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in due to the structure of the interim and final rate orders  we will begin to realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief in when all customer rate caps expire 
improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better management of our working capital requirements  including the continued focus on reducing past due accounts receivable 
our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be cash generation and conservation 
assuming no production tax credit phase out  cash flows from our synfuel business are expected to be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  including million tax credit carryforward utilization by dte energy 
the redeployment of this cash represents a unique opportunity to increase shareholder value and strengthen our balance sheet 
we expect to use this cash to reduce debt  to continue to pursue growth investments that meet our strict risk return and value creation criteria and to potentially repurchase common stock if adequate investment opportunities are not available 
our objectives for cash redeployment are to strengthen the balance sheet and coverage ratios to improve our current credit rating and outlook  and to replace the value of synfuel operations currently inherent in our share price 
however  if oil prices remain at current levels or increase throughout  the expected cash flow from the synfuel business would be less and could adversely impact the success of this strategy  unless the company identifies alternative sources of cash 
synfuel cash flow consists of variable and fixed payments from partners  proceeds from option and other contracts used to protect us from risk of loss from a tax credit phase out and the use of prior years tax credit carry forwards 
since  we have spent approximately million hedging our future synfuel cash flow and may spend up to million in our other operating non utility businesses are expected to contribute approximately million through remaining start up businesses such as unconventional gas production  waste coal recovery and distributed generation will continue to use cash in excess of their cash generation over the next couple of years while they are being further developed 
certain of the previously discussed cash initiatives resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in  which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in 
table of contents cash from investing activities cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets 
in any given year  we will look to realize cash from under performing or non strategic assets 
capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure  comply with environmental regulations and gas pipeline replacements 
capital spending within our non utility businesses is for ongoing maintenance and expansion 
the balance of non utility spending is for growth  which we manage very carefully 
we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy  management skills  risks and returns 
all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis 
we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria 
for new business lines  we invest tentatively based on research and analysis 
we start with a limited investment  we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results 
in any given year  the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 
net cash outflows relating to investing activities increased million in and million in  compared to the prior year 
the change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures  partially offset by higher synfuel proceeds 
spending on growth project investments increased million in while spending on environmental projects was million higher than the period 
the change was primarily due to proceeds received in totaling million from the sale of itc  interests in three synfuel projects and non strategic assets 
additionally  the change was due to variations in cash contractually designated for debt service 
longer term  with the expected improvement at our utilities and assuming continued cash generation from the synfuel business  cash flows are expected to improve 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion if we can find opportunities that meet our strategic  financial and risk criteria 
cash from financing activities we rely on both short term borrowing and long term financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by the company s operations 
short term borrowings  which are mostly in the form of commercial paper borrowings  provide us with the liquidity needed on a daily basis 
our commercial paper program is supported by our unsecured credit facilities 
our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity 
we continually evaluate our leverage target  which is currently or lower  to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 
we have completed a number of refinancings with the effect of extending the average maturity of our long term debt and strengthening our balance sheet 
the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates that lowered our debt costs 
net cash used for financing activities improved million in and improved million in  compared to the prior periods 
the improvement in was primarily driven by the issuance of common stock which resulted from the conversion of our equity security units 
the change in was primarily due to higher issuances of long term debt and levels of short term debt borrowings which exceeded the requirements of long term debt redemptions 
see note long term debt and preferred securities and note short term credit arrangements and borrowings for more information regarding financing activities 
amounts available under shelf registrations include million at dte energy  million at detroit edison and million at michcon

table of contents common stock issuances or repurchases can also be a source or use of cash 
in january  we announced that the dte energy board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million in common stock through the authorization provides company management with flexibility to pursue share repurchases from time to time  and will depend on future cash flows and investment opportunities 
no share repurchases were made in as of january   we discontinued issuing new dte energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan  which generated approximately million annually 
we also contributed million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of in august  we issued million shares of common stock in conjunction with the settlement of the stock purchase component of our equity security units

credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
management believes that the current credit ratings of the company provide sufficient access to the capital markets 
however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to the company may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors 
we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non utility subsidiaries 
in the event that our credit rating is downgraded to below investment grade  certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately million at december  additionally  upon a downgrade  our trading business could be required to restrict operations and our access to the short term commercial paper market could be restricted or eliminated 
while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade  we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews 
the following table shows our credit rating as determined by three nationally respected credit rating agencies 
all ratings are considered investment grade and affect the value of the related securities

such estimates relate to regulation  risk management and trading activities  production tax credits  goodwill  pension and postretirement costs  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and legal and tax reserves 
regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation 
detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
application of this standard results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non regulated businesses 
sfas no 
requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non regulated businesses 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some or all of our businesses 
if we were to discontinue the application of sfas no

derivative contracts are only marked to market to the extent that markets are considered highly liquid where objective  transparent prices can be obtained 
unrealized gains and losses are fully reserved for transactions that do not meet this criterion 
production tax credits we generate production tax credits from our synfuel  coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations 
we recognize earnings as tax credits are generated at our facilities in one of two ways 
first  to the extent we have sold an interest in our synfuel facilities to third parties  we recognize gains as synfuel is produced and sold  and when there is persuasive evidence that the sales proceeds have become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
second  to the extent we generate credits to our own account  we recognize earnings through reduced tax expense 
all production tax credits are subject to audit by the irs 
however  all of our synfuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations 
audits of five of our synfuel facilities were successfully completed in the past two years 
if production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit  there could be a significant write off of previously recorded earnings from such tax credits 
tax credits generated by our facilities were million in  as compared to million in and million in the portion of tax credits generated for our own account was million in  as compared to million in and million in  with the remaining credits generated allocated to third party partners 
goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 
in order to perform these impairment tests  we must determine the reporting unit s fair value using valuation techniques  which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance 
to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward  the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill  which would adversely impact our earnings 
as of december   our goodwill totaled billion 
the majority of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units  with million allocated to the gas utility reporting unit 
the value of the utility reporting units may be significantly impacted by rate orders and the regulatory environment 
the gas utility reporting unit is comprised primarily of michcon 
we have made certain assumptions for michcon that incorporate earnings multiples used in the cash flow valuations 
these assumptions may change as regulatory and market conditions change 
we also have million of goodwill allocated to the power and industrial projects reporting unit 
the value of the power and industrial projects reporting unit may be significantly impacted by any phase out of tax credits related to our synfuel business 
we have assumed there will be no phase out of synfuel tax credits and will monitor the status of any potential phase out and its impact on our valuation assumptions 
during we recorded an impairment of million to goodwill related to discontinuing the operations of dtech 

table of contents based on our goodwill impairment test  we determined that the fair value of our remaining operating reporting units exceed their carrying value and no impairment existed 
we will continue to monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ from our projections 
pension and postretirement costs our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors  including rates of return on plan assets  the discount rate  the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions 
we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of million in  million in  and million in postretirement benefits costs for all plans were million in  million in  and million in pension and postretirement benefits costs for are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our consultants  including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity and bond markets 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of in equity markets  in fixed income markets  and invested in other assets 
because of market volatility  we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate 
given market conditions  we believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets for we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually 
we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three year period 
accordingly  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
we have unrecognized net losses due to the performance of the financial markets 
as of december   we had million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the yield curve approach matches projected plan pension and postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans 
the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from at december  to at december  due to recent financial market performance  lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates  we estimate that our pension costs will approximate million compared to million in and our postretirement benefit costs will approximate million compared to million in in the last several years  we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs 
future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 
additionally  future pension costs for detroit edison will be affected by a pension tracking mechanism  which was authorized by the mpsc in its november rate order 
the tracking mechanism provides for the recovery or refunding of pension costs above or below the amount reflected in detroit edison s base rates 
in april  the mpsc approved the deferral of the non capitalized portion of michcon s negative pension expense 
michcon will record a regulatory liability for any negative pension costs  as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our qualified pension costs by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our pension costs by approximately million 
lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point 
table of contents would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for by approximately million 
the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by the financial markets 
the value of our plan assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december  the value at december  was billion 
the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize an additional minimum pension liability  an intangible asset and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders equity in   and the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow 
pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without substantial returns in the financial markets 
we made a million cash contribution in and a million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in we did not make pension contributions in we contributed million to our postretirement plans in we did not contribute to our postretirement plans in and we do not anticipate making a contribution to our qualified pension plans in at the discretion of management  we may make up to a million contribution to our postretirement plans in in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act was signed into law 
this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law 
the effects of the subsidy on the measurement of net periodic postretirement benefit costs reduced costs by million in and million in see note allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends  economic conditions  age of receivables and other information 
higher customer bills due to increased gas prices  the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables 
as a result of these factors  our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in and we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
as part of the rate order for michcon  the mpsc provided for the establishment of an uncollectible accounts tracking mechanism that partially mitigates the impact associated with michcon uncollectible expenses 
however  failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables in light of rising energy prices would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 
legal and tax reserves we are involved in various legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters  and establish reserves when appropriate 
legal reserves are based upon management s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the company 
tax reserves are based upon management s assessment of potential adjustments to tax positions taken 
we regularly review ongoing tax audits and prior audit experience  in addition to current tax and accounting authority in assessing potential adjustments 
environmental matters protecting the environment  as well as correcting past environmental damage  continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators 
legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility 
table of contents industry including detroit edison 
the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to clean up contaminated property 
electric utility air detroit edison is subject to epa ozone transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
in march  epa issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone  fine particulate  regional haze and mercury air pollution 
the new rules will lead to additional controls on fossil fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide  sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions 
to comply with these requirements  detroit edison has spent approximately million through we estimate detroit edison will incur future capital expenditures of up to million in and up to billion of additional capital expenditures through to satisfy both the existing and proposed new control requirements 
under the june michigan restructuring legislation  beginning january   annual return of and on this capital expenditure was deferred in ratemaking until december   the expiration of the rate cap period 
the epa has ongoing enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act 
detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject 
the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison 
in october  the epa promulgated revised regulations to clarify new source review provisions going forward 
several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and  in december  a stay was issued until the us court of appeals us circuit renders an opinion in the case 
we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison 
water detroit edison is required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities 
based on the results of the studies to be conducted over the next several years  detroit edison may be required to install additional control technologies to reduce the impacts of the intakes 
it is estimated that we will incur up to million over the next four to six years in additional capital expenditures to comply with these requirements 
contaminated sites detroit edison conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites  including two former mgp sites  the area surrounding an ash landfill and several underground and aboveground storage tank locations 
we have a reserve balance of million as of december  for the remediation of these sites over the next several years 
gas utility contaminated sites prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines  gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal  coke or oil 
gas utility owns  or previously owned  former mgp sites 
investigations have revealed contamination related to the by products of gas manufacturing at each site 
in addition to the mpg sites  gas utility is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites 
cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years 
as a result of these determinations  we have recorded liabilities of million and million for the mgps and other contaminated sites  respectively 
it is estimated that gas utility may incur million in expenses related to cleanup costs in while we cannot make any assurances  we believe that a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for the mgp sites  approved by the mpsc  will prevent these costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in  a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism was approved by the mpsc for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former mgp sites in excess of this reserve 
gas utility employed outside consultants to evaluate remediation alternatives for these sites  to assist in estimating its potential liabilities and to review its archived insurance policies 
as a result of these studies  gas utility accrued an additional liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of million during during  we spent approximately million investigating and remediating these former mgp sites 
in december  we retained multiple environmental consultants to estimate the projected cost to remediate each 
table of contents mgp site 
we accrued an additional million in remediation liabilities associated with two of our mgp sites  to increase the reserve balance to million at december  any significant change in assumptions  such as remediation techniques  nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements  could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and thereby affect the company s financial position and cash flows 
however  we anticipate the cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism approved by the mpsc will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
other our non utility affiliates are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants 
we are in the process of installing new environmental equipment at our coke battery facilities in michigan 
we expect the projects to be completed within two years at a cost of approximately million 
our other non utility affiliates are substantially in compliance with all environmental requirements 
various state and federal laws regulate our handling  storage and disposal of waste materials 
the epa and the mdeq have aggressive programs to manage the clean up of contaminated property 
we have extensive land holdings and  from time to time  must investigate claims of improperly disposed contaminants 
we anticipate our utility and non utility companies may periodically be included in various types of environmental proceedings 
dte in  we began the development of dte  an enterprise resource planning erp system initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems  relating to finance  human resources  supply chain and work management 
as part of this initiative  we are implementing enterprise business systems software including  among others  products developed by sap ag and mro software  inc the first phase of implementation occurred in in the regulated electric fossil generation unit 
full implementation throughout the company is not anticipated until the conversion of data and the implementation and operation of the erp will be continuously monitored and reviewed and should ultimately strengthen our internal control structure and lead to increased cost efficiencies 
although our implementation plan includes detailed testing and contingency arrangements to ensure a smooth and successful transition  we can provide no assurance that complications will not arise that could interrupt our operations 
we have spent approximately million through the end of and expect total spending over the life of the project to be between million and million 
we expect the benefits of lower costs  faster business cycles  repeatable and optimized processes  enhanced internal controls  improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs to outweigh the expense of our investment in this initiative 
midwest independent system operator miso the miso was formed in by its member transmission owners and in december received ferc approval as a regional transmission organization rto authorized to provide regional transmission services as prescribed by ferc in its order order requires an rto to perform eight functions  including tariff administration  transmission system congestion management  provision of ancillary services to support transmission operations  market monitoring  interregional coordination and the coordination of system planning and expansion 
miso s independence from ownership of either generation or transmission facilities is intended to enable it to ensure fair access to the transmission grid  and through its congestion management role  miso is also charged with ensuring grid reliability 
miso s initial provision of transmission services in december was known as day operations 

table of contents in keeping with order  which permits rtos to provide real time energy imbalance services and a market based mechanism for congestion management  miso  on april   launched its midwest energy market  or day operations  and began regional wholesale electric market operations and transmission service throughout its area 
a key feature of the midwest energy market is the establishment of locational marginal prices lmps which provide price transparency for the sale and purchase of wholesale electricity at different locations in the market territory 
the lmp is the market clearing price at a specific pricing location in the midwest energy market that is equal to the cost of supplying the next increment of load at that location 
the value of an lmp is the same whether a purchase or sale is made at that location 
detroit edison participates in the midwest energy market by offering its generation on a day ahead and real time basis and by bidding for power in the market to serve its load 
the cost of power procured from the market net of any gain realized from generation sold into the market is included and recovered through the pscr mechanism 
in addition  lmps are expected to encourage new generation to locate where the power produced is of most value to the load and is expected to identify where new transmission facilities are needed to relieve grid congestion 
miso is compensated for assuring grid reliability and for supporting the energy market through ferc approved rates charged to load 
detroit edison became a non transmission owning member of miso in compliance with section w of pa the mpsc has ordered that miso costs charged to detroit edison should be recovered through the pscr mechanism 
federal energy policy act of in august  the energy policy act of energy act was signed into law 
among other provisions  the energy act establishes mandatory electric reliability standards  repeals the public utility holding company act of  renews the price anderson act for twenty years which provides liability protection for nuclear power plants  increases funding levels for the low income home energy assistance program  and increases ferc oversight responsibilities for the electric utility industry 
the implementation of the energy act requires proceedings at the state level and development of regulations by the ferc  as well as other federal agencies 
the impact of the energy act on our results of operations will depend on the implementation of final rules and cannot be fully determined at this time 
new accounting pronouncements see note new accounting pronouncements for discussion of new pronouncements 
fair value of contracts the following disclosures are voluntary and provide enhanced transparency of the derivative activities and position of our trading businesses and our other businesses 
we use the criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  to determine if certain contracts must be accounted for as derivative instruments 
the rules for determining whether a contract meets the criteria for derivative accounting are numerous and complex 
moreover  significant judgment is required to determine whether a contract requires derivative accounting  and similar contracts can sometimes be accounted for differently 
if a contract is accounted for as a derivative instrument  it is recorded in the financial statements as assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities  at the fair value of the contract 
the recorded fair value of the contract is then adjusted quarterly to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract  a practice known as mark to market mtm accounting 

table of contents fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction 
to determine the fair value of contracts accounted for as derivative instruments  we use a combination of quoted market prices and mathematical valuation models 
valuation models require various inputs  including forward prices  volatility  interest rates  and exercise periods 
contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments are power  gas and oil forwards  futures  options and swaps  as well as foreign currency contracts 
items we do not generally account for as derivatives and which are therefore excluded from the following tables include gas inventory  gas storage and transportation arrangements  full requirements power contracts and gas and oil reserves 
as subsequently discussed  we have fully reserved the value of derivative contracts beyond the liquid trading timeframe thereby not impacting income 
the subsequent tables contain the following four categories represented by their operating characteristics and key risks 
proprietary trading represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view  capturing market price changes  or putting capital at risk 
this activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure 
structured contracts represents derivative activity transacted with the intent to capture profits by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers  utilities  retail aggregators and alternative energy suppliers 
although transactions are generally executed with a buyer and seller simultaneously  some positions remain open until a suitable offsetting transaction can be executed 
economic hedges represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by dte energy  including forward sales of gas production and trades associated with owned transportation and storage capacity 
changes in the value of derivatives in this category economically offset changes in the value of underlying non derivative positions  which do not qualify for fair value accounting 
the difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility as discussed in more detail in the preceding results of operations section 
other non trading activities primarily represent derivative activity associated with our michigan gas reserves and synfuel operations 
a substantial portion of the price risk associated with the gas reserves has been mitigated through changes in the value of the hedges are recorded as assets or liabilities from risk management and trading activities  with an offset in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are deemed effective 
oil related derivative contracts have been executed to economically hedge cash flow risks related to underlying  non derivative synfuel related positions through the amounts shown in the following tables exclude the value of the underlying gas reserves and synfuel proceeds including changes therein

our intent is to recognize mtm activity only when pricing data is obtained from active quotes and published indexes 
actively quoted and published indexes include exchange traded ie  nymex and over the counter positions for which broker quotes are available 
although the nymex has currently quoted prices for the next months  broker quotes for gas and power are generally available for and months into the future  respectively  we fully reserve all unrealized gains and losses related to periods beyond the liquid trading timeframe and which therefore do not impact income 
as a result of adherence to generally accepted accounting principles  the tables above do not include the expected favorable earnings impacts of certain non derivative gas storage and power contracts 
we entered into economically favorable transactions in early to delay previously planned withdrawals from gas storage due to a decrease in the current price for natural gas and an increase in the forward price for natural gas 
we anticipate the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse when the gas is withdrawn from storage in the current storage cycle and is sold at prices significantly in excess of the cost 
table of contents of gas in storage 
in addition  we entered into forward power contracts to economically hedge certain physical and capacity power contracts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk dte energy has commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in conjunction with the anticipated purchases of coal  uranium  and electricity to meet its obligations during periods of peak demand 
we also are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations on gas sale and purchase contracts  gas production and gas inventories 
to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations  we have entered into a series of electricity and gas futures  forwards  option and swap contracts 
commodity price risk associated with our electric and gas utilities is limited due to the pscr and gcr mechanisms 
see note our coal based fuels and landfill gas recovery businesses are also subject to crude oil price risk 
as previously discussed  production tax credits generated by dte energy s synfuel  coke battery and landfill gas recovery operations are subject to phase out if domestic crude oil prices reach certain levels 
we have entered into a series of derivative contracts for through to economically hedge the impact of oil prices on a portion of our synfuel cash flow 
see note credit risk bankruptcies we purchase and sell electricity  gas  coal  coke and other energy products from and to numerous companies operating in the steel  automotive  energy  retail and other industries 
certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the u 
s 
bankruptcy code 
we regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and our purchase and sale contracts and we record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss 
we believe our previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss 
the final resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
other we engage in business with customers that are non investment grade 
we closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and  when deemed necessary  we request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations

interest rate risk dte energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt and preferred securities 
in order to manage interest costs  we use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in us treasury rates  commercial paper rates and london inter bank offered rates libor 
as of december   the company has a floating rate debt to total debt ratio of approximately excluding securitized debt 
foreign currency risk dte energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts 
these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of power as well as for long term transportation capacity 
to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we have entered into a series of currency forward contracts through additionally  we may enter into fair value currency hedges to mitigate changes in the value of contracts or loans 
summary of sensitivity analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis to calculate the fair values of our commodity contracts  long term debt instruments and foreign currency forward contracts
