net sales increased in fiscal  which was on top of an increase in fiscal the majority of this growth was related to new stores as our comparable store sales were up in fiscal the comparable store sales growth was hindered by a shift in the marketplace to low profile  sport fusion footwear  as well as fewer strong new technology introductions in fiscal our merchandising team has been  and will continue to work closely with merchandise vendors to adapt to the consumer changes in an effort to predict the shifts before they occur so that we are merchandised appropriately within the stores

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventory  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the cost associated with acquiring merchandise from vendors  occupancy costs  provision for inventory shortages  and credits and allowances from our merchandise vendors following emerging issues task force eitf accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf guidance 
because the company does not include the costs associated with operating the distribution facility and freight within cost of sales  the company s gross profit may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in costs of sales and in the calculation of gross profit 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store payroll and related payroll benefits  store operating expenses  advertising  cooperative advertising allowances following eitf guidance  costs associated with operating our distribution facility and freight  including moving merchandise from our distribution center to stores  and other corporate related expenses 
valuation of inventory 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
the company s valuation of inventory includes a markdown reserve for merchandise that will be sold below cost and a shrink reserve 
the markdown reserve value is based upon historical information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the shrink reserve value is based on historical information and assumptions as to current shrink trends 
it is possible that changes to the markdown and shrink reserves could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions 
vendor allowances 
the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the consolidated statements of income when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendors participation in the reduction of the selling price of merchandise fluctuates based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the leased space for buildout 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences  tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
these assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition  management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdictions and to consider this when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
a one percent change in the company s overall statutory tax rate for would not have a material effect in the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability 
the company has operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals of tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r fas r  share based payment  a revision of fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
fas r requires the measurement of all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to certain employee stock purchase plans  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of fas r for the company are effective  and will be adopted  beginning february   the beginning of the next fiscal year 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
fas r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also requires entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under fas for the pro forma disclosure 
the company will adopt using the modified prospective alternative 
the adoption of fas r is expected to have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of fas r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts for the fiscal years ended   presented as if the company had used a fair value based method similar to a method allowed under fas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock based compensation awards 
fas r also requires tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax deductions for future periods cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as they depend on the timing of stock option exercises and the company s share price on the exercise date 
excess tax deductions for the fiscal years ended   and have been separately classified as tax benefit from exercise of stock options in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r fsp r 
fas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards when the award has been granted 
one of the criteria for determining that an award has been granted is that the employer and its employees have a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award 
under fsp r  a mutual understanding is assumed to exist on the date the award is approved by the board of directors and the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to the individual within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
fsp r is applicable upon initial adoption of fas r 
as required  the company will apply the guidance in fsp r beginning february  concurrently with the adoption of fas r 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
fas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
this statement requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of a change 
fas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
eitf provides guidance on the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either acquired after the beginning of the initial lease term or acquired as the result of a business combination 
this guidance requires leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term to be amortized over the shorter of the assets useful life or a term that includes the original lease term plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
this guidance is required to be applied to leasehold improvements acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp no 
 to give guidance to a lessee on determining whether rental costs associated with operating leases may be capitalized during a construction period 
fsp no 
stipulates that such costs shall be a recognized as rental expense  b included in income from continuing operations  and c allocated over the lease term according to the guidance in fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
the guidance in fsp no 
is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for financial statements or interim financial statements that have not yet been issued 
the company already accounts for such rental costs in accordance with fsp no 
 therefore  the adoption of fsp no 
will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
