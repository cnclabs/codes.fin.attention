table of contents critical accounting policy the company s critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for losses on loans 
it is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is established through allocations of dealer discount and a portion of unearned income and a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance 
because of the nature of the customers under the company s contracts and its direct loan program  the company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative 
the company segregates its contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses 
all contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool 
the company pools contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase contracts in different geographic markets 
this method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate 
the pools also allow the company to evaluate the different levels of customer income  stability  credit history  and the types of vehicles purchased in each market 
each such static pool consists of the contracts purchased by a branch office during the fiscal quarter 
contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual contract by contract basis 
individual contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally the lesser of state maximum interest rates or the maximum interest rate at which the customer will accept 
in certain markets  competitive forces will drive down contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual contract 
the company only buys contracts on an individual basis and never purchases contracts in batches  although the company does consider portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
the company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which contracts to purchase 
these guidelines are specific and are designed to cause all of the contracts that the company purchases to have common risk characteristics 
the company utilizes its district managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines 
the company also utilizes an internal audit department to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines 
the company utilizes the branch model  which allows for contract purchasing to be done on the branch level 
each branch manager may interpret the guidelines differently  and as a result  the common risk characteristics tend to be the same on an individual branch level but not necessarily compared to another branch 
a dealer discount represents the difference between the finance receivable  net of unearned interest  of a contract  and the amount of money the company actually pays for the contract 
the discount negotiated by the company is a function of the credit quality of the customer and the wholesale value of the vehicle 
the automotive dealer accepts these terms by executing a dealer agreement with the company 
the entire amount of discount is related to credit quality and is considered to be part of the credit loss reserve 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance 
a static pool retains an amount equal to of the discount as a reserve for credit losses 

table of contents subsequent to the purchase  if the reserve for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool which is not fully liquidated  then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to reestablish adequate reserves 
if a static pool is fully liquidated and has any remaining reserves  the excess discounts are immediately recognized into income and the excess provision is immediately reversed during the period 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are determined to have excess discounts  such excess amounts are accreted into income over the remaining life of the static pool 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are deemed to have excess reserves  such excess amounts are reversed against provision for credit losses during the period 
in analyzing a static pool  the company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the branch office  the performance of prior contracts purchased from the dealers whose contracts are included in the current static pool  the credit rating of the customers under the contracts in the static pool  and current market and economic conditions 
each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary 
fiscal compared to fiscal interest income and loan portfolio interest income on finance receivables  predominantly finance charge income  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the average finance receivables  net of unearned interest  totaled million for the year ended march   an increase of from million for the year ended march  the primary reason average finance receivables  net of unearned interest increased was the increase in the receivable base of several existing branches and the opening of seven additional branch locations 
the gross finance receivable balance increased to million at march  from million at march  the primary reason interest income increased was the increase in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the gross portfolio yield increased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the net portfolio yield increased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the gross portfolio yield increased due to a combination of a change to reflect interest earned on a contractual basis  as opposed to on the basis of expected yield see discussion under analysis of credit losses below  together with increases in accretion of discounts due to improved portfolio performance 
the net portfolio yield increased due to the above factors  net of additional provisions for credit losses required for the change in the recognition of interest and the resulting affect on credit loss provisions 
computer software business sales for the fiscal year ended march  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from the existing customer base during the fiscal year ended march  cost of sales and operating expenses decreased from  for the fiscal year ended march  to  for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was attributed to the decrease in sales for the fiscal year ended march  operating expenses total expenses  less the provision for credit losses  interest expense and costs associated with nds  increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase of was primarily attributable to the additional staffing at several existing branches  increased general operating expenses and the opening of seven additional branch offices 
operating expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables  net of unearned interest  increased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents interest expense interest expense increased from million for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the average indebtedness for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the average cost of borrowed funds increased from during the fiscal year ended march  to during the fiscal year ended march  analysis of credit losses as of march   the company had active static pools 
the average pool upon inception consisted of contracts with aggregate finance receivables  net of unearned interest  of approximately  prior to the april   in situations where  at the date of purchase  the dealer discount was determined to be insufficient to absorb all potential credit losses associated with a static pool  a portion of unearned income associated with the static pool was allocated to the reserve for dealer discounts 
for loans purchased prior to april  the company recognized revenue on the basis of interest expected to be collected  which was the gross contractual interest less amounts allocated to the reserve for dealer discounts 
effective with loans purchased after march   the company discontinued the practice of allocating a portion of unearned income to the reserve for dealer discounts 
this change was made to reflect the predominate practice in the industry and improve comparability with other companies within the finance industry 
effective with loans purchased after march  the company began recognizing interest income based upon the contractual rate of the loan 
in situations where the discount is determined to be insufficient to absorb all potential losses associated with the static pool  a charge to income is provided into provision for credit losses over the remaining life of the pool 
the change in the practice of allocating a portion of the unearned income to reserves for dealer discounts did not have a significant effect on the periodic net operating results  but rather resulted in differences in the classification of amounts within the statement of income 
both interest income and provisions for credit losses were higher for those pools acquired during the year ended march  than those pools acquired prior to such period 
in addition  while this change has not significantly changed the net finance receivables as reported  the components of net finance receivables have changed as unearned interest as a percentage of gross contracts has increased as a result of the change and will be followed in subsequent periods by increases in the allowance for credit losses

fiscal year ended march  balance at beginning of year current period provision losses absorbed recoveries balance at end of year allowance as a percent of gross direct loan receivables reserves accreted into income for the year ended march  were approximately million as compared to million for the year ended march  there were no provisions reversed for the year ended march  or march  the primary reasons for the increase in reserves accreted during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  was a decrease in the net charge off percentage from to and an increase in the size of the portfolio 
the company experienced a lower net charge off percentage during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  this resulted in static pools having reserves in excess of estimates currently needed to liquidate these pools 
the amount and timing of reserves accreted into income is a function of individual static pool performance 
the company has seen improvement in the performance of the portfolio and attributes this decrease to an improvement in overall general economic conditions 
the company is in the process of accreting these excess reserves from these more mature static pools over their remaining life 
the average dealer discount associated with new volume for the years ended march  and was 
the provision for credit losses increased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  largely due to the change in interest recognition and the effect on provisions for credit losses on loans originated after march  the company s losses as a percentage of liquidation decreased from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  the longer term outlook for portfolio performance will depend on the overall economic conditions  the unemployment rate and the company s ability to monitor  manage and implement its underwriting philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion 
the company does not believe there have been any significant changes in loan concentrations  terms or quality of contracts purchased during fiscal that would have contributed to the decrease in losses 
recoveries as a percentage of charge offs were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company believes that as it continues to expand its operations  it will become more difficult to implement its loss recovery model in geographic areas further away from its corporate headquarters  and as a result the company will likely experience declining recovery rates over the long term 

table of contents the us unemployment rate has dropped slightly over the past year 
the company believes there is a correlation between the unemployment rate and future portfolio performance 
the company does not expect the us unemployment rate to rise or fall significantly in the foreseeable future 
therefore the company does not plan on increasing or decreasing reserves based on the current us unemployment rate 
the company also analyzes bankruptcy filings  voluntary repossession rates and the results of internal branch audits to measure the credit quality of its respective branches as other tools to predict future portfolio performance 
these indicators have not changed materially in the past year and the company does not anticipate any change to reserve levels as such 
the delinquency percentage for contracts more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage for direct loans more than thirty days past due as of march  decreased to from as of march  the company does not give significant consideration to short term trends in delinquency when evaluating reserve levels 
delinquency percentages tend to be volatile and are not necessarily an indication of future losses 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to analyzing portfolio performance and looks at specific static pool performance and recent trends as leading indicators to future performance of the portfolio

reserves accreted into income for the fiscal years ended march  and were million and million respectively 
the amount and timing of reserves accreted into income is a function of individual static pool performance 
the company has seen improvement in the performance of the portfolio  more specifically  newer static pools have seen a slight decrease in the default rate when compared to prior year pool performance during their same liquidation cycle

income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year primarily as a result of higher pretax income 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was an increase in the amount of taxable income subject to higher graduated tax rates associated with federal income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows are summarized as follows fiscal year ended march  cash provided by used in operations investing activities primarily purchase of contracts financing activities net increase decrease in cash the company s primary use of working capital during fiscal year ended march  was the funding of the purchase of contracts 
the contracts were financed substantially through borrowings under the company s million line 
the line is secured by all of the assets of nicholas financial 
the company may borrow the lesser of million or amounts based upon formulas principally related to a percentage of eligible finance receivables  as defined 
borrowings under the line may be under various libor pricing options or at the prime rate 
prime rate based borrowings are generally less than million 
as of march   the amount outstanding under the line was approximately million and the amount available under the line was approximately million 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements  each of which effectively converts a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate  thus reducing the impact of interest rate change on the company s interest expense 
at march   approximately of the company s borrowings under the line were subject to interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements have maturities ranging from august  through september  
table of contents the self liquidating nature of contracts and other loans enables the company to assume a higher debt to equity ratio than in most businesses 
the amount of debt the company incurs from time to time under these financing mechanisms depends on the company s need for cash and ability to borrow under the terms of the line 
the company believes that borrowings available under the line as well as cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short term funding needs

the company s board of directors also approved the discontinuation of the payment of an annual cash dividend of per share 
the board determined that it would be advisable  for the foreseeable future  to utilize after tax profits to pursue continued growth 
the board of directors will continue to review its dividend policy on an annual basis 
impact of inflation the company is affected by inflation primarily through increased operating costs and expenses including increases in interest rates 
inflationary pressures on operating costs and expenses have been offset by the company s continued emphasis on stringent operating and cost controls 
management believes that the company s financial condition has enabled it to negotiate favorable interest rates under its existing line 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to continue to do so in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s material obligations as of march  years ending march  total operating leases line of credit total 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
there was no ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swap agreements during the year ended march
