critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our contracts  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that revenue recognition is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period  which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the failure of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have a number of contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without affecting overall profitability 
however  significant changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue from change orders on contracts that have been approved as to scope but not price  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount that we currently expect to recover from customers in relation to costs incurred by us for changes in contract specifications or designs  or other unanticipated additional costs 
revenue relating to change order claims is recognized only if it is probable that the revenue will be realized 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
revenue recognition the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
to minimize increases in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors 
as soon as we are advised that our bid is the lowest  we enter into firm contracts with our materials suppliers and sub contractors  thereby mitigating the risk of future price variations affecting the contract costs 
the principal remaining risks under fixed price contracts relate to labor and equipment costs and productivity 
as a result  we page 
table of contents have rarely been exposed to material price or availability risk on contracts in our contract backlog 
such quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we therefore have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related profit 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to finish uncompleted contracts 
our cost estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our contracts can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of contracts of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a more significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the contract and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 
valuation of long term assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
in addition  we had goodwill with a value of approximately million at december   which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas the impairment testing required by sfas requires considerable judgment  and an impairment charge may be required in the future 
we completed our annual impairment review for goodwill effective october   and it did not reveal impairment 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our page 
table of contents deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
because realization of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards  or nol s  is not assured  our valuation allowance at the respective time represents the amount of the deferred tax assets that we determine are more likely than not to expire unutilized 
reflecting management s assessment of expected future operating profitability  we expect to utilize all remaining nol s and therefore eliminated our valuation allowance in we reduced our valuation allowance in and by million and  respectively 
income taxes as of december   we had nol s of approximately million  which will expire from time to time during the years through as discussed below 
the exercise of significant numbers of in the money options by employees  resulting in tax deductible compensation expense to the company  would reduce the level of future taxable income and therefore the rate at which nol s are utilized 
we currently expect that our nol s will have been fully utilized by an ownership change  which may occur if there is a transfer of ownership exceeding of our outstanding shares of common stock in any three year period  may lead to a limitation in the usability of  or a potential loss of some or all of  the nol s 
in order to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change occurring  our certificate of incorporation  as amended  prohibits transfers of our common stock resulting in  or increasing  individual holdings in excess of of our common stock  unless such transfer is made by us or with the consent of our board of directors 
because the regulations governing nol s are highly complex and may be changed from time to time  and because our attempts to prevent an ownership change from occurring may not be successful  the nol s could be limited or lost 
we believe that the nol s are currently available in full  however  and intend to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that they will remain available 
to the extent the nol s become unavailable to us  our future taxable income and that of any consolidated affiliate will be subject to federal taxation  thus reducing funds otherwise available for corporate purposes 
discontinued operations in august  our board of directors authorized management to sell our distribution business 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we determined that the distribution business became a long lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation in the third quarter of consequently  we have reclassified the operating results of the distribution business from continuing operations in our statement of operations for all periods presented 
we do not expect to incur a loss on the disposal of our distribution business

the revenue increase from to  which includes an increase in revenues from state highway work of million  or  to million and an increase in municipal revenues of million  or  to million was due to several factors  including a growing contract backlog  which enabled us to expand our equipment fleet and to hire more field crews  especially in the san antonio and austin markets  the continuing expansion of our construction capabilities  which allowed us to bid for and take on larger and more complex work  certain water main contracts that included large diameter pipe  facilitating greater revenues to be generated by our crews  the increase in the proportion of state highway contracts  which generally allow greater revenue production from our equipment and work crews  and generally better weather during which allowed for continuous work on construction contracts  compared with one of the wettest years on record in gross profit 
the improvement in gross profits in was due principally to the revenue increase  combined with the slightly higher gross margins 
the margin improvement was attributable to the gradual improvement in gross margins in our contract backlog during combined with improved productivity resulting from good weather during the year and the efficiencies arising from having a greater number of larger and longer duration contracts in work than in the past 
contract backlog 
the million increase in contract backlog reflected the on going broadening of our service platform and the continuation of a favorable bidding climate in our markets  and included the winning of several large contracts particularly two txdot contracts with an aggregate value of million and a million contract with travelers casualty and surety company to complete a txdot contract taken over by travelers after a default by the original contractor 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
the increase in general and administrative  or g a  expenses in was principally due to higher employee expenses  including an increase in staff  increased variable compensation resulting from our improved profits  and higher legal and accounting fees 
despite these increases in g a expenses in support of the growing business  the significantly higher revenues in meant that the ratio of g a expenses to revenue decreased from in to in operating income 
the increase in operating income and operating margin resulted from the higher gross margins and lower ratio of g a expenses to revenues 
interest expense net of interest income 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted from a  increase in interest income earned on available cash balances 
minority interest 
because we acquired the remaining of sterling houston holdings  inc in december  no minority interest expense was recorded in page 
table of contents income taxes 
in both and we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset following management s review of the likelihood that tax loss carryforwards would be substantially utilized in the future 
this resulted in an effective tax rate of in and a tax credit in net income from continuing operations 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was the result of the factors discussed above and resulted in the increase in basic and diluted income per common share from continuing operations 
effect of income tax benefits 
although we have the benefit of significant nol s  which shelter most of our income from federal income taxes  we are required to reflect a full tax charge in our financial statements through an adjustment to the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain adjustments resulting from our recovery of the deferred tax asset are recorded in the income statement 
those adjustments resulted in a benefit of million in and million in assuming an income tax rate of  and disregarding adjustments to our deferred tax asset and other timing differences  net income would have been million for and million for  and on the same basis  basic and fully diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share would have been and  respectively  for compared with and  respectively  for a reconciliation of reported net income for and to net income as if a tax rate had been applied is set forth in the table below

table of contents revenue 
the decrease in revenues from to was due to several factors  including a decrease in business with the city of houston and harris county  texas which in turn was result of the completion of several large contracts in the decrease was offset in part by an increase of million  or  in state highway business due principally to the acquisition of the kinsel construction business 
we also encountered adverse weather conditions in the second and fourth quarters of which significantly reduced the number of available workdays on several of our contracts 
gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit reflects the lower revenues in and the decrease in gross margins 
the decrease in gross margins was due to higher fixed cost absorption rates because of the lower revenues and weather related delays combined with a lower average gross margin in the contracts completed during we also experienced losses on several construction contracts in the dallas market 
in contrast  gross margins in were unusually high due to both the mix in types of contracts and favorable weather conditions 
contract backlog 
we began with a contract backlog of million 
during the year  the bidding climate improved and that  coupled with our broadening service platform  resulted in our successfully competing for a variety of larger  multi year contracts 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
in we had a million increase in our liability related to the acquisition of the remaining of sterling houston holdings  inc whilst this increase was not repeated in  g a increased in as a result of the listing of our common stock on the american stock exchange  the hiring of a public relations firm  and expenses related to the conversion of zero coupon notes into five year notes upon the acquisition of the of sterling houston holdings 
operating income 
operating income decreased in as a result of the decline in revenues and related gross profits  which were not off set by a concomitant decline in g a expenses 
interest expense  net of interest income 
the decrease in interest expense in was a result of lower interest rates on our credit facility with comerica bank  which we refer to as the construction business revolver 
minority interest 
in both and we recorded a minority interest expense attributable to the of sterling houston holdings that we did not acquire until december however  there was a reduction in the minority interest expense in because of the lower level of operating profits 
income taxes 
in we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset following management s review of the likelihood that tax loss carryforwards would be used in the future 
the effective tax rate of in was less than the expected rate because of the utilization of million of nol s against current taxable income 
net income from continuing operations 
the decrease in net income from continuing operations in was the result of the factors discussed above 
while basic income per common share from continuing operations was unchanged in  the decline in diluted income per common share from continuing operations resulted from an increase in the number of common shares outstanding which was the result of the issuance of common stock in partial payment for the remaining of sterling houston holdings

discontinued operations for and represent the results of operations of steel city products  llc 
the increase in discontinued operations was due to an increase in sales in of million  or  arising from increased automotive sales and promotional orders of pet supplies which was offset by a small decrease in sales of lawn and garden products 
gross profit margins remained relatively flat

table of contents operating activities significant non cash items included in operating activities for were depreciation and amortization  which totaled million  an increase of million from  as a result of the continued increase in the size of our construction fleet  and tax expense  which increased by million during due principally to the increase in operating income and a reduction in the benefit arising from the reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset 
although we have the benefit of significant nol s which shelter most of our income from federal income taxes  we are required to reflect a full tax charge in our financial statements  through an adjustment to the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain adjustments resulting from our revaluation of the deferred tax asset are recorded in the income statement 
in addition to the significant increase in income during  working capital components excluding cash increased by million compared with the significant components of the changes in working capital are as follows there was a decrease of million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in compared with an increase of million in these changes reflect the resolution of timing differences as contracts progress  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by million in  whereas in there was a decrease of million 
these changes principally reflect fluctuations in the timing and amount of mobilization payments to assist in the start up on certain contracts  trade payables increased by million in compared with an increase of million in  principally reflecting the increased level of revenues in  and contracts receivable increased by million in compared with a slight decrease in  principally reflecting the revenue increase and related level of customer retentions 
investing activities expenditures to expand our construction fleet were million in compared with million during the much enlarged contract backlog required a significant expansion of our fleet in investing activities during included the payment of net cash of million upon the acquisition of the minority interest of sterling houston holdings 
financing activities cash provided by operations combined with the increased level of working capital more than offset the high level of capital expenditures in and the funding of net long term debt repayments of million  resulting in a substantial increase in our cash position at year end 
in cash increased by million of which only million was derived from an increase in borrowings under our revolving lines of credit 
during  there was an increase in borrowings under the lines of credit of million because capital expenditures  long term debt repayments and working capital requirements exceeded cash provided by operations 
funds received from the exercise of warrants by north atlantic smaller companies investment trust plc  or nascit  and the exercise of options by employees and directors  totaled  during compared with option exercise proceeds of  in liquidity the level of working capital for our construction business varies due to fluctuations in the levels of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  and of billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings  the size and status of contract mobilization payments  of customer receivables and of contract retentions  and the level of amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 
some of these fluctuations can be significant 
sources of capital in addition to cash provided from operations  we use our revolving lines of credit to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures
