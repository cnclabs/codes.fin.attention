item a 
risk factors introduction in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we have made business acquisitions in recent years and we expect to be an active business acquirer in the future 
we anticipate that we will seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services in the future 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks  including the operations  technology and personnel of an acquired business may be difficult to integrate  an acquired business may not achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flow  the allocation of management resources to complete a business acquisition may disrupt our day to day business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of an acquired business successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of any business combination 
the business in which we compete is highly competitive and there is no assurance that our current products and services will stay competitive or that we will be able to introduce new products and services to compete successfully 
the financial payment processing market in which we operate is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  merchant requirements  pricing competition  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and rapid rates of new product introduction 
our market share is relatively small as compared to most of our competitors and many of our competitors have greater technical  financial and marketing resources than us and  as a result  may be able to respond more quickly to changes in technology  industry standards and merchant requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to product development and marketing than us 
there can be no assurance that our curren t products and services will not become obsolete or that we will have the financial  technical and marketing resources and support facilities to compete successfully in the future 
we believe that part of our success will depend on our ability to successfully market existing products  to acquire transaction volume  and to develop and introduce new products and services in addition to or as enhancements of existing products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our transaction volume  develop and introduce new products and services in addition to  or as enhancements of  existing products and services or compete successfully in the future 
if we lose customers  our business operations may be materially adversely affected  which could cause us to cease our business or curtail our business to a point where we are no longer able to generate sufficient revenue to fund operations 
there is no assurance that our current products and services will stay competitive with those of our competitors or that we will be able to introduce new products and services to compete successfully in the future 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or others may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property 
third parties have asserted patent infringement claims against our check authorization products in the past and others may assert these types of claims against these products  or any of our other products  in the future 
patent infringement claims can require us to modify our products  services and technologies or obtain a license to permit our continued use of those rights 
we may not be able to do either of these things in a timely manner or upon reasonable terms and conditions 
failure to do so could seriously harm our business and operating results 
in addition  future litigation relating to infringement claims could result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of management resources 
adverse determinations in any litigation or proceeding could also subject us to significant liabilities and could prevent us from selling some of our products  services or technologies 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights  or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services 
the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and monitor and police our intellectual property rights and these efforts may not be uniformly successful 
our business is highly dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data center  and any disruption or material breach of security of our systems could harm our business 
our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data center 
any significant interruptions or security or privacy breaches in our facilities  computer networks and databases could harm our business and reputation  result in a loss of customers or cause inquiries and fines or penalties from regulatory or governmental authorities 
our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized entry or physical break ins  computer viruses and hackers 
the measures we have enacted  such as the implementation of security access and disaster recovery plans  may not be successful and we may experience problems other than system failures 
we may also experience software defects  development delays and installation difficulties  which would harm our business and reputation and expo se us to potential liability and increased operating expenses 
we may not be able to attract  retain or integrate key personnel  which may prevent us from successfully operating our business 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract other qualified personnel in the future 
our success will depend upon the continued service of key management personnel 
the loss of services of any of the key members of our management team or our failure to attract and retain other key personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect on employee productivity and morale and have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse e ffect on our business and stock price 
we are required to certify and report on our compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered chartered accounting firm addressing these assessments 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section in order to achieve effective internal controls we may need to enhance our accounting systems or processes which could increase our cost of doing business 
any failure to achieve and maintain an effe ctive internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business 
estimates of future financial results are inherently unreliable 
from time to time  the company and its representatives may make public predictions or forecasts regarding the company s future results  including estimates regarding future revenues  expense levels  tax rates  acquisition expenses  capital expenditures  earnings or earnings from operations 
any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions and judgments by management regarding the likelihood that certain possible future events will in fact occur 
these assumptions and judgments are subject to significant uncertainties and shifting market dynamics  and  as a matter of course  many of them will prove to be incorrect 
further  events that may seem unlikely or relatively certain at the time a given prediction is made may in fact occur or fail to occur 
man y of the factors that can influence the outcome of any prediction or projections are beyond our control 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
investors are cautioned that any prediction  projection or other forward looking statement made by us should be considered current only as of the date made 
investors are encouraged to utilize the entire available mix of historical and forward looking information made available by us  and other information relating to our company and our products and services  when evaluating our prospective results of operations 
legislation or regulation could impair our ability to collect and use data  increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business 
existing and new laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy protection could harm our ability to collect and use consumer data  increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business 
we collect personal data about consumers for use in our check authorization products 
due to increasing public concern over consumer privacy rights  congress and state legislatures have adopted and are considering adopting laws and regulations restricting the purchase  sale and sharing of personal information about consumers 
we are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulations will be adopted in the future 
a material increase in the scope of these types of restrictions could impair the efficacy of our check authorization products 
we have a general history of losses and may not operate profitably in the future 
we have incurred losses for the last five fiscal years 
our net losses and negative cash flow may continue for the foreseeable future 
as of march   our accumulated deficit was approximately  we believe that our planned growth and profitability will depend in large part on our ability to expand our client base 
accordingly  we intend to invest in marketing  development of our client base and development of our marketing technology and operating infrastructure 
if we are not successful in expanding our client base  it will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue to operate our business 
demand for many of our products and services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers  and accordingly  our revenues could be impacted negatively by a general economic slowdown or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees 
any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt  or a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage  could reduce the volume of transactions that we process  and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a long sales cycle for a significant number of our products and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the implementation of some of our products often involves significant capital commitments by our customers 
potential customers generally require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them as to the value of our products and services 
we incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer 
we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale 
our sales cycle may be extended due to our customers budgetary constraints or for other reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
failure to maintain existing contracts customers because a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could be materially adversely a ffected if we are unable to retain customers 
we have had in the past and may have in the future  a small number of customers that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
our revenue could materially decline because of a delay in signing agreements with a single customer or the failure to retain an existing customer 
consolidation in the industries we serve may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
mergers  acquisitions and personnel changes at retailers and electronic funds transfer networks may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the grocery store and supermarket industry continue s to consolidate  causing the number of grocery stores and supermarkets to decline 
this consolidation could cause us to lose current and potential customers  and market share if an entity resulting from a combination of our customers determines that it is more efficient to develop in house products and services similar to ours or to use our competitors products and services

item legal proceedings nbspon july  we filed suit in the us district court for the district of delaware against four companies who provide equipment  systems and services that convert paper checks presented at the point of sale into electronic transactions 
in the suit  we alleged that these four companies infringed certain of our us patents and sought damages and injunctive and other relief for the alleged willful infringement of these patents 
a federal judge had set a trial date of april  in this matter 
in september  one of the defendants filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief 
the defendant was seeking a declaratory judgment that each of the patents in suit was invalid  unenforceable  not infringed by the defendant and that the court determine that this was an extraordinary and exceptional case and award the defendant it s attorney s fees and litigation expenses 
nbspin july  telecheck international inc  an affiliate of one of the defendants in the delaware litigation  filed a complaint for patent infringement in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas marshall division against us in an action styled telecheck international inc as plaintiff vs 
lml payment systems inc 
and lml payment systems corp 
in the suit  telecheck international inc alleged that we infringed us patent nos 
 and  and sought damages  injunctive and other relief 
nbspin april  we settled our litigation with the defendants in the delaware case 
we granted licenses to the defendants in exchange for cash consideration that  in one case  involved a release fee of  for past transactions  a  standstill fee and an ongoing running royalty on future transactions with future royalty payments by this licensee being contingent upon the number of transactions conducted in the future 
in other cases  the cash consideration we received was for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents and was based on our receiving a lump sum payment for past and future transactions 
the lump sum payment was based upon our estimation of each defendant s past transactions and our estimation of the number of transactions each defendant would conduct over the remaining lifetime of our patents  less a discounted cash flow adjustment as a result of receiving all funds for estimated future transactions immediately 
the total amount received for fully paid up licenses was  nbspin april we also settled the litigation filed against us for patent infringement by telecheck international inc  an affiliate of one of the defendants in the delaware litigation 
as part of the settlement we granted a fully paid up license to certain of our patents and we received a fully paid up license to certain of the telecheck international inc patents and to certain other patents owned by first data corp 
nbspas part of our strategy to enforce our intellectual property rights with respect to our patent portfolio  we entered into a special fee arrangement with our legal counsel  kirkland and ellis  llp  who represented us both as plaintiffs in the delaware litigation and as defendants in the telecheck international inc litigation in texas 
under the terms of our special fee arrangement  we paid  to kirkland and ellis llp 
nbspprior to the fiscal year ended march   we were involved in a dispute with a former consultant relating to the payment of finders fees with respect to certain acquisitions made by us in the fiscal years ended march  and march  in october we initiated arbitration proceedings pursuant to the terms of the finder s fee agreement between us and the former consultant the finder s fee agreement 
in june  the former consultant filed a counter claim in the arbitration proceedings alleging we breached the finder s fee agreement 
in september  an arbitrator awarded the former consultant  in damages plus interest of  for an alleged breach by us in failing to issue additional shares of ours as part of the former consultant s finders fees with respect to certain acquisitions we made in the fiscal years ended march  and march  we were also responsible for reimbursing certain arbitration costs to the former consultant totaling  the damages  interest and arbitration cost reimbursement totaling  have been recorded and reported as other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and deficit for the fiscal year ended march  in october  we filed a motion to modify the award granted by the arbitrator to the former consultant and have the award reversed 
in november  this motion was denied by the arbitrator 
consequently  we made the required payment in complete satisfaction of the award 
nbspin march  a former employee of ours filed a complaint against us for breach of contract and wrongful termination in the superior court of the state of arizona in and for the county of maricopa 
in the suit  the former employee alleges that we wrongfully reduced the former employee s salary without requisite notice under an employment agreement between the former employee and us and wrongfully terminated the former employee without requisite notice and for acts that do not constitute cause under the aforementioned employment agreement 
we believe that these allegations are without merit and do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
nbspother than as described herein  we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings 
however  we are party from time to time to additional ordinary litigation incidental to our business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial position or liquidity

canadian federal tax considerations general there are no foreign or currency controls in canada  and there are no exchange restrictions on borrowing from abroad  on the repatriation of capital  or the ability to remit dividends  profits  interests  royalties  or other payments to non resident holders of our common stock 
however  any such remittance to a resident of the us is subject to a reduced withholding tax pursuant to various articles of the canada us income tax convention  the treaty between canada and the us dividends generally  dividends that are paid or credited by canadian corporations to nonresident shareholders are subject to a nonresident tax of 
however  the treaty provides that dividends paid by a canadian corporation to a corporation resident of the us with no permanent establishment in canada  which owns at least of our voting stock paying the dividend  are subject to the canadian nonresident withholding tax of 
in all other cases  when a dividend is paid by a canadian corporation to the beneficial owner resident in the us  the canadian nonresident withholding tax is of the amount of the dividend 
the reduced withholding tax rates do not apply if the beneficial owner of the shares carries on business through a permanent establishment in canada and the stock holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment 
in such a case  the dividends are taxable in canada as general business profits at rates that may exceed the or rates applicable to dividends that are not effectively connected with a canadian permanent establishment 
the treaty permits canada to apply its domestic law rules for differentiating dividends from interest and other disbursements

overview lml payment systems inc is a financial payment processor 
we provide check risk services such as electronic check authorization  electronic check processing services such as electronic check conversion and return check management such as traditional and electronic recovery services to retail clients 
we also provide mainframe payment processing software modules and rights to use our patented intellectual property to retailers and other payment processors 
when we provide return check management services  we typically receive revenue when we are successful at recovering the principal amount of the original transaction on behalf of the client 
in some instances we also earn a percentage of the principal amount and in some other instances our secondary recovery services provide for us to earn additional fees when legal action is required 
when we provide check authorization and electronic check conversion services we typically earn revenue based upon the number of transactions we process through our data center 
when we provide mainframe based payment software modules to clients who are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process financial transactions in house  or through their own data center  we typically earn revenue by way of a fixed software license fee 
in some instances we also earn revenue by way of royalties that are typically based upon a fixed sale price or on a usage or transaction basis 
when we provide licenses to our intellectual property estate which includes four us patents describing electronic check processing methods  we typically earn revenue from release fees for potential past infringement and ongoing royalty fees 
we provide our financial payment processing services from our office locations in scottsdale  arizona  wichita  kansas and dallas  texas 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a decrease over total revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue associated wit h our primary and secondary check collection business 
revenue from electronic check verification increased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in existing customers utilizing our enhanced electronic check verification services 
our enhanced electronic check verification services provide customers with acce ss to additional check databases for a higher per transaction fee 
revenue from our primary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the reduction in revenue from our primary check collections business was primarily attributable to us no longer providing check recovery services to eleven  formerly our largest customer which was responsible for approximatel y of revenue from our primary check collections business for the fiscal year revenue from our secondary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the decrease in revenue from our secondary check collections business was partially attributable to a decrease in collections of the principal amount and related fees of returned checks assigned for secondary recovery and partially attributable to a reduction in new returned check volume assigned for secondary recovery of approximately for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in light of these decreases in revenue from our primary and secondary check collections operations  we are presently evaluating our current business strategy in these areas of our business 
we are reviewing options such as adjusting and or re positioning some of our services in this market  which may include new marketing strategies including offerings of different financial payment processing products 
any new strategy may include acquiring complementary businesses  products or technologies  and or divesting certain operations in whole or in part or discontinuing providing certain financial payment processing products or services currently being offered

revenue from our licensing of certain payment software modules was approximately  for fiscal year  compared to approximately  for fiscal year revenue from royalties received from checkfree pertaining to their marketing of the pep reach tm product was approximately  for fiscal year  compared to approximately  for fiscal year we believe future royalties are dependent upon the continued successful marketing by checkfree corporation of the pep reach product 
according to the nilson report issue dated december  checks written at retailers have been decreasing as a percentage of overall payments primarily as a result of increases in credit and debit card transactions 
we expect this trend to continue  making it more expensive on a per item basis for retailers to process paper check items 
we also believe that as more consumer payments migrate to credit and debit cards  those consumers who continue to use checks may present a higher degree of risk to merchants and retailers thus making our check authorization services valuable to merchants and retailers 
we believe that retailers may be attracted to the cost savings that electronic check conversion processes can provide over paper check transactions 
we believe that the number of electronic check transactions will continue to increase and believe that such increases will provide continued revenue opportunities for us 
according to nacha  accounts receivable check conversion  referred to by many as arc  grew last year to over billion transactions 
we believe that the potential for the arc market is much larger than current processing levels 
our partnership with checkfree corporation and their marketing of the pep reach tm product to banks  financial institutions and other organizations who currently provide paper lockbox services to clients  represents an important growth opportunity for us 
revenue from licensing our patented intellectual property increased by approximately from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year we expect that revenue from licensing our intellectual property may fluctuate significantly from year to year and we cannot give any assurance as to the level of licensing revenue that will be realized in future periods 
we continue to actively seek to license our patent estate and have received various levels of interest from entities regarding licensing arrangements 
our goal is to negotiate long term arrangements based upon favourable financial terms while at the same time preparing to enforce the rights granted to us under our patent estate 
we now have six licensees of our patents and expect to license other businesses processing electronic check transactions at the point of sale and in other fields 
while we have not fully quantified the results of successfully licensing our patent estate  we expect that licensing arrangements would have a significant positive impact upon our future financial performance 
costs of operations costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  transaction processing personnel  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
costs of operations decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of a pproximately 
the decrease was primarily attributable to certain cost reductions such as transaction processing costs  transaction processing personnel and telecommunication costs associated with us no longer providing check authorization and recovery services to eleven  our former largest customer 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million in the second quarter  approximately million in the third quarter and approximately million in the fourth quarter 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional service fees  which include legal fees  audit fees  sec compliance costs and costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  stock based compensation expense  personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences  and public relations 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million from approximately million for the fiscal year and  respectively  an increase of approximately  or approximately 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees of approximately million from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase in legal fees is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with the patent infringement suit we filed during fiscal year of approximately million from approximately  for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year  and partially attributable to costs associated with the legal fees related to the arbitration proceedings between us and a former consultant and other legal fees associated with ordinary legal matters incidental to our business

we believe the net consideration of  in addition to further consideration we anticipate receiving from future running royalties pursuant to one of the settlement and license agreements should provide positive cash flows from our operating activities in fiscal see part i  item legal proceedings 
consequently  we believe that this consideration combined with our existing cash and cash equivalent balances should satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in fiscal in light of our strategic objective of acquiring electronic payment volume across all our financial payment processing services and strengthening our position as a financial payment processor  our long term plans may include the potential to strategically acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies and may also include instituting actions against other entities who we believe are infringing our intellectual property 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances and potential cash flows from operations should satisfy our long term cash requirements  however  we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through equity or debt financing  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contingencies in march  a former employee of a subsidiary of the corporation filed a complaint against us for breach of contract and wrongful termination in the superior court of the state of arizona in and for the county of maricopa 
in the suit  the former employee alleges that the subsidiary of the corporation wrongfully reduced the former employee s salary without requisite notice under the employment agreement between the former employee and us and wrongfully terminated the former employee without requisite notice and for acts that do not constitute cause under the aforementioned employment agreement 
we believe that these allegations are without merit and do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
contractual obligations in our prior fiscal year  we entered into a two year financing arrangement with de lage financial services canada inc for funding a software enhancement renewal fee 
in our prior fiscal year  we entered into a three year lease agreement with ibm credit corporation to finance an equipment purchase

we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the course of preparing these financial statements 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to the recognition of revenues  valuation of other long lived assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
these estimates form the basis of our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions we have used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period these services are performed 
these services consist of processing our clients electronic check authorization and conversion transactions 
these fees are charged on a per transactions basis and depend upon the contractual agreement with the client 
check recovery fees are recognized in the period when cash is received for the services performed 
these services typically consist of recovering the face amount of the original transaction and a service or collection fee 
we are typically paid the service fee only when we are successful in the recovery of the face amount of the original transaction on behalf of our client 
in cases where our clients are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process transactions on their own  we license certain elements of our modules of our electronic payment processing software 
we are typically paid either a fixed license fee that is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition or in some cases a fee per transaction processed by the client whereupon revenue is recognized at the time the transactions are processed  provided the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
license fees regarding the licensing of the technology embodied within our four us patents regarding electronic check processing are recognized in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition sab and further guidance provided by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica emerging issues committee eic abstract eic and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in some instances  our licensees have paid an up front fee to obtain a license  and in such cases the up front fee is treated as deferred revenue and is recognized over the life of the agreement 
in o ther cases  our licensees have paid a fee for a release regarding potential past infringements of our four us patents and  in such cases  the fee is recognized as revenue when the release is granted and the amount is reasonably determinable 
running royalties earned from electronic check transactions processed by the licensee are recognized on a monthly basis 
valuation of other long lived assets we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of our other long lived assets  primarily our patents and our transaction processing software  equipment and other intangible assets  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when there are indications that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we perform an impairment test in accordance with cica section and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the opinion of management  our long lived assets are appropriately valued as of march  and stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and directors under the terms of our stock option plan and our stock incentive plan 
canadian gaap previously provided two alternative methods of accounting for stock options under the terms and conditions we typically issue such options 
alternative one is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant and recognize that value as an expense to operations over the stock option s vesting period alternative one 
alternative two is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant but only reflect the impact in a pro forma disclosure setting forth compensation expense as if the fair value method was used in the corporation s financial statements and forego adjusting the consolidated statements of operations alternative two 
during the fiscal year  cica released revised transitional provisions for voluntary adoption of alternative one 
these provisions permit a prospective application of the alternative one recognition provisions to accounting for stock options not previously accounted for at fair value  provided we elect to apply the alternative one method to those stock options granted starting for our fiscal year we adopted these transitional provisions during our fiscal year and  therefore  stock options granted during the fiscal years  and have been recognized under alternative one and presented as stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock options granted in previous fiscal years have continued to be accounted for under the alternative two method with stock based compens ation expense reflected in a pro forma disclosure 
stock options granted in future fiscal years will be accounted for under the alternative one method with stock based compensation recognized as an expense to operations over the stock options vesting period 
we determine the assumptions used in computing the fair value of the stock options by estimating the expected useful lives  giving consideration to the vesting periods  contractual lives  actual employee forfeitures and the relationship between the exercise price and the historical market value of our common stock  among other factors 
the risk free interest rate is the federal government zero coupon bond rate for the relevant expected life 
the fair value of the stock options are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
future income taxes and valuation allowance future income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we assess the likelihood that our future tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for the past years and estimates of future profitability  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net future tax assets 
we will continue to monitor our es timate of future profitability and the likelihood of realizing our net future tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities which consist of money market and commercial paper 
at march   our marketable securities were recorded at a fair value of approximately million  with an overall weighted average return of and an overall weighted average life of less than three months 
our marketable securities have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of our overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
we are not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of our long term debt is at a fixed rate as of march  the fair value of our debt approximates its carrying value 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
we have immaterial exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
