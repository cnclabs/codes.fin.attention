we conduct business in the buffet segment of the restaurant industry and the operating performance of our restaurants is directly and heavily influenced by the overall state of the national and local economies where our restaurants are located 
when overall economic conditions negatively impact the financial performance of an individual restaurant  we periodically consider all the factors influencing that restaurant  such as operational efficiencies  local demographic changes  local construction activity  competition and other related factors 
we then assess the possibility of whether we can improve both the short term and long term financial results  at least to a level sufficient to recover our investment in the leasehold improvements and equipment assets 
there have been and likely will continue to be situations where we will make the decision that an asset is impaired and a write down is required

impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry 
critical accounting policies and judgments the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect the company s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets periodically  the company records or reduces the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based upon recent past financial performance  tax reporting positions  and expectations of future taxable income 
the company expects to continue to record a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until it sustains profitable operations 
property  buildings and equipment property and equipment and real property under capitalized leases are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings building improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or estimated economic life of the assets 
the life of the lease includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to renew options would result in a substantial economic penalty 
if a lease option was not exercised in the future  any remaining unamortized leasehold improvements would be required to be recognized immediately which could result in a significant charge adversely affecting the operating results of that period 
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
remodeling costs are generally capitalized 
the company s accounting policies regarding buildings and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense that would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company has ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of january  as a result  there is no charge for goodwill amortization expense contained in the company s statements of operations for the years ended january   january  and january  sfas required that goodwill initially be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit that included goodwill to the carrying amount of the reporting unit as of january  the company performed the transitional impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of relevant reporting units was in excess of the fair value of those units 
this resulted in a transitional impairment loss of  which was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of a tax benefit of  in the first quarter of subsequent to adoption of sfas  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or when a triggering event occurs that indicates a potential impairment may have occurred in accordance with sfas future impairments of goodwill  if any  will adversely affect the results of operations in the periods recognized 
impairment of long lived assets the company determines that an impairment write down is necessary for locations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets  which would adversely affect operating results in the affected period 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge and could adversely affect operating results in any period 
insurance programs the company is self insured for general liability claims 
the company has commercial insurance for casualty claims in excess of million per claim and million per year as a risk reduction strategy 
self insurance accruals include estimates based on historical information and expected future development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in actual liabilities materially different from the calculated accruals 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
generally  the staff position requires companies to expense rental costs incurred during a construction period 
we are required to adopt fsp in our fiscal year beginning january  the company does not believe the adoption of this staff position will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company is required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if the company had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although the company has not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  the company is evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expects the adoption to potentially have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share starting in fiscal in december  the fasb issued fasb  inventory cost  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
the company does not believe the adoption of fasb will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on its million revolving line of credit  of which remained outstanding as of january and april  the revolving line of credit interest rate is libor plus two percent per annum averaging approximately in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings  the amount of which would depend on the amount outstanding on the line of credit 
all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
typically the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing  menu mix or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower operating margins for our restaurant concepts
