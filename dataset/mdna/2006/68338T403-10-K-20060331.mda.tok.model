item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on our idle lease accrual 
item legal proceedings onvia is party to a consolidated securities class action suit filed in a final settlement agreement in this suit has been negotiated and was preliminarily approved by the united states district court for the southern district of new york in february  and we are awaiting final court approval 
if the final settlement is approved  onvia will be released from any future liability under this lawsuit  therefore  we have not made an accrual for a loss contingency related to this suit 
we have a million directors and officers liability policy that would cover any award up to million  subject to a  deductible 
onvia has incurred approximately  for attorneys fees in defense of this suit as of december  according to the terms of the settlement agreement  defense fees incurred after june  will be refunded if the final settlement is approved 
approximately  of the defense fees incurred to date were incurred after june  and will be refunded to onvia if the final settlement is approved 
in the event that the final settlement agreement is not approved and onvia is found liable for damages  which we believe is a remote possibility  the  in attorneys fees already incurred would be applied to our deductible and we would be liable for the balance of any additional fees and awards in excess of those already paid up to our  deductible  and any award in excess of our million liability policy 
the fairness hearing for final approval of the settlement is scheduled for april  in february  a lawsuit was filed against onvia in king county  washington by responsive management systems 
the complaint alleged that onvia had sent unsolicited facsimiles to recipients in violation of the federal telephone consumer protection act  washington s facsimile law  and the washington consumer protection act 
the complaint sought injunctive relief as well as incidental statutory damages allowed under the federal and washington facsimile laws on behalf of the plaintiff and each member of the proposed class who received a facsimile in we send facsimiles to clients with whom we have an existing business relationship  or to vendors with whom our agency partners have an existing relationship 
we believe that we have strong defenses and are defending against this lawsuit aggressively 
in october  the court granted onvia s motion for partial summary judgment  eliminating plaintiff s claim for injunctive relief and thereby making it more difficult for plaintiffs to certify a class action status 
on february   the plaintiff filed a motion for class action certification 
the hearing on the motion for class certification will be held on may  from time to time we are subject to various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although we cannot predict the outcomes of these proceedings with certainty  management does not believe that the disposition of any known matters  or of the matters specifically discussed above  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

management overview in  onvia s board of directors approved a strategic plan to invest up to million to develop and launch new business intelligence products 
during onvia executed the first stage of this strategic plan  which called for the launch of new information products  the recruitment of strong sales and marketing management  and refinement of our sales methodology to a more consultative sales approach 
as planned  we launched onvia business builder in july  and hired new sales and marketing senior management who developed the go to market strategy for the new product offering and implemented a new sales methodology 
the new sales approach is intended to decrease our reliance on direct marketing and improve the way potential prospects are targeted and qualified to increase the acquisition and retention of high value clients 
as a result of this change  we discontinued our low value county level product and began migrating our county clients into higher valued offerings 
we expect this new targeted sales approach to reduce the number of low value clients  while increasing annual contract value 
at december   low value clients represented approximately of our total client base  but only of our revenue 
in order to provide a means to evaluate our business in a method consistent with other businesses in the information industry we will now provide the following operating metrics number of clients  annual contract value  annual contract value per client  and quarterly contract value per client as defined below number of clients number of clients represents the number of individual businesses subscribing to our products and replaces our legacy metric of clients and enterprise licensees 
the number of clients metric excludes enterprise licensees  because  at this time  number of seat licenses alone is not a reliable measure of value 
at december  we had approximately  clients  down from approximately  at december  this decline in the number of clients is primarily the result of the discontinuation of our low value products as discussed above 
annual contract value annual contract value acv is the aggregate annual subscription value of our entire client base 
growth in annual contract value demonstrates our success in increasing the number of high value clients and upgrading existing clients into new and higher valued products 
at december   annual contract value was million  up compared to million at december  
table of contents annual contract value per client annual contract value per client acvc is the annual contract value divided by the number of clients and indicates the average value of each of our subscriptions 
at december   acvc was  compared to at december   an increase of 
quarterly contract value per client quarterly contract value per client qcvc represents the average annual contract value of all new and renewing clients transacting during the quarter and is a leading indicator of future annual contract value per client 
in the fourth quarter of  qcvc was  an increase of compared to in the third quarter of  and an increase of compared to in the fourth quarter of in  we increased revenue to million  compared to million in cost of revenue increased to million  compared to million in the increase in cost of revenue is the result of an increase in headcount in our research department  and in third party content to supplement new product introductions 
operating expenses increased to million  compared to million in  and net loss increased to million  compared to million in with the exception of the additional idle lease accrual discussed below under lease obligations  the increase in cost of revenue  operating expenses and net loss was planned and is primarily related to the million investment discussed above 
revenue increased as a result of an increase in our acvc 
we believe this increase in acvc was driven primarily by the early adoption of onvia business builder  which has a higher price point than our onvia guide product 
in the fourth quarter of  of our sales included onvia business builder  which resulted in a increase in qcvc as discussed above 
recent developments on february   we executed a non binding letter of intent to sublease approximately  square feet of idle space in our current corporate headquarters 
the potential subtenant subsequently requested a longer lease term than we have remaining on our existing master lease  therefore  the sublease negotiations have extended and now include our landlord 
management believes that the addition of a third party in the negotiations has added additional risk to the likelihood of executing a sublease 
we believe that if we are unsuccessful in executing this sublease that it will take us longer than previously estimated to sublease our idle space 
while it is still possible that a sublease will be executed  at this time management does not feel that it is probable that negotiations will result in a sublease 
therefore  we recorded an additional accrual of approximately  in the fourth quarter of to recognize the additional time it may take to find a sublessee  partially offset by an improvement in current market rates due to the strengthening of the real estate market in seattle 
if a sublease is successfully executed  management will reevaluate the reasonableness of the idle lease accrual and we may be required to reverse some portion of the adjustment made in the fourth quarter of application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our 
table of contents assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition subscription revenues are generally prepaid at the beginning of the subscription term and we offer annual  quarterly and monthly payment options 
we also offer  on a limited basis  extended multi year contracts to our clients 
the subscription fee is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions from our non enterprise clients whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date  as well as the invoiced portion of enterprise contracts whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
content licenses are generally multi year arrangements that are invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis 
revenue from content licenses is recognized over the term of the agreement 
unbilled content licenses are not included in unearned revenue 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  accounting for costs of computer software developed for or obtained for internal use 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on the nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
noncash stock based compensation we record noncash stock compensation in connection with the grant or absorption in a purchase business combination of certain stock options and other equity instruments 
we have elected to account for our employee and director stock based awards under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  for employee and director options  unearned stock compensation is recorded as the excess  if any  between the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the options 
these amounts are amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the option  typically four years 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for stock based awards to those other than employees and directors 
in december the financial accounting standards board fasb released sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas r beginning january  upon adoption of this statement  we will begin recognizing the calculated fair value of new option grants  as well as the value of existing grants that vest subsequent to adoption  through operations 
we expect as a result of adoption of this statement that we will incur approximately million of non cash stock compensation expense in based on awards currently outstanding and planned future awards 
the total expense in and beyond will depend on several variables  including the number of share based awards granted  the fair value of those awards  the number of awards forfeited  and the vesting period of those awards 
in calculating the fair value of share based awards  management must make estimates about certain variables  including the expected term of the awards  volatility of the underlying security  and interest rates  among others  therefore the actual expense may be different from this estimate 
lease obligations as a result of the closure of our business to business exchange in  we have recorded charges to accrue rental payments on our idle office space leases through the remainder of the lease obligations in march we 
table of contents currently have approximately  square feet of idle office space in our current corporate headquarters building in seattle  washington  and approximately  square feet in our former corporate headquarters in seattle  washington 
the  square feet in our former corporate headquarters is currently under sublease by a third party through the remainder of our lease obligation in august the lease on our current corporate headquarters runs through march at december   the total accrual related to idle lease costs was approximately million 
total idle lease charges during the years ended december   and were million   and million  respectively 
our total obligation for office space under lease  inclusive of the lease payments included in our million accrual  is approximately million 
management is continually evaluating the reasonableness of our accrual based on current market conditions and other information available at the time of our analysis  and we make adjustments to our accrual when circumstances suggest that our previous estimates may require adjustment 
accordingly  during  management made updates to our idle lease accrual based on market information available at the time 
in the second quarter of  we increased our accrual by  and in the fourth quarter of we increased our accrual by an additional  in the second quarter management extended the estimated time in which we felt we could sublease the idle space based upon activity up to that time 
in addition  management changed the estimated sublease rates based on current market rates 
based on information available at the time of the second quarter adjustment  management believed that we would have the idle space sublet by the end of we have been encouraged by the number of tours since that time  however  these tours have not progressed to the sublease negotiation phase at the rate anticipated 
based on market information currently available  management does not believe that it is probable that we will have this space sublet by the end of as previously estimated 
as a result  we have extended the estimated timeline for subleasing this idle space from the end of to periodic dates beginning in the first quarter of through the second quarter of  and we have revised the estimated market rates based on current market information  resulting in an additional accrual of  we anticipate that our accrual will cover our remaining contractual obligations  assuming that we will have the idle space sublet by the second quarter of at estimated current market rates  which are below our contractually obligated rates  through the remainder of the lease obligations 
should it take longer to sublease the excess office space or should the sublease amounts be lower than our estimates  the actual cost could exceed the amount currently accrued and we may be required to make an additional accrual 
please refer to the discussion under recent developments above for additional information related to our idle lease accrual 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced portion of our enterprise contracts and content licenses once we have a signed agreement and an invoice has been created 
we do not record a receivable for the unbilled portion of our enterprise contracts or content licenses 
as of december  and  the unbilled portion of enterprise contracts and content licenses was approximately million and  respectively 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses

revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily driven by an increase in acvc  which is attributable to adoption of our onvia business builder product and upgrading clients 
table of contents from low value county products to our higher value products 
if adoption of onvia business builder and other anticipated new products is consistent with our expectations  we expect to continue to see improvement in our acvc as well as an increase in client retention rates in future periods 
costs of revenues increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  our costs of revenues consist primarily of payroll related expenses associated with collecting  categorizing and publishing of our content  and also include third party content fees and credit card processing fees 
third party content and credit card processing fees were approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
costs of revenues increased in total and as a percentage of revenue due in part to an increase of  in payroll related expenses as a result of headcount growth in our research team and normal merit increases

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in total and as a percentage of revenue is attributable in part to an increase in headcount and commissions in our sales and marketing teams  which resulted in an increase of  in payroll expenses in weighted average headcount in our sales and marketing teams was in  compared to in we also experienced increases of  in marketing related expenses attributable to the launch of onvia business builder in the third quarter of   in consulting expenses related to the development of a new consultative sales methodology  and an increase of  in travel related expenses due to growth in and increased travel by the sales teams 
these increases were offset by a decrease of  in allocated expenses 
allocated expenses include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and facilities related costs  and these costs are allocated across departments based on headcount 
although headcount increased compared to the prior year in our sales and marketing teams  it decreased as a percentage of total headcount due to higher growth in our research and technology teams  resulting in a smaller allocation of these expenses 
technology and development 
technology and development expenses were million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or

research headcount is included in technology and development for purposes of allocating these expenses 
we also experienced an increase of  in facilities expenses primarily due to the relocation of our research department to a previously idle floor in our corporate headquarters building  and an increase of  in software license fees due to new product requirements and growth in our overall headcount 
these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by the capitalization of  in payroll related costs for the internal development of software

table of contents the increase in revenue over the prior year  professional services increased  due primarily to an increase in legal fees incurred in defense of the faxing lawsuit  and training and strategic planning expenses increased  as a result of a new management training program and expenses associated with our new product launch 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in recruiting expenses and a decrease of  in insurance expenses 
recruiting fees were higher in because of searches to fill vacancies on our board of directors and retainer fees paid for other senior management positions 
the board of directors vacancies were filled in and we did not incur these expenses in and a majority of the retainer fees for senior management searches were paid in the decrease in insurance expenses is due to a reduction in our directors and officers d o insurance premiums

our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million  primarily due to increased spending pursuant to our strategic plan to invest in the development of new products and recruitment of senior management 
we also used approximately million on net payments for our idle office space leases 
we expect to see a decrease in cash used for our idle leased office space beginning in the first quarter of  and we estimate that we will have our remaining idle space sublet by the end of the second quarter of  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
should it take longer to sublease the idle office space  or should the sublease rates be lower than our estimates  the reduction in our cash used for idle lease payments may be delayed or reduced

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity prices  however  we consider our exposure to these risks to be insignificant 
interest rate risk we have assessed our susceptibility to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments 
we manage our interest rate risk by purchasing investment grade securities and diversifying our investment portfolio among issuers and maturities 
due to the fact that we carry no debt at december  and due to our investment policies and the short term nature of our investments  we believe that our risk associated with interest rate fluctuations is negligible 
our investment portfolio may consist of a combination of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities  auction rate securities and corporate debt securities with remaining maturities of thirteen months or less except auction rate securities 
auction rate securities generally have long term stated maturities  however  these investments have characteristics similar to short term investments  because at pre determined intervals  generally between to days of the purchase  there is a new auction process 
our primary investment objectives are preservation of principal  a high degree of liquidity and a maximum total return consistent with the investment objectives 
we invest primarily in us denominated only commercial paper issued by us corporations  direct obligations of the us government  municipal securities  auction rate securities issued by us financial institutions  bankers acceptances and or certificates of deposit  and money market funds fully invested in direct obligations of the us government 
us government and agency securities and money market funds investing in them are exempt from size limitations  all other securities are limited to of the portfolio at the time of purchase  per issuer 
in addition  the cumulative investments in an individual corporation  financial institution or financial institution s security are limited to million 
as of december   we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
foreign currency risk our foreign currency risk exposure is insignificant  because all of our sales are currently denominated in us currency 
a portion of our net operating losses nols are denominated in canadian dollars 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset associated with theses nols  because realization of the future tax benefit is not currently likely  therefore  we believe our foreign currency risk exposure associated with these nols is insignificant 
equity price risk we do not own any significant equity instruments and we do not currently have plans to raise additional capital in the equity markets  therefore  our equity price risk is insignificant
