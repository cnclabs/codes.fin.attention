item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation organized by daniel r 
baty and two other founders in in november  we completed our initial public offering 
from through  we expanded rapidly through acquisition and internal development and by december   operated assisted living communities with  units 
we believe  however  that during this expansion  the assisted living industry became over built  creating an environment characterized by sluggish or falling occupancy and market resistance to rate increases 
as a result  in we began an increased focus first on raising our occupancy and later on rate development  operating efficiencies  and cost controls 
this focus has continued throughout and we believe the assisted living industry has been improving over the past couple of years and opportunities to improve occupancy and rates  as well as gain greater access to capital are occurring 
the assisted living industry is experiencing increased regulation varying by state  increased insurance costs  and limited availability of capital for smaller local and regional operators 
in this type of environment  we believe that we will continue to witness consolidation of smaller local and regional operators into the larger national operators 
because of these circumstances  we have been able to complete several acquisitions or leases in the last two years 
in addition  our size and ability to respond to negative environmental conditions such as insurance availability and costs has attracted capital resources to allow us to convert communities we managed to communities we now lease 
in and  we operated approximately communities  but in we increased that to  in to and now in we have grown to communities 
from the end of to the end of  the communities we manage decreased from to and in decreased further to communities 
those communities we owned and leased increased from in to in and to in  reflecting both our increasing confidence in the assisted living industry and the availability of capital 
in we expect to continue focusing on increasing occupancy and adjusting rates as necessary  as well as reviewing acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria 
the following table sets forth a summary of our property interests 
as of december  as of december  as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units owned leased consolidated portfolio managed admin services joint venture partnership operated portfolio percentage increase owned communities increased in december due to the acquisition of three communities in arkansas 
of the leased communities at december   are accounted for as operating leases  in which the assets and liabilities of the communities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for as capital leases  in which a long term asset and corresponding liability is established on our balance sheet 
the remaining leased communities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as owned communities because of accounting requirements related to sale leaseback accounting  notwithstanding the legal sale of the communities and their subsequent leasing by us 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents one managed building was shut down and sold march   we discontinued management of one facility on october   and one on july the percentage increase indicates the change from the prior year 
two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or familial resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit  computed by dividing the total revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally rely on an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio  which includes the communities we own and lease  and our operating portfolio  which also includes the communities we manage 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average monthly revenue per unit increased from  in to  in and to  in the change from to represents an increase of  or and from to  an increase of  or 
this level of increase is partially due to repositioning several groups of our acquired communities over the past year to be more rate competitive and to establish a new presence in their respective markets 
in addition  increased competition in certain locations has prevented us from raising rates to the extent we otherwise would have desired 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average occupancy rate was in  increasing to and in and  respectively 
we believe that this increase in occupancy rates reflects industry wide factors  such as the declining supply of vacant units as well as our own actions and policies 
we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community  as witnessed by the increase in occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit from through since our inception in  we have incurred operating losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
significant transactions in and continuing in  we substantially increased the number of communities we lease  reduced the number of communities we manage  and  in connection with these changes  increased and restructured portions of our long term financing obligations 
the transactions associated with these developments are summarized below 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents emeritrust transactions beginning in  we managed communities under arrangements with a related investor group emeritrust that involved i payment of management fees to us ii options for us to purchase the communities at a price determined by a formula  and iii obligations to fund operating losses of certain communities 
emeritrust i communities management 
during the period from to  the arrangements were modified several times  the options to purchase and funding obligation were terminated  and the number of communities covered declined from to effective january   the management fee arrangement provided for a flat fee of of gross revenues 
the term currently expires march   subject to termination by either party on days notice 
on september   communities were leased pursuant to leases discussed below and five communities  which are now owned by mr 
baty  continued to be managed by us through december  one of these communities was sold to an independent third party effective january   which we continue to manage until they receive licensure and another community was closed january  we received management fees of approximately  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
emeritrust i communities lease on september   we completed the first phase of a transaction to lease baty reit lease up to assisted living communities in states  with  units 
these communities  which were owned by entities in which mr 
baty had financial interests  were acquired by an independent reit for an investment of approximately million and are being leased to us 
we completed the lease on the first communities on september   consisting of communities we had been managing and one existing lease 
one additional community was leased on march   and another one on september  of the communities included in this lease  were part of the communities referred to above and in past filings with the sec as the emeritrust i communities 
the initial leased communities are accounted for as capital leases 
the two additional communities are accounted for as operating leases with escalating rent payments  which are accounted for on a straight line basis 
the lease of these communities has a term of years  with one year renewal option 
the annualized cash lease payment for the communities is approximately million per year  with inflators to the extent the change in the consumer price index exceeds  not to exceed basis points during years two through four and basis points thereafter  as calculated with respect to the reit s investment basis in the properties 
all of the leases are triple net leases 
the initial leases have cross default provisions and are cross collateralized with all of our other leases and loans relating to other communities owned by the reit 
all of the leases contain certain financial and other covenants 
we have the right of first refusal to purchase these leased communities and mr 
baty is personally guaranteeing our obligations under the lease 
mr 
baty will receive  based on a prescribed formula  of the positive cash flow of the communities and will be responsible for of any negative cash flow  as defined in the cash flow sharing agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  the first quarter under this arrangement  mr 
baty earned  and earned  for the year ended december  emeritrust ii communities management 
through september   we managed the emeritrust ii communities  which included of the emeritrust communities  under management agreements providing for a base management fee of of gross revenue generated by the communities and an additional management fee of  payable if we met certain cash flow standards 
the management agreement for five of the communities also required us to fund cash operating losses of those communities 
under this arrangement  we received management fees of approximately million for the year ended december  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents emeritrust ii communities lease 
on september   an independent reit acquired the emeritrust ii communities for a cash purchase price of million and leased them to us 
a master lease covers the emeritrust ii communities and four other communities originally leased under a capital lease arrangement from the reit in march the lease is accounted for as a capital lease and resulted in additions to property and equipment and capital lease and financing obligations totaling approximately million related to the emeritrust communities 
the lease is for an initial year period  with one year renewal  and grants us a right of first opportunity to purchase any of the emeritrust ii communities if the reit decides to sell 
the lease is a triple net lease  with initial annual base rent of million of which million is attributable to the emeritrust ii communities  and periodic escalators of the lesser of three times the change in the consumer price index or basis points as calculated with respect to the reit s investment basis in the properties 
the reit also provided million of debt financing secured by our leasehold interests in the emeritrust ii communities 
this debt was consolidated with other debt held by the reit 
as part of the transaction  we also agreed to issue to the emeritrust ii investors warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrants expire september   and have an exercise price of subject to certain adjustments 
the holders have limited registration rights 
we included the fair value of these warrants  totaling approximately million  as lease acquisition costs that we amortize over the life of the lease 
as of february    of the warrants were exercised for proceeds of approximately million 
on march   we issued  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares 
the shares were purchased by the holder of the warrants pursuant to a net exercise provision of the warrants in which  shares subject to the warrants were used to pay the exercise price of  the shares used to pay the exercise price were valued at per share under the terms of the warrants 
repurchase of series a preferred stock in a two part transaction that was completed august   we repurchased all the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series a preferred stock had been issued originally in october for million 
as a part of the repurchase  the holder of the series a preferred stock waived approximately million in accrued and unpaid dividends 
as a result of the transaction  we recognized a gain of approximately million 
just prior to the repurchase  the series a preferred stock was accruing compounded  cumulative dividends of approximately million annually  with mandatory redemption in october at a price of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
in completing the repurchase  we avoided these future obligations 
we obtained the funds to complete the repurchase through three related transactions 
the first transaction involved three communities that we leased 
prior to this transaction  we also held notes receivable in the aggregate amount of million that were secured by the same three communities and under which we received interest of approximately  annually 
in the transaction  the communities were transferred to a reit  which became the new owner and lessor  and we received net proceeds of million in repayment of the notes we held and in exchange for our related security and other property interests in the communities 
the transfer of the communities was subject to our leases  the terms of which did not change 
because we disposed of our notes  we will no longer receive the interest we formerly did 
we recognized a deferred gain of approximately million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the leases 
the second transaction  with the same reit  involved the sale leaseback of four communities  three of which we owned and one of which we held through a joint venture interest  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the lease is for a year term with a year extension  is a triple net lease requiring us to pay management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents all expenses associated with the communities  and provides for an initial base annual rent of approximately million  with periodic escalators of the lesser of three times the change in the consumer price index or basis points as calculated with respect to the reit s investment basis in the properties 
as part of the transaction  the joint venture partner was bought out 
prior to this transaction  the communities secured mortgage financing of million  with annual interest payments of approximately million  which was assumed by the reit in the sale 
as a part of the assumption  we provided a letter of credit against the default of the underlying debt and continued a security interest in community receivables and limited guarantees in favor of the debt holder 
these features of the transaction constitute continuing involvement for accounting purposes  preclude sale leaseback accounting  and require us to use finance accounting 
as a result  although the transaction resulted in the legal sale of the communities to the reit and their subsequent leasing by us  our consolidated financial statements continue to reflect the communities as owned and we have established a financing obligation equal to the purchase price of approximately million 
the third transaction  again with the same reit  was a mortgage loan for million secured by our leasehold interest in the seven communities involved in the first two transactions 
the debt matures in august and required monthly interest only payments at an initial rate of per annum  with periodic increases 
this mortgage debt was subsequently consolidated with other debt held by the reit and was restructured in march lease of eight communities in may in may  we entered into an operating lease with a reit covering eight assisted living communities in four states containing an aggregate of units 
the lease is for an initial year period with three year extensions and includes an option to acquire the communities during the second year for a price of million and during the third year at the same price plus a premium 
we believe this option exercise price is currently well above fair value based on current operations 
under the lease we have a right of first opportunity to purchase any of the properties if the owner decides to sell 
the lease is a triple net operating lease  with annual base rental of million  and rent adjustments at the end of the first and second lease years based on a percentage of any increase in operating revenues  with an aggregate annual limit of  and adjustments each year thereafter based on increases in the consumer price index 
the reit has agreed to fund up to  for capital expenditures  with amounts added to the lease base and option price  and has provided us a year working capital loan for  with interest at per annum payable monthly 
lease of eight communities from baty on september   we entered into an agreement to lease the eight horizon bay communities 
in april  we had originally entered into agreements to acquire the ownership interest of one community and the leasehold interest of seven communities through the assumption of their respective mortgage debt and lease obligations 
the eight communities are comprised of units in louisiana and texas 
in may  we assigned our rights under these agreements to entities wholly owned by mr 
baty and entered into five year management agreements with the baty entities expiring april   and providing for a management fee of of gross revenue 
under the september   agreement  the baty entities assigned  and we assumed  the existing leases relating to seven of the facilities  which were leased from two different lessors 
in lieu of acquiring the remaining community  which was owned by a baty entity subject to mortgage financing  we leased the community for a term of years  with rent equal to the debt service on the mortgage indebtedness including interest and principal plus of cash flow after accounting for assumed management fees and capital expenditures 
in april  this single community was sold to a reit as part of the cpm jea transaction and became a capital lease as described below 
annual rent relating to the communities is estimated at million  with annual adjustments based upon changes in the consumer price index 
although this transaction closed december   the economic and financial management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents terms were effective june  four of these facilities are capital leases resulting in additions to property and equipment and capital lease and financing obligations on our consolidated balance sheets totaling approximately million debt consolidation in march  we completed a debt restructuring transaction with healthcare realty trust incorporated hrt that reduced the effective interest rate by approximately on million of debt  extended the maturity to march  and improved annual cash flows and earnings by approximately million and  respectively  exclusive of transaction charges  as further described below 
the reit that financed the emeritrust ii transaction already held million of our leasehold mortgage debt that matured in march and bore interest at per annum  commencing march with periodic increases up to per annum 
this reit also provided million in leasehold mortgage financing incurred to support the series a preferred stock repurchase in august on september   these two debt obligations  together with the million leasehold mortgage loan related to the emeritrust ii communities  were consolidated into a single million leasehold mortgage loan covering the communities and maturing on june  the reit loan 
the reit loan bore interest at an initial rate of per annum with periodic increases up to 
the consolidated reit loan required monthly payments of interest the first year and monthly payments of principal and interest  based on a year amortization  thereafter 
we elected to make a principal reduction of million in august the balance on the reit loan prior to the restructuring was approximately million 
on march   the reit loan was sold to hrt and modified 
the loan  as modified  provides for monthly interest only payments at per annum and matures march  the hrt loan 
the hrt loan may not be prepaid without the lender s consent 
in connection with the hrt loan modification  hrt also loaned an additional million to us on the same terms as the hrt loan to pay off certain transaction cost advances related to communities acquired in april the transaction cost advances were scheduled to mature in march and had an interest rate of  which would have increased to in april in addition  in connection with the hrt loan modification  we incurred approximately  in closing costs  which were included in the loan and resulted in a million hrt loan

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to resident programs and incentives such as move in fees  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  contingencies  self insured retention  health insurance  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are most significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company domiciled in the us for commercial general and professional liability insurance 
the insurance policy issued by the captive is claims made and insures liabilities associated with general and professional liability 
the policy insures on a per occurrence and aggregate limit basis in excess of a self insured retention 
we accrue losses based upon actuarial estimates of the total aggregate liability for claims occurring within the year  plus captive related expenses 
losses  whether within the self insured retention  the policy limits  or exceeding policy limits  are covered through a self insurance pool agreement  which includes our managed communities on a per unit of capacity basis 
should losses exceed actuarial estimates  additional expense may be accrued at the time of determination 
the captive was capitalized and the premium structure established pursuant to regulatory requirements 
we pay premiums based in part on a fixed schedule and in part as losses are actually paid 
the captive is subject to regulatory agency oversight and is reviewed for compliance with applicable law 
results from these reviews may change the timing or amount of subsequent funding 
during  we acquired commercial general liability insurance separate from the captive 
for health insurance  we self insure each covered member up to a certain level above which for certain covered members a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs 
health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
if these estimates are insufficient  additional charges may be required 
workers compensation insurance coverage applies for specific insurable states excluding texas  new york for a part of  and the compulsory state funds of washington  ohio  and west virginia through a high deductible  collateralized insurance policy 
the policy premium is based upon standard rates applied to estimated annual payroll 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to administer the claims  and claim expenses are paid from the collateral account 
the sum of the premium and related costs  estimated administration costs  and actuarial based estimated losses is accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll 
the posted collateral is carried as an asset on the balance sheet and is reduced as claims are paid from the account by the administrator 
at policy expiration each year  an insurer audit is conducted to adjust premiums based on actual  rather than estimated  annual payroll 
the insurer also audits the total incurred claim amount at least annually and may adjust the applicable policy year collateral requirement 
if there is a reasonable expectation that the total incurred losses will be less than the posted collateral  then the benefit of any over collateralization will inure to the company 
for part of  we insured occupational injuries and illness in new york through participation in a self insured group pool on a guaranteed cost insurance policy basis  with the premium payable monthly 
the insurer group contracts with an independent third party administrator on behalf of its members to manage the claims  and claim expenses are paid by the insurer 
during  new york was added to our collateralized insurance policy discussed above 
for work related injuries in texas  we provide work related injury benefits through a qualified non subscriber employee retirement income security act occupational injury and illness benefit plan 
claim expenses are paid as incurred and estimated losses are accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll 
an insurance policy is in place to cover liability losses in excess of a deductible amount 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to manage the claims 
the cost of this insurance is accrued monthly 
we also contract with an independent third party to certify the actuarial estimate of ultimate losses for workers compensation 

table of contents we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield  and weighted average option life 
to the extent such things as actual volatility or life of the options is different from estimated  amounts expensed will be more or less than would have been recorded otherwise 
we implemented sfas no 
r january  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our residents to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our residents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized which at this time shows a net asset valuation of zero 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
however  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
primarily due to the gain on sale of our investment in alterra  we have utilized all our available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards in we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
an impairment review is performed quarterly or whenever a change in condition occurs  which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual communities 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
we account for leases as either operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
the determination of the classification of leases is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
leases are generally accounted for as operating leases to the extent the underlying lease does not i transfer ownership by the end of the lease term  ii contain a bargain purchase option  iii include a lease term equal to or greater than of the economic life of the leased property  or iv include minimum lease payments for which the present value equals or exceeds of the fair value of the underlying leased property 
those leases that meet one of the criteria described above cannot be 

table of contents accounted for as operating leases but are accounted for as capital leases 
for properties under capital lease arrangements  a liability is established on the balance sheet based on the present value of the rent payments not to exceed the fair value of the underlying leased property  including base rent  fixed annual increases and any other payment obligations over the lease term  and a corresponding long term asset is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the lease obligation and the capital lease asset is depreciated over the term of the lease 
typically  capital lease treatment results in greater depreciation and interest than actual lease payments paid in the early years of the leases and less depreciation and interest than actual rent paid in the later years of the leases 
properties that are sold and leased back and for which we have continuing involvement are accounted for as financings  in which the property remains on the balance sheet and a financing obligation is recorded generally equal to the purchase price of the properties sold 
the impact on the statement of operations is similar to a capital lease 
properties under operating leases are not included on the balance sheet and are accounted for in the statement of operations as facility lease expense for actual rent paid to the extent any increases in rent is considered to be contingent and not determinable 
in cases where there are rent escalator provisions that have fixed or determinable increases  the operating leases are accounted for as the total rent for the term of the lease  including both base rent and fixed annual increases  on a straight line basis over the lease term 
this accounting treatment results in greater facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the earlier years of the respective leases and less facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the later years of the lease 
our accounting policy regarding contingent liabilities is to recognize those obligations if they are probable and estimable in accordance with sfas accounting for contingencies based on management s best estimate of the ultimate outcome 
if a legal judgment is rendered against us  then we believe that we have a probable liability and we accrue the full amount

table of contents except for any possible settlement on the texas jury verdict  for which we accrued approximately million in and paid a deposit to the court of million in  and debt maturities of million scheduled to be due in as discussed above  while our occupancy and revenue per unit grew from the comparable prior year period  they grew more slowly than our targeted growth 
while there is some indication that this is characteristic of the assisted living industry  we are responding through increased marketing initiatives  programs that address resident mix  increased maintenance and capital expenditures and other community level expenses to attract additional long term residents 
we believe that these initiatives will have a positive impact on operating performance over time 
additionally due to the adverse judgment against us as discussed above and described under legal proceedings an additional reserve was recorded at december   for million in accordance with our self insured pool agreement as discussed under summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates 
we believed there were substantial grounds for an appeal and that the damage award was not justified by the facts or the law in the case presented 
we appealed the verdict and in march posted funds in the amount of million in order to stay the proceedings while the appellate process runs its course  which could be anywhere from months to three years from the date of the verdict 
we are not required to pay additional amounts until the appeal and further litigation is completed or the case is resolved 
at this time  we can not predict when the case will be resolved 
during  we sold our investment in alterra for approximately million in cash  which had a significant positive effect on our cash position and our working capital deficit and provides funds to meet our payment obligations while we work to improve operating performance 
for most of  we had million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures that matured january  of the full principal amount  million was paid at maturity in january the remaining million principal amount of debentures were replaced with new convertible subordinated debentures that are due july   pursuant to an exchange offer completed by us in november see note convertible debentures of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in   and  we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  the cash flows have not always been sufficient to pay all our long term obligations and we have been dependent upon third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations 
we cannot guarantee that  if necessary in the future  such transactions will be available timely or at all  or on terms attractive to us 
in  and continuing through  we refinanced substantially all of our debt obligations  extending the maturities of such financings to dates in or thereafter  at which time we will need to refinance or otherwise repay the obligations 
as a consequence of our property and lease transactions in  our long term debt has increased from million at december   to million at december  our obligations under operating leases have increased from million to million  and our capital lease and financing obligations have decreased from million to million 
in particular  the number of communities we lease increased from at december   to at december  we believe that  on the basis of the operating results of these communities many of which we managed prior to the commencement of the leases  the cash flow from such communities will be adequate to support the increased lease obligations 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor 
such cross default provisions affect the majority of our properties 
accordingly  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted 
defaults can include certain financial covenants  which generally relate to lease coverage and cash flow 
in addition  we are required to maintain the leased properties in a reasonable and prudent manner 
for the year ended december   we were in violation of one or more covenants in certain of our leases  but management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents obtained waivers from the owners such that we were still deemed to be in compliance and thus  were not in default 
the waivers expire on january  management believes that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow or have adequate cash reserves for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through at least the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   exclusive of the refinancing discussed above in thousands principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  including current portion capital lease and financing obligations including current portion operating leases convertible debentures the following table summarizes interest on our contractual obligations at december   in thousands interest due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease and financing obligations convertible debentures recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement requires us to recognize expense for compensation cost related to share based payments  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans  in our consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r would eliminate our ability to account for share based awards to employees using accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and would require that the transactions use a fair value method as of the grant date 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for transactions in which we receive employee services in exchange for equity instruments or liabilities that are based on the fair value of our equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
under the new rule  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning january  we have determined that we will adopt the modified prospective method in implementing sfas no 
r 
using this method and the current assumptions used in the pro forma disclosure  we expect the stock compensation expense amounts to be similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
this interpretation clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event and if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of the liability should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
in the event the liability s fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  then the entity must disclose a a description of the obligation  b the fact that a liability has not been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  and c the reasons why it cannot be reasonably estimated 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
we were required to implement this interpretation as of december   and the effect on our consolidated financial statements was not material 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on emeritus 
inflation could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs  which accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended december  in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  the table presents principal repayments in thousands of dollars and current weighted averages of interest rates on these obligations as of december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt fixed rate capital lease and financing obligations convertible debentures our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
we manage this risk by obtaining fixed rate borrowings when possible 
at december   we had no variable rate borrowings 
however  we do have certain operating lease obligations based on libor  with a libor cap of approximately 
as libor rates increase above the current level  we will be exposed to higher lease expense costs 
as of december   the libor rate was 
if libor interest rates were to increase to the cap  our annual facility lease expense would increase and net income would decrease by approximately  this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on these operating lease obligations as of december   and does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
