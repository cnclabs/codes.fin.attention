the company s goal is to sustain profitable  controlled growth by focusing on increased loan and deposit market share  managing yields on earning assets and rates on interest bearing liabilities  increasing non interest income  and being prepared for acquisitions and expansion opportunities within the financial services industry

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of probable losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 

back to table of contents mortgage servicing rights 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when servicing rights are acquired through sale of residential mortgage assets 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into non interest expense in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial residential mortgage assets 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized costs 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
when the book value exceeds its fair value  an impairment allowance is recognized so that mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized book value or fair value 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
on a quarterly basis  an independent third party determines the valuation of the company s mortgage servicing rights asset 
review of financial statements the company declared a stock dividend both in and all financial data included herein has been restated to reflect the impact of the stock dividends

this increase was a result of growth in average interest bearing liabilities of  or and an increase in the cost of funds to in from in management currently anticipates that net interest income will continue to increase in due to expected growth in earning assets primarily loans combined with the benefit of the increase in the federal funds rate 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is a result of management s periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was for and for  an increase of or 
the allowance for loan losses represented of loans outstanding at december   compared to at december  net charge offs were during or 
of average loans outstanding  compared to in or 
the low level of net loan charge offs is indicative of the company s loan quality and credit administration standards and the generally stable economic environment existing in the company s primary market area 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level determined to be adequate by management to absorb future charge offs of loans deemed uncollectible 
this allowance is increased by provisions charged to operating expense and by recoveries on loans previously charged off 
a high degree of judgment is necessary to determine the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and requires management s ongoing evaluation of adequacy 
the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is determined by use of a risk rating system 
the evaluation process includes  among other things  industry standards  management s experience  the bank s historical loan loss experience  evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the final determinations 
future provisions for loan losses depend on such factors as asset quality  net loan charge offs  loan growth and other criteria discussed above 
the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and the corresponding provision will continue to be determined quarterly 
management anticipates that there will be a provision for loan losses in  however  the specific amount cannot be determined at this time 
changes in circumstances affecting the various factors of the company s methodology will determine the provision amount in non interest income non interest income was  for compared to  for  an increase of we experienced growth in most fee categories with service fees on deposit accounts increasing  trust fees growing and other fees increasing

at december   loans under these programs totaled  of which  or of the total loan portfolio outstanding  is guaranteed by the various federal and state government entities 
the bank continues to focus on asset quality issues and emphasizes loan review and underwriting procedures 
the bank utilizes the services of m m to perform periodic loan and documentation review 
management has established a risk rating and review process with the objective of quickly identifying  evaluating and initiating necessary corrective action for all commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the goal of the risk rating process is to address the watch list  substandard and non performing loans  as early as possible 
these components of risk management are integral elements of the bank s loan program which have contributed to the loan portfolio performance to date 
nonetheless  management maintains a cautious outlook in attempting to anticipate the potential effects of uncertain economic conditions both locally and nationally 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  other loans past due over days  foreclosed assets and other real estate owned 
total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to

when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  interest is generally not accrued on loans past due days or more 
the bank does not return a loan to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest  future payments are no longer in doubt  and the loan has been performing for at least six consecutive months

an asset is considered substandard if inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if existing deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted

performing loans represent and of the adversely classified balances as of december  and  respectively 
the bank had no loans which were classified as loss at either date

back to table of contents table allocation of the allowance for loan losses five year schedule the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated 
management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of an allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category 
at december  amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans amount of loans to total loans commercial and commercial real estate construction residential home equity consumer off balance sheet unallocated total allowance for loan losses commercial and commercial real estate loans have been combined in allocating the allowance for loan losses as the company utilizes an internal risk rating system for these loans on a consolidated basis 
the allowance for loan losses represents the amount available for credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
loans are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible  after giving consideration to factors such as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  as well as general and industry economic conditions 
in general  the company determines the appropriate overall allowance for loan losses based upon periodic  systematic reviews of its portfolio to identify inherent losses based on management s judgment about various qualitative factors 
these reviews result in the identification and quantification of loss factors  which are used in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the company periodically evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
portions of the allowance for loan losses are quantified to cover the estimated losses inherent in each loan category based on the results of this detailed review process 
commercial loans are individually reviewed and assigned a credit risk rating from low risk of loss to high risk of loss 
for non impaired loans with a credit risk rating of to  estimated loss factors based on historical loss experience ranging from two to five years are used to calculate a loan loss reserve for each credit risk rating classification 
qualitative adjustments are also made based upon management s assessment of prevailing economic conditions  trends in volumes and terms of loans  levels and trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and the effect of changes in lending policies 
a specific allocation is made for impaired loans  or loans no longer accruing interest as a result of the deemed uncollectibility of interest due  which are measured at the net present value of future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at fair market value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the combination of these analyses is the basis for the determination of the commercial loan portion of the allowance for loan losses 
consumer loans  which include residential mortgages  home equity loans  and direct indirect loans  are generally evaluated as a group based on product type 
the determination of the consumer loan portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on a five year average of annual historical losses  adjusted for the qualitative factors noted above 

back to table of contents at december   the reserve allocated to the commercial and commercial real estate category constitutes of the total allowance for loan losses compared to at december  the change is due to an increase in adversely classified loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for construction  residential  home equity  consumer and off balance sheet remains consistent between years 
the results of all analyses are reviewed and discussed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
an integral component of the company s risk management process is to ensure the proper quantification of the reserve for loan losses based upon an analysis of risk characteristics  demonstrated losses  loan segmentations  and other factors 
reserve methodology is reviewed on a periodic basis and modified as appropriate 
based on this analysis  including the aforementioned assumptions  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate as of december  although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for possible losses  there can be no assurance the bank will not have to increase its provision for possible losses in the future due to increases in non performing assets or otherwise  which would adversely affect the results of operations 
funding and liquidity the company s principal sources of funding are deposits and borrowed funds 
the company has a comprehensive liquidity management program in place 
it maintains adequate funding for its assets by monitoring anticipated sources and uses of funding 
deposits are attracted principally from within the company s primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit products  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit including jumbo certificates in denominations of or more and retirement savings plans 
in addition to traditional in market deposit sources  the company has other sources of liquidity  including proceeds from maturing investment securities and loans  the sale of investment securities  federal funds through correspondent bank relationships  brokered deposits and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
additional liquidity is available in the loan portfolio through sale of residential mortgages and the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
the company also maintains a  credit line with a correspondent bank

asset liability management market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 

back to table of contents the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to its asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income earned and interest expense incurred on all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflected in the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no asset growth  given a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as measured during the th quarter of estimated rate change change in nii bp bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including  among others  the nature and timing of interest rate levels  yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
when appropriate  the company may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
the board of directors approved hedging policy statements govern the use of these instruments 
as of december   the company had a notional principal of  in interest rate swap agreements 
alco monitors derivative activities relative to its expectation and the company s hedging policy 
these instruments are more fully described in note derivative financial instruments within the notes to consolidated financial statements section 
in  the company acquired interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the loan portfolio from a variable rate based upon the prime rate to a fixed rate 
the  of interest rate swap agreements mature in in a purchased interest rate swap agreement  cash interest payments are exchanged between the company and counterparty 
the estimated effects of these derivative financial instruments on the company s earnings are included in the sensitivity analysis presented above 
the risks associated with entering into this transaction are the risk of default by the counterparty with whom the company has entered into the agreement and poor correlation between the rate being swapped and the yield on the hedged assets 
the company s risk from default of a counterparty is limited to the expected cash flow anticipated from the counterparty  not the notional value
