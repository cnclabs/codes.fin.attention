item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a medical device company specializing in innovative technologies for the cardiac and vascular markets 
we currently manufacture two lasers that are used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
our heart laser systems are used to treat patients with severe angina and the optiwave is used to ablate cardiac tissue as a means to treat certain heart arrhythmias 
edwards is our exclusive distributor for tmr products in the united states and our largest customer  accounting for approximately and of our total sales in and  respectively 
we expect this sales trend to continue for the near future 
approximately of our revenues in came from the sale and service of tmr lasers and related disposable kits 
although not a direct measure  we believe a leading indicator of the adoption rate of tmr as a treatment for severe angina is tmr kit shipments to us hospitals 
tmr kit shipments to us hospitals through edwards increased approximately from to we remain largely dependent on the success of edwards sales and marketing efforts to increase our installed base of tmr lasers and increase tmr procedure volumes and revenues 
our management reviews a number of key performance indicators to assist them in determining how to allocate resources and run our day to day operations 
these indicators include actual prior quarterly sales trends  projected tmr laser and kit sales for the next four quarters  as provided by edwards in a rolling twelve month sales forecast  research and development progress as measured against internal project plan objectives  budget to actual financial expenditure results  inventory levels both our own and edwards and short term and long term projected cash flows of the business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require us to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are some of the more material judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed on a first in  first out method or market value and include allocations of labor and overhead 
a specific obsolescence allowance is provided for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based on our best estimate of the net realizable value of inventory on hand taking into consideration factors such as actual trailing twelve month sales  expected future product line demand  based in part on sales forecast input received from edwards  and service part stocking levels which  in management s best judgment  are advisable to maintain in order to meet warranty  service contract and time and material spare part demands 
historically  we have found our reserves to be adequate 
allowance for doubtful accounts for our accounts receivable  we continuously monitor collections from customers  our principal customer being edwards  and we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to our accounts receivable 
collateral is not generally required 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty and preventative maintenance costs we warranty our products against manufacturing defects under normal use and service during the warranty period 
we obtain similar warranties from a majority of our suppliers  including those who supply critical heart laser system components 
in addition  under the terms of our tmr distribution agreement with edwards  we are able to bill edwards for actual warranty costs  including preventative maintenance services  up to a specified amount during the warranty period 
we evaluate the estimated future unrecoverable costs of warranty and preventative maintenance services for our installed base of lasers on a quarterly basis and adjust our warranty reserve accordingly 
we consider all available evidence  including historical experience and information obtained from supplier audits 
revenue recognition we record revenue from the sale of tmr kits and the optiwave at the time of shipment to edwards 
tmr kit revenues include the amount invoiced to edwards for kits shipped pursuant to purchase orders received  as well as an amortized portion of deferred revenue related to edwards payment to us of  in february this payment was made by edwards in exchange for a reduction in the prospective purchase price we receive from edwards upon a sale of the kits 
we are amortizing this payment from edwards into our consolidated statement of operations as revenue over a seven year period culminating in under the units of revenue method as prescribed by emerging issues task force eitf  sales of future revenue 
we determined that a seven year timeframe was the most appropriate amortization period based on a valuation model we used to assess the economic fairness of the payment 
factors we considered in developing this valuation model included the estimated foregone revenues over a seven year period resulting from the reduction in the prospective purchase price payable to us by edwards  a discount rate deemed appropriate to this transaction and an estimate of the remaining economic useful life of the current tmr kit design  without any benefit being given to potential future product improvements we may make 
management reviews annually  and adjusts if necessary  the prospective revenue amortization rate for kits based on its best estimate of the total number of kits likely remaining to be shipped to hospital customers by edwards through based on this  and for the years ended december  and  we recorded amortization of  and  respectively  which is included in revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
tmr lasers are billed to edwards in accordance with purchase orders that we receive 
invoiced tmr lasers are recorded as other current assets and deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet until such time as the laser is shipped to a hospital  at which time we record revenue and cost of revenue 
under the terms of the edwards tmr distribution agreement  once edwards has recovered a prescribed amount of revenue from a hospital for the use or purchase of a tmr laser  any additional revenues earned by edwards are shared with us pursuant to a formula established in the distribution agreement 
we only record our share of such additional revenue  if any  at the time the revenue is earned 
we record revenue from the sale of tmr kits and tmr lasers to international distributors or hospitals at the time of shipment 
revenues from service and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
installation revenues related to a tmr laser transaction are recorded as a component of service fees when the laser is installed 
results of operations results for the past three years and the related percent of revenues were as follows dollars in thousands total revenues total cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative research development income loss from operations other income liquidation of subsidiary foreign currency loss income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss increase decrease over increase decrease over dollars in thousands product sales service fees total revenues product cost of sales service fees cost of sales total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general administrative expenses research development expenses total operating expenses liquidation of subsidiary foreign currency loss other income income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss product sales tmr laser revenues  the largest component of product sales in  decreased by  or  as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a  or  decrease in domestic tmr laser revenues generated through our edwards sales channel 
the  decline in domestic tmr laser revenues is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of new tmr lasers sold by edwards in compared to and decreased revenue sharing earned under the tmr distribution agreement with edwards 
these decreases were offset in part by a higher average selling price in on domestic tmr laser sales 
international tmr laser revenues decreased  or  in as compared to disposable tmr kit revenues  the second largest component of product sales  increased by  or  in as compared to the increase is primarily related to a  or  increase in domestic disposable revenue resulting from a higher volume of kit shipments to edwards and a  increase in deferred revenue amortization related to the  payment by edwards 
international disposable tmr kit revenues increased  or  in as compared to optiwave revenues to edwards increased  or  as compared to due to a higher number of optiwave units sold to edwards in under our new supply agreement with edwards that we entered into in march  edwards has agreed to purchase any additional units of the current generation of optiwave exclusively from us 
we believe that our future revenues from sales of this first generation laser will not exceed  and may be less  depending in part on demand for that product and when  if ever  edwards chooses to introduce its next generation laser to the market 
we have a right of first refusal to develop and manufacture the next generation laser for edwards  however  at this time we have not had discussions with edwards regarding any such successor product 
other product sales  relating to sales of new and refurbished surgical tubes  decreased  or  as compared to tmr laser revenues  the largest component of product sales in  decreased by  or  as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a  or  decrease in domestic tmr laser revenues generated through our edwards sales channel 
the  decline in domestic tmr laser revenues is primarily a result of both a decrease in the number of new tmr laser units sold by edwards in compared to and a lower average domestic selling price on tmr laser sales down in international tmr laser revenues decreased by  or  in although we shipped a greater number of hl tmr lasers in compared to  the lasers we did sell were at a lower average selling price 
we believe the hl may continue to have some ability to be sold in price sensitive foreign countries  however  we expect the number to be in limited quantities  if any 
disposable tmr kit revenues  the second largest component of product sales  decreased by  or  in as compared to the decrease is primarily related to a  or  decrease in domestic disposable revenue 
this  decrease resulted from a lower volume of kit shipments to edwards coupled with a reduced share of revenue on tmr kits 
the reduced share of revenue on tmr kits is a result of a modification to the tmr distribution agreement in february  whereby our share of the revenue on tmr kits sold to hospitals was reduced from to in exchange for a payment by edwards of  the impact of this reduction to compared to what disposable revenue would have been at was a reduction in revenue of  in this impact was offset in part by the recognition of  of deferred revenue amortization in related to the  payment by edwards 
international disposable revenue decreased by  or  due to a decrease in the number of tmr kits shipped to international customers in compared to and a lower overall average selling price in on those kits that were sold 
the decline in average sale price is the result of a greater number of kits being sold outside the european union in compared to a greater number of the kits sold in were to countries located in latin america and the middle east  where we believe pricing pressures are greater and where we sell through distributors at a discount off of list price 
optiwave revenues to edwards  a new component of product sales in  increased  as compared to when we had no such sales 
other product sales  relating to sales of new and refurbished surgical tubes  increased  or  in service fee revenues service fees decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease is primarily a result of decreased international service fee revenues due to decreased service billings to international customers 
service fees increased  or  in as compared to this increase is primarily a result of increased international revenues due to an increase in billings to international customers as compared to gross profit total gross profit was  or  of total revenues  for the year ended december  as compared with gross profit of  or  of total revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit dollars in as compared to is due to higher disposable tmr revenues and a higher average domestic selling price on tmr laser sales 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in additional revenue sharing earned under the tmr distribution agreement  a decrease in service related revenues  a decrease in the number of new tmr lasers sold and higher unabsorbed period overhead expenses 
total gross profit was  or  of total revenues  for the year ended december  as compared with gross profit of  or  of total revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit dollars in as compared to is due to a decrease in the number of new tmr lasers sold  lower disposable tmr revenues  lower revenues on hl transactions and a  decrease in benefit derived from a reduction of our warranty accrual in these decreases were offset in part by new product sales of optiwave and an increase in service related revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses the overall level of expenditures remained relatively unchanged in as compared to salary and related fringe benefits  insurance  depreciation and software expenditures increased while legal and other related corporate expenditures decreased by similar offsetting amounts 
the overall increase in as compared to is primarily a result of increased expenditures related to legal fees of  offset in part by reduced international expenditures of  due to the closing of our swiss subsidiary in late and other general corporate expenditures 
research and development expenses research and development expenditures increased in as compared to primarily due to increased expenditures in connection with product development work on an additional internal research and development initiative 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in optiwave system expenditures in the transition of the optiwave from research and development to manufacturing in late contributed to a decrease of expenditures in this area in the increased expenditures in as compared to were incurred in connection with the development of the optiwave system due to increased salaries and associated fringe benefits  project materials and depreciation related to this program and additional product development work on longer term research and development projects 
these increases were offset in part by a  reduction in an accrued liability related to a past clinical trial that we no longer deemed necessary 
we expect to continue to incur significant new research and development expenditures in and future years in pursuit of our business strategy to broaden and diversify our product portfolio beyond our current tmr offerings 
other income the largest component of other income is interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased  in as compared to primarily due to higher interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income was negatively impacted in comparison to the comparable period in as a result of a  insurance settlement received in interest income increased  in as compared to due to higher average cash balances 
other income increased  in as a result of an insurance settlement received in liquidation of subsidiary foreign currency loss in  we decided to close our swiss subsidiary 
in closing that subsidiary  we realized a non recurring foreign currency translation loss of  in the year ended december  provision for income taxes in  there was no provision for income taxes due to our net loss 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes due to limitations on the utilization of us net operating loss carryforwards being available to reduce taxable income 
in  there was no provision for income tax despite a recorded net profit of  due to the utilization of us net operating loss carryforwards being available to reduce taxable income 
net income loss the net loss increased in as compared to primarily due to increased research and development expenses 
the change from net income in to a net loss in resulted primarily from lower gross margin dollars generated on lower overall sales coupled with higher research and development expenses 
kit shipments we view disposable kit shipments to end users as an important metric in evaluating our business 
we believe that kit shipments particularly kit shipments to us hospitals  although not a direct measure  are a reasonable indicator for the adoption of tmr as a therapy in the marketplace 
disposable kit shipments to end users are as follows increase decrease over increase decrease over domestic by edwards international total we believe the growth in domestic kit shipments in was primarily due to an increased base of installed tmr lasers available to perform tmr procedures and diminished concerns regarding the reimbursement around the tmr procedure that arose in  as explained below 
we believe the limited growth in domestic kit shipments in was in part a result of some uncertainty surrounding reimbursement for the tmr procedure that was created when the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms convened an advisory panel meeting in july to review and discuss the evidence and clinical data regarding tmr  even though no changes to medicare coverage resulted from this panel meeting 
we believe this uncertainty  which has since diminished  adversely impacted edwards sales of tmr kits in the overall limited growth in tmr kit shipments in recent years may also be partly attributable to what we believe may be an ongoing downward trend in the number of bypass surgeries being performed 
we believe the proliferation in the number of interventional cardiac procedures being performed  particularly with the recent advent in the use of drug eluting stents  is causing a delay in the number of patients being referred to cardiac surgeons for treatment of their cardiovascular disease 
because a significant number of the total tmr procedures performed each year by cardiac surgeons are done in combination with bypass surgery  we believe the growth in the number of tmr procedures may be being adversely impacted by this reduction in the number of bypass surgeries being performed 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  as of december   a decrease of  from  as of december  in march  we received  related to the sale of our optiwave system related disposable manufacturing and development rights to edwards see note 
our short term investments consist of monies invested in bank certificates of deposit 
we have no debt obligations 
we believe that our existing cash resources will meet our working capital requirements through at least the next months 
cash used for operations in was  due to our net loss  which was partially offset by a reduction in our accounts receivable as a result of cash collections from our customers  as well as other favorable working capital changes and non cash depreciation and amortization 
cash was also used to purchase  of capital equipment 
cash provided by financing activities consisted of  of net proceeds from the sales of common shares 
the effect of foreign exchange rate changes during also negatively impacted cash by  we are largely dependent on the success of edwards sales and marketing efforts in the us to continue to increase the installed base of hl and optiwave lasers and to substantially increase tmr procedural volumes and revenues 
should the installed base of hl lasers or tmr procedural volume not increase sufficiently  our liquidity and capital resources will be negatively impacted 
additionally  other unanticipated decreases in operating revenues or increases in expenses or changes or delays in third party reimbursement to healthcare providers using our products may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions or the need to obtain additional financing 
it is not certain that we  working with edwards and our international distributors  will be successful in achieving broad commercial acceptance of either the heart laser systems or the optiwave  or that we will be able to operate profitably in the future on a consistent basis  if at all 
some hospital customers prefer to acquire the heart laser systems on a usage basis rather than as a capital equipment purchase 
we believe this is the result of limitations many hospitals currently have on acquiring expensive capital equipment as well as competitive pressures in the marketplace 
a usage business model will result in a longer recovery period for edwards to recoup its investment in lasers it purchases from us 
this results in a delay in our ability to receive additional shared revenue  if any  that we otherwise are entitled to receive under the terms of our distribution agreement with edwards see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and a delay in the purchase of new lasers by edwards if its installed base of lasers placed under usage contracts are under performing and it chooses to re deploy these lasers to other hospital sites in lieu of purchasing a new laser from us 
our cash position and our need for additional financing to fund operations will be dependent in part upon the number of hospitals that acquire heart laser systems from edwards on a usage basis and the number and frequency of tmr procedures performed by these hospitals 
furthermore  we have undertaken a new business strategy that involves broadening and diversifying our product portfolio beyond our current tmr offerings  by developing or acquiring new and innovative medical devices to address cardiac and vascular related markets 
we believe this strategy will result in our incurring losses for at least the next months as we increase our spending in the area of research and development 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing our business strategy or that future sales  if any  from these planned new products will recover the investments we plan to make 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our business strategy  or if the diversification of our product portfolio takes longer or costs more than anticipated  our liquidity and capital resources will be adversely affected and we may need to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that  should we require additional financing  such financing will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
should additional financing not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us  additional actions may be required that could adversely impact our ability to continue to realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements set forth in this report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of these uncertainties 
contractual obligations our long term contractual commitments as of december  consisted of operating leases for our facility in franklin  massachusetts  which expires in august  and our former facility in billerica  massachusetts  which expired in february  and purchase commitments to make payments to suppliers 
future annual minimum payments for these contractual obligations are as follows payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of our operations consists of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products exclusively in the us and sell our products in the us and abroad 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  especially the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the euro  the value of foreign sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of sales increases 
no assurance can be given that foreign currency fluctuations in the future will not adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  although at present we do not believe that our exposure is significant as international sales represented only of our consolidated sales in we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us and foreign interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and foreign interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
we do not believe that a change to the applicable interest rates would have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows
