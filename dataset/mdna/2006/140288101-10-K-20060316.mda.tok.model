item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
where appropriate  the following discussion includes analysis of our predecessor entity 
overview we are a diversified reit that owns and finances primarily single tenant commercial real estate assets subject to long term leases to primarily investment grade tenants 
we focus on properties that are subject to a net lease 
see business overview for how we define a net lease 
we invest at all levels of the capital structure of net lease properties  including equity investments in real estate owned real properties  debt investments mortgage loans and net lease mortgage backed securities and mezzanine investments secured by net leased real estate collateral 
the principal sources of our revenues are rental income on our owned real properties and interest income from our debt investments 
the principal sources of our expenses are interest expense on our assets financed  depreciation expense on our real properties  general and administrative expenses and property expenses net of expense recoveries 
while our focus is on net leased properties  we also have made and expect to continue to make owned property investments where we have exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
we seek to finance our assets on a long term basis with fixed rate debt of a like maturity 
through december   our long term financings have been in the form of traditional third party mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and our first cdo completed in march 
we have short term floating rate borrowing arrangements in place to facilitate our investment activity while we arrange long term financing 
we employ a hedging strategy to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates while our assets are financed under our short term borrowing arrangements 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
our primary business objective is to generate stable  long term and attractive returns based on the spread between the yields generated by our assets and the cost of financing our portfolio 
we rely primarily on equity and debt capital to fund our portfolio growth 
the following is a summary of our capital raising activities beginning with our initial public offering in march month year securities issued price net proceeds march million shares of common stock million october million shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock million december million of junior subordinated notes n a million summary of investment activity in the following summarizes certain aspects of our portfolio investment and financing activity during the year ended december we originated assets of approximately million  including the acquisition of real properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and the origination of million of loan investments net of loans sold  comprised of mortgage loans  corporate credit notes and mezzanine investments 
we closed our first cdo financing in march and financed our real property acquisitions with million of fixed rate mortgage debt including million of debt assumed at its fair market value 
the net amount of financing we issued in our cdo was million  and was secured by approximately million of assets at closing 
business environment the markets have been and remain extremely competitive across each of our business segments 
we continue to see significant amounts of investment capital pursuing transactions across the real estate spectrum which has put downward pressure on yields and spreads on both property acquisitions and our origination of loans for our portfolio 
this trend has resulted in our making a limited number of investments in net lease assets in with return characteristics at the lower end of our target return criteria 
if this trend continues in  we may continue to look to invest in net lease assets with return characteristics at the lower end of our target return criteria  we may re adjust our target returns  or our asset origination activity may slow while we continue to pursue only those assets at or above the returns being generated by our current portfolio 
winn dixie bankruptcy we have exposure to winn dixie through securities we own from our past securitizations 
during the year ended december   we took certain actions to significantly reduce this exposure 
we  as the owner of the most subordinate security class in the cmlbc securitization transaction the trust  directed the trust s special servicer to sell all of the million of pass through certificates included as collateral in the trust 
the sales were made in the third quarter of as a result of these sales  the primary exposure to the trust from winn dixie backed collateral was removed  and the trust had realized losses that impacted the carry value of the most junior classes of securities held by us 
accordingly  we recognized a realized loss on these securities in the year ended december  of approximately million  and a non cash mark to market loss attributed to the reduction in the carry value of these securities in the amount of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we also recorded aggregate losses of approximately million on the most junior class class f of the bscms securitization transaction  based on our updated analysis of the likely value of the future cash flows from this security 
these write downs are in addition to the write down of approximately million we took at december  as a result of the actions described above  we have removed all of our expected exposure to the winn dixie bankruptcy in the cmlbc transaction and we have dramatically reduced our exposure to winn dixie overall 
we believe that any remaining credit risk we have to the winn dixie bankruptcy is within the bscms transaction that includes one store in rainsville  alabama where winn dixie has rejected the lease on that store and the loan on the property is in default 
the property is in the process of being liquidated  and we have estimated the losses within the securitization based on our estimates of the net recovery value of the property 
we believe we have been reasonable with our estimates  but our estimates may be inaccurate and  therefore  we cannot assure you that we will not need to take additional losses or reserves or that our losses as a result of the winn dixie bankruptcy will not be greater than our current estimates 
we do not believe any additional losses that we will have to take as a result of winn dixie will be material 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
mortgage and other real estate loans held for investment 
prior to our initial public offering  our investments in mortgage loans were treated as investments held for sale and carried on our balance sheet at the lower of cost or market 
since our initial public offering  our loan investments have been  and we expect in the future they will continue to be  accounted for as long term investments  as our strategy contemplates that we hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity 
differences between the carrying amount of the loan and its outstanding principal balance are recognized as an adjustment to our yield by the effective interest method 
we are required to periodically evaluate each of our loans held for investment for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the asset 
upon determination of impairment  we must establish a specific valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance 
in determining impairment and any loan loss allowance  we will be required to evaluate our assets  historical and industry loss experience  economic conditions and trends  collateral values and quality  and other relevant factors 
as of december   we had no loss allowances on any of the loans in our portfolio 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to the following based on fair value acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases and the value of tenant relationships 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence activities and other market data  and utilize various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the differences between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease 
fair market lease rates are measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market rate renewal options for below market leases 
in computing present value  we use a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values and tenant relationship values which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during the hypothetical expected time it would take management to find a tenant to lease the space for the existing lease term a lease up period considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
management estimates carrying costs  including such factors as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses during the expected lease up period  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
through december   we have assigned no value to tenant relationships on any of our acquisitions 
securities available for sale 
we treat our real estate securities as available for sale and account for them in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as such  they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported on our balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
fair value is based primarily upon our estimates of value  based upon broker quotations where available  yields on assets of similar credit quality and duration  or good faith estimates of those yields 
the indicated quotations may be subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and spreads 
while a liquid market for these securities typically exists  the securities may not be frequently traded and  therefore  we may not be able to sell them at our estimates of value 
changes in market conditions  as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value  could result in a significant increase or decrease in the equity on our balance sheet 
we must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities  if any  reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary 
if so  we must write the impaired security down to its value through a charge to our income statement 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates typically temporary or credit downgrades or credit defaults typically other than temporary 
for the year ended december   we recorded aggregate write downs of approximately million on one of our real estate securities  reflecting our estimate of our losses on that security as a result of the winn dixie bankruptcy 
we also recorded a million write down on the same security as of december   again reflecting our estimated loss on the security as a result of the winn dixie bankruptcy at that time 
also during  we recognized an approximately million loss on another real estate security  including an approximately million realized loss and an approximately million mark to market loss resulting from the sale of winn dixie collateral in the related cmbs trust 
see winn dixie bankruptcy above 
income on our securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
these assumptions include the expected disposal date of the security and the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts which may be subject to prepayments  delinquencies and defaults 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events and economic and market conditions  which may alter the assumptions 
impairment on owned real properties we own real properties for investment 
we review these properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon determination of impairment  we would record a write down of the asset  which would be charged to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting write down 
through december   we have determined that no write downs have been necessary on any of our owned real properties 
derivative instruments and other risk management transactions 
our derivative instruments and other risk management transactions  which we hold for hedging or other risk management purposes  are carried at fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
fair value is based on market quotations 
fair values on such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as our securities available for sale discussed above 
further  to the extent the derivatives qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity on our balance sheet  otherwise they are reported as a component of current income or loss on our income statement 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  our derivatives must meet various technical requirements under sfas  including satisfying hedge effectiveness testing at each reporting date 
failure to meet these requirements would result in the change in value of the derivative instrument being charged directly to our income statement without any offset from the change in fair value of the related hedged transaction 
revenue recognition 
as part of our year credit tenant loan program  we originate a loan and split it into two notes  a real estate note and a corporate credit note 
we generally sell the real estate note to a third party and retain the corporate credit note in our portfolio 
during  we sold three real estate notes for aggregate proceeds of million  and recognized gains of million 
we compute our gain by comparing our sales proceeds on the note to its cost basis 
we compute our cost basis on the note by allocating our entire basis in the loan among the two notes based on the present value of expected cash flows on each note 
in computing present values  we estimate a discount rate based on a benchmark united states treasury rate plus a market spread based on the underlying credit 
our estimates reflect market rates and we believe they are reasonable 
however  the use of different estimates could have an impact on our gain on sale revenue 
stock based compensation 
pursuant to our stock incentive plan  we have made and expect to continue to make awards of common stock to our employees with vesting subject to attainment of performance criteria 
under sfas no 
and sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  we are and will be required to estimate the probability of vesting of these shares quarterly and recognize expense generally equal to the fair market value of the shares awarded on the grant date for any shares deemed probable to vest over the period the employee is required to perform services to receive the shares 
we base our estimates of probability on an assessment of our actual results against the relevant performance criteria 
these estimates may change over time as our actual results against the criteria are re assessed 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the expense we recognize 
property acquisitions during the quarter ended december   we completed the following property acquisitions dollar amounts in thousands month acquired tenant or guarantor location purchase price lease expires net rentable square feet december allstate insurance company various december december farmers new world life insurance company mercer island  wa december the company acquired a portfolio of three properties  one located in each of roanoke  virginia  charlotte  north carolina  and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have classified the allstate pittsburgh property as assets held for sale on our december  consolidated balance sheet  reflecting our intent to sell the property promptly following its acquisition 
we treated the revenues from the property as income from discontinued operations on our consolidated income statement for the year ended december  based on initial pricing expectations  we expect to recognize a gain on the sale of the property and  therefore  no impairment loss on the property has been recognized 
business segments we conduct our business through two operating segments operating net lease real estate including our investments in owned real properties  and lending investments including our loan investments as well as our investments in securities 
segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating net lease real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses minority interest income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating net lease real estate lending investments total total revenues total expenses minority interest income loss from continuing operations total assets prior to our initial public offering in march  we had no owned real property investments and our net lease mortgage loan business was under a gain on sale rather than portfolio business model 
results of operations during the year ended december   we continued to execute on our business plan as a long term holder of equity  debt and mezzanine investments in net lease assets 
our focus during the year was on i identifying and acquiring net lease assets that met our investment criteria  ii financing our net lease assets  including the closing of our first collateralized debt obligation  iii raising additional capital to fund the growth of our portfolio  and iv continuing to communicate our expanded capabilities to the net lease marketplace 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental income and property expense recoveries and increases in interest income  offset in part by decreases in gain on sale of loans and securities and other revenue 
rental income and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million 
we continued to make significant investments of owned properties during  and the significant increase in revenues associated with these investments is a result of the large growth in this portion of our overall investment portfolio 
rental income for the period includes million from assets consolidated under fin as described in footnote in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  we were required under fin to recognize revenue and expense on one of our real property purchases prior to our acquisition date because a deposit we made on our purchase price had become non refundable 
interest income increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to larger overall asset investments  including both loans and securities investments 
gain on sale of loans and securities decreased from million to million 
the decrease was due to lower overall sales activity during compared with expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to increases in interest expense  property related expenses and general and administrative expenses  offset in part by a reduction in loss on derivatives 
interest expense increased million  or  from million to million 
the increase was primarily the result of million of increased interest expense on our property mortgages and million of interest expenses on our cdo borrowings 
in addition  interest expense on our borrowings under our repurchase agreement increased million  or  from million to million 
this was the result of higher average borrowing levels and higher rates of interest on our repurchase agreement borrowings in the results also include interest expense of million from assets consolidated under fin property expense increased from million to million 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million 
the growth in property expenses reflects the growth of our portfolio as well as our purchase of properties with greater overall exposure to property expenses under the lease provisions  primarily with respect to leases with the united states government 
while our investment focus continues to be on net leased properties  we expect to continue to pursue properties where we have exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
property expenses for the period include million of expense from assets consolidated under fin gain loss on derivatives was million for  compared to million in the gain represents hedge ineffectiveness related to open derivative positions as of december  the expense represents carry costs of hedges and short sale positions that were in place prior to our initial public offering 
prior to our initial public offering  we employed fair value hedges of our assets  along with derivatives and short sales of securities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
after our initial public offering date  we terminated all of the outstanding fair value hedges  derivative and short sale positions  and converted to cash flow hedges against our expected future financings 
loss on securities was million related to a write down on three of our real estate securities  reflecting our actual and mark to market losses on those securities as a result of the winn dixie bankruptcy 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  due primarily to increased expenses associated with our status as a public company  including expenses associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  accounting and assurance expenses  personnel costs and liability insurance 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation of million was recognized during the period 
this represents vesting of stock awards made in and under our stock plan 
these shares vest through march and  as of december   million of deferred compensation expense was included on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of additional paid in capital 
this amount is expected to be charged to our income statement ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
the amount of deferred compensation expense for awards of  shares made in has not yet been measured and included as a component of additional paid in capital because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance has not yet occurred 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or to million  as a result of the significant increases in real estate investments made during depreciation and amortization expense for the period includes million of expense from assets consolidated under fin minority interest 
minority interest in consolidated entities is million as a result of the assets consolidated under fin as discussed above 
net income 
net income increased from million to million  as a result of the factors discussed above 
net income allocable to common stockholders was million in comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in interest income from mortgage loans and securities and increases in rental revenue  offset by a decrease in gain on sale of mortgage loans 
interest income increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to larger overall asset investments  including both mortgage loans and cmbs investments 
gain on sale of mortgage loans and securities decreased from million to million 
the decrease was due to curtailment on our loan sale activity during  as we transitioned from a gain on sale to held for investment strategy upon completion of our initial public offering 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million to million  as we did not own any investments in real estate during other revenue increased million to million  primarily as a result of receiving million after related expenses as a deal cancellation fee on a potential property acquisition 
expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to higher levels of general and administrative expenses as a result of our status as a public company  and increases in property related expenses  offset by a reduction in loss on derivatives 
interest expense  including interest expense to affiliates  increased million  or  from million to million 
this primarily consisted of million of interest expense related to property mortgages originated or assumed in in addition  interest expense on our borrowings under our repurchase agreements decreased million  or  from million to million 
this was the result of lower average borrowing levels in after the completion of our initial public offering in march  we repaid all of the amounts outstanding under our repurchase agreements 
we began borrowing under these facilities again during august loss on derivatives decreased million  or  from million to million 
this was primarily the result of the change in the way we hedge interest rates upon the completion of our initial public offering 
prior to our initial public offering  we employed fair value hedges of our assets  along with derivatives and short sales of securities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
after our initial public offering date  we terminated all of the outstanding fair value hedges  derivative and short sale positions  and converted to cash flow hedges against our expected future financings 
loss on securities was million for a write down on one of our real estate securities  reflecting our estimate of loss on that security as a result of the winn dixie bankruptcy 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  due primarily to increased expenses associated with our change to operating as a public company  including liability insurance 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation of million was recognized during the period 
million related to vesting of stock awards made in march under our stock plan 
these shares vest through march and  as of december   million of deferred compensation expense was included on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of additional paid in capital 
this amount is expected to be charged to our income statement ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
the expense also included million recognized during the quarter ended march  related to stock sold to certain current and former employees during november at a discount to the initial public offering price 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million to million  as we did not own any investments in real estate during net income 
net income decreased from million to million  as a result of the factors discussed above 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for real estate depreciation  a non cash expense which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of a reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income to ffo for the years ended december  and december  ffo is not a relevant measure for us for years prior to because we were not a reit during those periods 
year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income allocable to common stockholders adjustments add depreciation and amortization expense on real property funds from operations weighted average number of common shares oustanding  basic and diluted funds from operations per share gain on sale of mortgage loans and securities depreciation on real estate investments consolidated under fin liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december   including in the first  second and third quarters and in the fourth quarter 
we also declared a dividend of 
per share of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in the fourth quarter of we believe that our working capital and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and pay our distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  our strategy contemplates additional net lease investments and  therefore  as we approach or reach our target leverage level from time to time  we will need to raise additional capital 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
as of december   we had an effective shelf registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities from time to time 
we raised additional equity capital through a public offering in october and debt capital through a private placement in december in october  we issued  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in a public offering at a price to the public of per share  and raised net proceeds of approximately million  after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
the shares were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
in december  we issued million in junior subordinated notes to an affiliate  caplease statutory trust i  in exchange for million of the trust s common securities and million received by the trust from issuing its trust preferred securities to unrelated third party investors 
the junior subordinated notes  the common and the trust preferred securities have substantially identical terms  requiring quarterly interest payments calculated at a fixed interest rate equal to per annum through january   and subsequently at a variable interest rate equal to london interbank offered rate libor plus per annum 
the notes mature on january   and may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at par  at our option  beginning on january  the preferred and common securities do not have a stated maturity date  however  they are subject to mandatory redemption upon the redemption or maturity of the notes 
our investment in the trust is not eliminated from our financial statements in consolidation 
instead  we record our investment in the trust s common shares of million as part of other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect the proceeds raised in the fourth quarter of will be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our growth strategy through the first quarter of we expect to raise additional capital in the near future  either in the form of common stock  preferred stock  trust preferred debt or a combination thereof 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
short term liquidity and financing 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  as well as through our short term borrowing arrangements 
our short term borrowing arrangements are comprised of a repurchase agreement with wachovia bank aggregate borrowing capacity of million and a real property acquisition facility with wachovia bank and one of its affiliates two loan agreements with aggregate borrowing capacity of million 
these arrangements are uncommitted  meaning the lenders may decline to advance on any asset we seek to finance 
we had million outstanding as of december  under our wachovia repurchase agreement  which borrowings were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  and securities with a carry value of million 
as of december   we had not yet drawn under our real property acquisition facility 
our short term borrowing arrangements are co terminus  and they expire in august we expect to renew these arrangements prior to expiration 
we had a repurchase agreement with bank of america that expired unused on march  our short term borrowing arrangements allow us to finance our assets on a short term basis while we arrange long term financing 
we pay interest at prevailing short term interest rates plus a spread 
these borrowing arrangements are secured by the assets financed and are fully recourse to our other assets 
our lender also has the right to initiate a margin call if our assets financed decline in value including as a result of a tenant downgrade 
we are required to comply with various covenants under these arrangements  including financial covenants of minimum liquidity  minimum consolidated net worth and maximum leverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with the terms of our short term borrowing arrangements 
we do not currently anticipate any difficulty in maintaining compliance with these terms in future periods 
we believe our relationship with wachovia bank is excellent 
however  because our short term borrowing arrangements are uncommitted  we cannot make any assurance that these facilities will continue to be available to us 
long term liquidity and financing 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements generally through cash provided by operations  long term fixed rate financings on our net lease asset investments and issuances of debt and equity capital 
as discussed in further detail above  we issued preferred equity capital in october and debt capital in december we finance our investments through short term financing arrangements and  as soon as practicable thereafter  we obtain long term financing for these investments  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
long term financing can be in the form of traditional mortgage debt  cdos or other debt mechanisms 
as of december   we have financed on a long term basis an aggregate of approximately million of assets in portfolio with third party mortgage debt of million and collateralized debt obligations of million 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
long term mortgage financings 
during the year ended december   we obtained million of long term third party mortgage financing on our real property acquisitions 
we also assumed debt of an aggregate of million fair market value of debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of two of real properties 
our mortgage financings are fixed rate financings 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years  and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are generally non recourse to us but are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes generally include customary non recourse exceptions 
the notes often include an interest only payment period and usually require a balloon payment at maturity 
cdo financing 
in march  we completed our first cdo 
our cdo was an entirely fixed rate financing 
we aggregated approximately million of assets into the pool  and we created million face amount of multi class notes and million of preferred equity through the cdo trust 
the net amount of the debt we issued was million  inclusive of a million discount to face  as we retained the three most junior note classes aggregating a face amount of million and the full million of preferred equity 
each of the five note classes of the cdo was rated investment grade 
during the first five years of the cdo term  we expect to reinvest principal repayments on the underlying assets into qualifying replacement collateral 
the cdo notes are expected to mature in january our effective blended financing rate inclusive of original issue discount and debt issuance and hedge costs on our cdo is approximately 
our cdo debt is non recourse to us but is secured by the assets in the pool 
we are currently aggregating assets for our next cdo financing 
we expect our next cdo issuance to occur in the second or third quarter of statement of cash flows we used million of cash in operating activities in our net income as adjusted for straight lining of rents  various non cash gains and losses and depreciation and amortization charges was million  but was offset by increases in other assets of million net of million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  decreases in deposits and escrows of million and amounts due to servicers and dealers of million 
the increase in other assets in was driven by million of funds being held by our cdo trustee at year end pending distribution or reinvestment  million of cash being held in escrow by our mortgage lenders to fund various property related costs like tenant improvements  capital expenditures and property expenses  and million of rents receivable on several of our owned properties 
during  most of the cash we had collected in in the form of deposits and escrows and amounts due to servicers was paid back 
our net cash provided by operating activities in was million and reflects adjustments for non cash items of expenses for amortization of stock based compensation million and depreciation and amortization million  including million on real property 
our net cash provided by operating activities in also reflects adjustments for non cash items for amortization of above and below market rents million  straight lining of rents million and amortization of discounts premiums  and origination fees costs million 
our net cash used in operating activities was million in the change from to was primarily a result of our transition to a portfolio business model in the first quarter of prior to our initial public offering  our loan and security investment activity was classified as operating activities 
under our current strategy  these investments are treated as investing activities

investing activities used million during the year ended december   which primarily resulted from net investments in real estate of million  net investments in mortgage loans of million and net investments in securities available for sale of million 
investing activities used million during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  reflecting net borrowings from mortgages on real estate investments of million  borrowings from collateralized debt obligations of million  proceeds from a preferred stock equity offering of million  and borrowings from other long term debt obligations of million  offset in part by  dividends paid on common shares of million  funds used in hedging and risk management activities of million  a construction escrow held with our mortgage lender of million  debt issuance costs of million  and net repayments on repurchase agreement obligations of million 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  reflecting net proceeds from our initial public offering of million before prepaid offering expenses of approximately million  net borrowings under long term mortgage financings of million  net borrowings under repurchase agreements of million  partially offset by dividends paid of million 
we used million of our net proceeds from the initial public offering to repay our repurchase agreement borrowings 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million and was primarily the result of net repurchase agreement borrowings 
see our consolidated statements of cash flows in the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described above 
derivative and other risk management transactions since our initial public offering  we have entered into derivative and other risk management transactions in order to hedge the value of our future debt obligations from changes in underlying interest rates during the period between closing and obtaining long term financing of our net lease assets 
our derivative and other risk management activities during this period have consisted primarily of interest rate swaps  and we expect they will continue to consist primarily of interest rate swaps in the future 
in accordance with sfas  the interest rate swaps  to the extent that they have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship  are treated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
consistent with sfas no 
 open cash flow hedges are marked to fair value at each reporting date  with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity 
the cost to carry our open cash flow hedges and any gain or loss we realize upon closing the cash flow hedge is amortized as part of interest expense over the term of the related debt issuance 
prior to our initial public offering  we used risk management transactions to hedge the interest rate risk associated with owning fixed rate mortgage loan assets financed by floating rate debt 
we did so primarily by entering into treasury and agency lock transactions and short sales of us government and agency obligations 
in accordance with sfas  these lock transactions and short sales  to the extent that they were designated and qualified as part of a hedging relationship  were treated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes 
consistent with sfas no 
 open fair value hedges are marked to fair value at each reporting date  with the change in value as offset by any gain or loss on the hedged item recognized in earnings currently 
the cost to carry our open fair value hedges appears on our consolidated income statement as part of gain or loss on derivatives 
for the years ended december  and  we had net realized losses of million and million  respectively  related to cash flow hedges 
the net realized losses are included in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified and amortized as part of interest expense on our consolidated income statement over the expected term of the related debt issuances 
within the next twelve months  we estimate that million of losses currently held within accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings as additional interest expense 
the change in net unrealized gains and losses of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is separately disclosed in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
gain loss on derivatives on our consolidated income statement includes million of gain due to hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we reclassified million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense related to the underlying debt issuances 
we do not use derivative and other risk management transactions for trading or speculative purposes and we only enter into contracts or hedging arrangements with major financial institutions 
we settle our derivative and other risk management transactions in cash 
therefore  upon settlement  we will pay or receive cash for the net amount due 
these amounts could be material and could have a material impact positive or negative on our liquidity 
we seek to settle these transactions simultaneous with the closing of our financing transaction for the related hedged asset to mitigate the possible adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years mortgages on real estate investments collateralized debt obligations other long term debt operating leases repurchase agreement obligations total negative amounts shown with respect to our collateralized debt obligations represent amortization of original issue discount 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements 
we are obligated under two letters of credit in the aggregate of million in connection with obtaining long term financing on two real properties we acquired during the letters of credit were issued to our lender for the full amount of financing on each property 
the lender may draw on the letters of credit if it does not receive evidence that a certificate of occupancy for the related property has been obtained  construction of the property has been completed and there has been no default on the underlying lease by a fixed date april  in the case of our gsa dea property and june  in the case of our gsa ssa property 
we do not expect any draw on either of these letters of credit 
we have funded a reserve account to fund expected property improvements on one of the real properties we acquired during during the quarter ended june   we acquired a real property in herndon  virginia net leased to itt industries  inc  and agreed under the tenant s lease to fund expected improvements to the real property of approximately million 
during the quarter ended june   we arranged long term financing on this property and funded a reserve account with our lender for the full amount of this obligation 
we expect these funds will be disbursed in full as improvements are completed 
as of december   approximately million of these funds have been disbursed 
we are obligated under a letter of credit with respect to one of our prior securitization transactions bscms clf 
the maximum potential amount of future required payments under the letter of credit is million 
the letter of credit expires on february  the trustee of the securitization trust may draw the letter of credit if there are realized losses on the mortgage loans in the collateral pool that would create a shortfall in the interest or principal on any investment grade certificate 
the letter of credit may be withdrawn when the ratings of the investment grade certificates are no longer dependent upon the credit support provided by the letter of credit 
during february  one of the mortgage loans in the securitization on a property net leased to winn dixie defaulted  in connection with the bankruptcy of winn dixie 
however  we do not expect any draw on the letter of credit as a result of this mortgage default  or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure substantially all of our assets have exposures to long term interest rate movements  primarily the yields on long term us treasuries 
our hedge and other risk management transactions will also have exposures to movements in interest rates 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect our net income from any investments that we make in net leased real estate  which is the difference between the rental income earned and the interest expense on the liabilities associated with the properties 
changes in the level of interest rates may also affect  among other things  our ability to originate or acquire loans and securities  real estate properties  and the value of our loans and other assets 
credit spread curve exposure our loans and real estate securities are subject to spread risk 
the majority of these assets are fixed rate assets  which are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
in other words  their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such assets by the market based on their credit relative to us treasuries 
changes in the general credit markets can lead to changes in the required yield on these assets  which would result in a higher or lower value for our loans and real estate securities 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these general credit market changes  the value of our fixed rate assets would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of these general credit market changes  the value of our fixed rate assets would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value of our fixed rate asset portfolio may affect the equity on our balance sheet or our results of operations directly through provisions for losses on loans or through unrealized losses on available for sale securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our fixed rate assets 
this would have similar effects on the fair value of our fixed rate assets  our financial position and results of operations  as would a change in general credit spreads 
tenant credit rating exposure our loans and real estate securities are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the tenants under the related net lease obligations 
the credit quality of a particular net lease asset is highly dependent on the credit rating of the related tenant obligor of the net lease 
deterioration in the tenant s credit rating can lead to changes in the required yield on the related asset  which would result in a lower value for our net lease assets 
this would have similar effects on the fair value of our fixed rate assets  our financial position and results of operations  as would a change in general credit spreads 
in addition  precipitous declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term financing may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage this risk by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
we also seek to lock or procure long term financing on our assets as promptly as practicable after we commit to invest 
equity price risk exposure we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
fair value for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate  credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the tenants under related net leases

we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans based on sales of loans with similar credit and structural characteristics where available  and management s estimate of fair values where comparable sales information is not available 
the maturity dates for the loans range from through securities available for sale represent subordinate interests in securitizations cmbs  as well as pass through certificates representing our pro rata investments in a pool of mortgage loans 
structuring fees receivable represent cash flows receivable by us from the sale of loans to third party purchasers 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
fair value for the cmbs is based on third party quotations  where obtainable  or our estimate of fair value  based on yields of comparably rated securities in the cmbs market 
fair value for the structuring fees receivable is shown at our amortized cost for these items 
for the securities available for sale  we receive current monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
these instruments represent hedging and risk management transactions involving interest rate swaps 
they have been valued by reference to market quotations 
our repurchase agreement obligations bear interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes on real estate investments and collateralized debt obligations using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates 
for mortgages where we have an early payment right  we also consider the prepayment amount to evaluate the fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our other long term debt using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates
