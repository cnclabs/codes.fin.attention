item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
due to the company s ability to control the operating partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the unconsolidated properties and certain other entities in which the company has investments  the operating partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the company for financial reporting purposes 
capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  forward looking statements in this item as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current expectations  estimates  projections and assumptions made by management 
while the company s management believes the assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable  such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks  which could cause actual results  performance  or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond management s control 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  results or events 
the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward looking statements because of subsequent events 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the following we intend to actively acquire and develop multifamily properties for rental operations and or conversion into condominiums  as well as upgrade and sell existing properties as individual condominiums 
we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired or condominium conversion property up to standards established for its intended market position or to otherwise develop a property 
additionally  we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts 
this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties or decrease the price at which we expect to sell individual condominiums 
upon conversion of properties to condominiums  we have increased our risk related to construction performed during the conversion 
condominium associations may assert that the construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions 
we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 
we also plan to develop more properties ourselves in addition to co investing with our development partners for either the rental or condominium market  depending on opportunities in each sub market 
this may increase the overall level of risk associated with our developments 
the total number of development units  cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials  competition and local government regulation 
sources of capital to the company or labor and materials required for maintenance  repair  capital expenditure or development are more expensive than anticipated  occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including  without limitation  new construction of multifamily housing  slow employment growth  availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability  all of which are beyond the company s control  and additional factors as discussed in part i of this annual report on form k  particularly those under risk factors 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements  which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
forward looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in note and to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

all building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life 
we expense as incurred all expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life 
for the year ended december   our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately million 
this includes the following detail amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts capitalized improvements to real estate for the year ended december  total units replacements avg

derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december  other minority interests as of december  decreased by million when compared to december  the primary factors that impacted this account in the company s consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended december  were the redemption or repurchase of million shares of series b through f preference interests with a combined liquidation value of million and a premium on redemption of million see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion  distributions declared to minority interests  which amounted to million excluding junior preference unit and preference interest distributions  the allocation of income from operations to holders of op units in the amount of million  the issuance of  op units valued at million at an average price of per unit  and the conversion of million op units into common shares valued at million at an average price of per unit 
total distributions paid in january amounted to million excluding distributions on partially owned properties  which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has co invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company s liquidity  capital resources  credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities 
the nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows institutional ventures during and  the company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner 
at the respective closing dates  the company sold and or contributed properties containing  units to these ventures and retained a ownership interest in the ventures 
the company s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures  which was then distributed to the company 
the company s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets 
other as of december   the company has ownership interests in eleven properties containing  units acquired in a prior merger 
the current weighted average ownership percentage is 
the company s strategy with respect to these interests is either to acquire a majority ownership or sell the company s interest 
as of december   the company has six projects totaling  units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through march  the primary development agreements currently in place have the following key terms the first development partner has the right  at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement  to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the company based on such value 
if the company chooses not to purchase the interest  it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value 
the company s partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property 
in connection with this development agreement  the company has an obligation to provide up to million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing 
as of the date of this filing  the company had no amounts outstanding related to this credit enhancement 
the company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement 
this agreement expires no later than december  notwithstanding the termination of the agreement  the company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred 
the second development partner has the right  at any time following completion of a project subject to the agreement  to require the company to purchase the partners interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price 
if the company and the partner are unable to agree on a price  both parties will obtain appraisals 
if the appraised values vary by more than  both the company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value 
the company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead  authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed upon value to an unrelated third party 
five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property  the company must purchase  at the agreed upon price  any projects remaining unsold 
the third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization  as defined  to market a subject project for sale 
thereafter  either the company or its development partner may market a subject project for sale 
if the company s development partner proposes the sale  the company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project 
if the two appraised values vary by more than  a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property 
once a value has been determined  the company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed upon value 
in addition  the company has various deal specific development agreements with partners  the overall terms of which are similar in nature to those described above 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company s investments in unconsolidated entities 
the company s guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project was terminated effective may  as the tax exempt bonds were redeemed in full and the associated letter of credit was cancelled 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december  payments due by year in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total debt a operating leases minimum rent payments b other long term liabilities deferred compensation c total a amounts include aggregate principal payments only 
the company paid   and  for interest on debt  inclusive of derivative instruments  for the years ended december   and  respectively

c estimated payments to the company s chairman  two former ceo s and its chief operating officer based on planned retirement dates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  and are consistent with the year ended december  the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators of permanent impairment 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life  building improvements over a year to year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs 
expensing of fixed asset repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 
the company follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities  with capitalization ceasing no later than days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property 
the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties  except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 
and sfas no 
and its amendments sfas nos 
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis 
leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year  renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis 
fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 
stock based compensation the company elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendment sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of  which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted 
the company elected the prospective method which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after january  compensation expense under all of the company s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards 
funds from operations for the year ended december   funds from operations ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december   and funds from operations amounts in thousands year ended december  net income allocation to minority interests operating partnership adjustments depreciation depreciation non real estate additions depreciation partially owned and unconsolidated properties net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities discontinued operations depreciation net gain on sales of discontinued operations net incremental gain on sales of condominium units ffo preferred distributions premium on redemption of preferred shares ffo available to common shares and op units the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo april white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company  because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s financial instruments result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving credit facilities 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  other assets  lines of credit  accounts payable and accrued expenses  rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of the company s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes were both approximately billion at december  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately billion  or of total debt at december   net of the effects of any derivative instruments 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
at december   the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately billion  net of the effects of any derivative instruments 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would be approximately billion 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would be approximately billion 
at december   the company s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately billion  or of total debt at december   net of the effects of any derivative instruments

if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
