financial overview as more fully discussed in later sections of this md a  the following were the significant themes and events for year over year revenue growth in data warehousing and an increasing percentage of self service revenue in our retail store automation business were largely offset by an anticipated decline in customer services revenue as the company is reducing lower margin services contracts associated with some third party products 
ncr s improved cost structure and more favorable mix of revenue enabled operating margin improvement on very limited revenue growth 
cash provided by operating activities notably improved year over year 
in  we established three key value drivers in order to improve and measure our overall success 
these drivers and our results against them were as follows driving revenue growth in our key product segments on a combined basis  our product segments  consisting of our teradata data warehousing  financial self service atms and retail store automation systems  experienced revenue growth in compared to the increase was primarily driven by our data warehousing segment  which increased from financial self service was up whereas retail store automation was down 
improving the profitability of our customer services operating segment we are driving operational and financial improvement by lowering our service delivery costs  improving the percentage of ncr atms and pos equipment that is serviced by ncr  and increasing our focus on the linkage between product engineering and product serviceability 
the structural changes to reduce costs and the increasing focus on maintenance of ncr branded products  as along with the improved performance related to third party products  enabled operating income to improve by million year over year 
continuing to reduce spending to achieve optimum operating performance we have continued to make progress in reducing our infrastructure cost in we are firmly on track to deliver million of annualized cost savings through  using as a starting point 
the next phase of our cost reduction actions will target cost of goods sold such as manufacturing costs  supply chain efficiencies  and process improvements  such as our order invoice system 
these improvements may be offset by other factors  such as increased investments and continued price erosion 
please refer to the restructuring and re engineering section in this md a for further details on our cost reductions efforts 

table of contents strategy overview building on the value drivers established in  our strategic initiatives to increase operating income and return maximum value to our stakeholders include increased productivity competitive cost structure our future vision is to deliver the right products in the right geographies at the right time and cost by utilizing state of the art technologies and processes 
the company expects to focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our core functions and the productivity of our employees 
areas of emphasis are expected to include product development  supply chain  customer services delivery and our overall management system 
profitable growth we expect to continue to optimize our investments in demand creation to increase ncr s market coverage in areas with the greatest potential for profitable growth 
we expect these investments to provide benefits in and beyond 
we believe that ncr has growth opportunities in data warehousing  enterprise analytics and self service technologies  such as self check in out and other self service solutions 
we expect to continue to grow our businesses organically as well as through targeted acquisitions and strategic partnerships 
high performance culture to achieve a higher level of performance and growth  the company expects to work in close collaboration with our customers to more efficiently address and anticipate their needs  allowing us to effectively innovate our products  solutions and processes to meet ever changing market demands and customer requirements 
future trends we are projecting that the capital spending environment in will be about the same as what was experienced in  and are forecasting ncr s revenue to be roughly the same as was generated in  including an expected of negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
we expect our operating income to increase due to a more favorable mix of revenue as higher margin data warehousing and self service technologies increase as a percent of the total 
in addition  we expect the continued reduction of our infrastructure costs and the restructuring of our customer services business to positively impact operating income 
we see the following as the most significant risks to the execution of our initiatives global capital spending environment competition and loss of market share executing our customer services transformation process impact of pension expense price erosion further discussion on our risk factors is included under factors that may affect future results of this md a

constant currency is calculated by restating results using monthly average currency rates 
the revenue growth in the americas region was due to higher revenues in data warehousing and financial self service 
in our emea region  moderate growth in many of our businesses was offset by the expected decline in customer services 
in japan  growth from data warehousing and payment imaging and other was more than offset by declines in our other businesses 
finally  in our asia pacific region  revenue declined in nearly all of our businesses 
financial self service revenue was significantly lower in this region as we continue to exercise price discipline in a very price sensitive market 
trends in the asia pacific region are difficult to anticipate due to the cyclical nature and size of transactions 
income from operations increased due to a more favorable mix of revenue coming from data warehousing  lower cost and expense  and improved services margins 
the lower cost and expense more than offset price erosion experienced across all of our major product offerings

table of contents in the americas region  the revenue growth was attributable to strong volumes in our three major product segments of financial self service  data warehousing and retail store automation 
the growth in our emea region was primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates and increased volumes in financial self service  which was offset somewhat by declines in payment imaging and other 
in japan  a volume increase in data warehousing was more than offset by declines in nearly every other segment 
in the asia pacific region  foreign currency changes primarily drove the revenue increase 
certain segments  such as financial self service  retail store automation  systemedia and data warehousing  grew beyond the currency impact in asia pacific  however  this growth was offset by volume declines in other businesses 
income from operations increased primarily due to a combination of higher volumes in our three main product businesses  benefits from foreign currency fluctuations  and lower cost and expense 
the increase in income from operations more than offset the increase in pension and severance expense  the incremental costs associated with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  and cost associated with exiting real estate facilities

data warehousing provides the market leading teradata data warehousing database software  hardware platform  analytic solutions and related services that enable companies to gain a competitive advantage by more quickly and efficiently analyzing a single integrated view of customer  product  supply chain  financial and other business information and then delivering that business intelligence to the company s decision makers 
this segment s revenues are primarily generated in the enterprise data warehousing market  which is part of the larger database market 
our main strategic initiative is to increase our market share in the enterprise data warehouse market and to increase our penetration in the overall data warehousing market 
we plan to meet these goals by providing the technology  support and consulting services that companies need to capitalize on enterprise wide analytics and maximize the usefulness of their existing data 
we will continue to focus on customers that have large amounts and complex data to leverage  which would generate a continued need for enterprise analytics and consulting and potentially lead to future upgrades and expansion 
the following table presents data warehousing including support services revenue and operating income for the years ended december data warehousing in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue data warehousing revenue increased in from revenue increased due to strong demand for enterprise data warehousing 
the strong growth is indicative of customers valuing the superior analytical capabilities of our data warehousing solutions and the return on investment they can provide

table of contents data warehousing revenue increased in from due to an increase in both product sales and support services 
foreign currency fluctuations provided of benefit to the year over year comparison 
the increase in operating income from to reflects the increases in sales and support services 
consistent with our strategy  reductions in infrastructure costs allowed investment in sales and research and development initiatives 
while we have seen fluctuations in the information technology environment in the past  our outlook remains positive  as we expect to see continued growth in versus a very strong our growth in support services and solution revenue should lead to higher operating income versus for this business 
our continued improvement in operating performance in  should be somewhat offset by increased investment for future growth 
financial self service provides atm related technologies including cash dispensers  services and software solutions to financial institutions  retailers and independent deployers 
our financial self service solutions are designed to quickly and reliably process consumer transactions and incorporate advanced features such as the automation of cash and check deposits  bill payment  web enablement and the dispensing of non cash items 
the market demand for financial self service products and services is expected to remain about the same in our strategy is to fully distribute our sales force and invest in emerging markets such as china  india and russia 
also  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of our market leading deposit automation technology and software  which provide higher value solutions 
additionally  we are making progress to create a competitive cost advantage for this business  optimizing our human and asset capital deployment in order to become a lower cost supplier 
this includes streamlining our supply chain and producing atms in the region generating the demand 
evidence of progress toward this goal is the opening of our new atm assembly and distribution facility in budapest  hungary  which will help serve markets in eastern europe 
a significant event in the financial services marketplace is the check clearing for the st century act  or check  which took effect in october the act is intended to improve the efficiency of the us federal reserve s current paper based clearing and settlement system through expedited funds availability and reduced risk associated with paper movement 
the financial self service business should realize benefits from this legislative change over the next several years 
financial institutions in the united states are rebuilding their infrastructure in order to clear and process checks electronically 
as soon as they have these systems ready  ncr expects these financial institutions to upgrade their atms in order to allow checks to be digitally scanned upon deposit at the atm so that they can eliminate the costly and slow process of clearing the paper form of the check 
the following table presents financial self service revenue and operating income for the years ended december financial self service atms in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue for financial self service increased in from foreign currency fluctuations provided less than of benefit to the year over year revenue comparison 
the increase in revenue was the result of strong growth in the americas as financial institutions in the united states continued to upgrade their atms to comply with regulatory changes  which was partially offset by lower revenue in asia pacific due to the adverse timing of transactions and an aggressive pricing environment 
operating income was lower in compared to  as cost and expense reductions were not enough to offset competitive pricing pressure 
revenue for financial self service grew in from the increase was the result of growth in all regions 
in the americas region  we benefited from financial institutions in the united states upgrading their atm networks for regulatory changes 
growth in the emea region was reflective of banks upgrading their atms for the automation of cash deposits  as well as expansion of atm networks in eastern europe 
growth in the asia pacific region was broad based with meaningful growth in several countries 
foreign currency fluctuations provided a benefit of to the year over year revenue comparison 
operating income improved due to increased volume  the favorable movement of foreign currency  and expense reductions  which offset the effects of price erosion 

table of contents in  we expect revenue for financial self service to be roughly the same as in to maintain the profitability of this business  we are focused on properly selling the value of our technology and will continue to reduce our costs by improving the efficiency of our supply chain and leveraging the synergies of our global manufacturing locations 
we expect operating income as a percent of revenue to be roughly in line with the previous year  assuming no change in the pricing environment 
retail store automation provides retail oriented technologies such as pos terminals  bar code scanners and software  as well as innovative products such as our self checkout systems and self service kiosks  to companies worldwide 
combining our retail industry expertise  software and hardware technologies  and implementation and store performance consulting services  our retail store automation solutions are designed to enable cost reductions and improve operational efficiency for companies while increasing the satisfaction of their customers 
ncr provides a highly competitive product offering for retailers in an increasingly commoditized market 
in  the retail store automation business continued to make improvements in lowering its cost structure  and will continue to focus on additional improvements in its operating model in part of our longer term strategy  in addition to lowering our cost structure  includes making investments in new technologies that are projected to increase efficiencies for retailers  such as self service technologies and radio frequency identification rfid systems 
the following table presents retail store automation revenue and operating income for the years ended december retail store automation in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue retail store automation revenue was down compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided less than of negative impact to the year over year revenue comparison 
despite a challenging market  revenues for self service technologies increased year over year  nearly offsetting a decline in revenue from traditional pos terminals 
in  approximately of revenue was from self service technologies  which was partially aided by acquisitions 
the increase in operating income in from was largely due to cost and expense reductions and a favorable mix of products sold 
in  retail store automation revenue grew compared to the revenue growth was attributable to higher pos terminal and bar code scanner volumes  software and professional services  as well as three percentage points of benefit from foreign currency rate changes 
the operating income improvement of million from to was the result of higher volumes mentioned above  cost and expense reductions  and favorable foreign currency fluctuations 
we expect higher revenue for retail store automation solutions due to increasing demand for self service technologies along with expansion of software and services 
we expect about a third of our revenue to come from self service technologies by due to increased revenue anticipated from self service technologies and our continuing actions to reduce cost and expense in this business  we expect operating income to improve in customer services are an essential component of our complete solution offerings 
ncr s customer services division provides maintenance and support services for ncr s products as well as some third party products 
maintenance and support services include site design  staging and implementation  and complete systems management 
we believe that customers value the integration of maintenance and support services with the hardware and software they purchase 
however  heavy competition in the services industry and anticipated revenue declines from businesses we have exited in prior years has led to lower revenues in our customer services business over the past few years 
the exited businesses relate to higher margin maintenance contracts associated with bank branch automation  account processing and low end server hardware we stopped selling several years ago 
we have taken steps to reverse the trend of declining profitability through cost management  such as the realignment of call centers we operate  and through operational efficiencies  such as implementing a call dispatching and productivity tool 

table of contents we have developed a long term services transformation process designed to deliver the operating margins we expect from this business 
for  we will continue to pursue the following operational goals that were set in drive profitable growth related to ncr branded products 
we will continue to support third party products when doing so aligns with our strategic and financial objectives 
increase the linkage between product engineering and the serviceability of our products eg  atms  pos systems 
further reduce infrastructure and service delivery costs 
build diagnostics into our products to improve the remote diagnostics and serviceability of our products 
ensure that ncr intellectual property ip rights are not violated by third parties 
we believe we can be more competitive in the marketplace by concentrating on servicing ncr products rather than on incremental services from third party products 
by proactively designing products for more efficient serviceability  time spent on service incidents will be reduced 
this will help us achieve a lower cost structure by shifting our service model to diagnose incidents remotely and dispatch personnel through a global operating model that takes advantage of personnel and incident location synergies 
also  we will continue to evaluate the number of customer call centers we maintain and modify their operations to enhance our remote diagnostic capabilities 
we believe these changes will lead to increased customer satisfaction through faster service  while reducing our service delivery costs 
unauthorized use of ncr intellectual property allows third party service providers a free ride on ncr s investment in research and development  giving them an unfair price advantage 
ncr s actions to enforce its ip rights and require that third parties properly license diagnostic software are intended to eliminate this free ride 
additionally  ncr continues to monitor and enforce its parts sales agreements to ensure that purchasers comply with program requirements and use parts for their intended purpose 
together  these activities help eliminate unfair cost advantages to third party service providers and generate an appropriate return on ncr s investment for development of its services intellectual property 
the following table presents customer services revenue and operating income loss for the years ended december customer services in millions revenue operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of revenue customer services revenue decreased in compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided less than of benefit to the year over year revenue comparison 
in line with our strategy to improve our revenue mix  revenue was down as we continue to reduce our focus on third party maintenance business 
partially offsetting this decline was growth in maintenance revenue of ncr branded products 
this strategic shift and structural changes being made in the customer services business to optimize the efficiency of resources  mentioned earlier in this section  enabled operating income to significantly improve in compared to results included million of higher severance expense related to actions to improve profitability along with an million charge for the settlement of an agreement entered into in with a services partner 
revenue for customer services decreased in compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided a benefit to year over year revenue comparison 
customer services revenue was impacted by lower revenue from the maintenance and sale of third party products and continued price erosion as competition for services remains strong 
also affecting the year over year comparison was the declining base of high margin revenue associated with businesses we previously exited 
operating income declined due to price erosion and the effect of exited businesses  as well as from actions taken to correct the operating costs for this business 
planned headcount reductions resulted in higher severance related postemployment benefits expense of million in the results also included an million charge for the settlement of an agreement entered into in with a services partner 
customer services segment revenue in is expected to be down compared to as planned declines in third party maintenance contracts and price erosion continue to offset gains in maintenance revenue of ncr branded products 
however  due to an improving mix of revenue and the cost actions mentioned above  operating income in is expected to increase compared to systemedia provides printer consumables and products including paper rolls for atms and pos workstations  inkjet and laser printer supplies  thermal transfer ribbons  labels  ink ribbons  laser documents  business forms and retail office products 
systemedia products are designed to reduce paper related failures in our atms and pos terminals and enable businesses to improve transaction accuracy while reducing overall costs 

table of contents the printer consumables market is highly fragmented  and market consolidation continues due to lower levels of demand in traditional media products such as paper rolls  fax paper  ink ribbons and forms 
to compete effectively in this market  we are working to drive cost out of our supply chain 
this includes sourcing raw material and finished products from low cost regions  reducing distribution costs  automating manufacturing to reduce labor and consolidating production wherever possible 
future growth is expected to come from new products such as rfid labels and two sided thermal paper 
two sided thermal printing is a new printing technology that enables customers to simultaneously print on the front and back of customer receipts 
the following table presents systemedia revenue and operating income for the years ended december systemedia in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue for systemedia was down in compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided less than of benefit to the year over year revenue comparison 
the decline in revenue was mainly attributable to competitive pricing pressure experienced in all regions where we operate 
operating income decreased in compared to manufacturing cost and expense reductions were more than offset by the increase in product cost and impact of competitive pricing pressure 
revenue for systemedia increased in from excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations  revenue was unchanged 
growth in the americas and asia pacific regions was offset by declines in the emea region and japan 
the decrease in operating income from was due to competition for traditional media products  which affects both pricing and volumes 
cost and expense reductions were somewhat offset by significant increases in paper prices  which represents the largest percentage of product cost for this business 
we expect revenue to be down in versus we anticipate strong competition  especially in our mature product offerings  more than offsetting growth in new products 
we believe that operating income will improve in due to our actions to reduce cost of goods sold 
payment imaging and other provide end to end solutions for both traditional paper based and image based check and item processing 
our imaging solutions utilize advanced image recognition and workflow technologies to automate item processing  helping financial institutions increase efficiency and reduce operating costs 
consisting of hardware  software  and consulting and support services  our comprehensive payment imaging solutions enable check and item based transactions to be digitally scanned  processed and retained within a flexible  scalable environment 
other business included in this segment primarily relates to a business in japan 
the most significant event that has occurred in the check payment and imaging marketplace in recent years was check  which took effect in october of the act is intended to improve the efficiency of the us federal reserve s current paper based clearing and settlement system through expedited funds availability and reduced risk associated with paper movement 
although we offer image based solutions and services  as the need for digital imaging increases  the reliance on products that were designed for paper based processing will decrease 
revenue growth in this segment will be challenging given these market dynamics 
the following table presents payment imaging and other revenue and operating income for the years ended december payment imaging and other in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue 
table of contents revenue for this segment decreased compared to foreign currency fluctuations had a negative impact on the year over year revenue comparison 
the operating income improvement in compared to was mainly driven by continued cost and expense reductions 
revenue was down compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided a benefit to the year over year revenue comparison 
operating income decreased in due to the volume decline and the continued shift in our revenue base from higher margin traditional processing equipment to lower margin imaging solutions as a result of the regulatory changes mentioned above 
as financial institutions continue to comply with check and invest in their check processing infrastructure  we expect a shift to digital imaging products from traditional paper processing systems 
the impact of this shift is anticipated to result in lower revenue for and lower operating income for this business due to the high margins associated with traditional check processing equipment 
restructuring and re engineering during  we continued with our re engineering plans announced in to drive operational efficiency throughout our company 
we are targeting process improvements to drive simplification  standardization  globalization and consistency across the organization 
we continued to eliminate unnecessary costs and expenses from our business 
as a result  we are firmly on track to delivering million of annualized cost savings through  using as a starting point 
in addition to the activities described above in our businesses  we have made changes in our infrastructure to bring our costs in line with industry benchmarks 
regarding ncr s internal information technology  we have replaced or will continue to replace most major company applications  migrating from country centric applications to new enterprise applications such as our enterprise resource planning erp system  our global human resources system and our teradata enterprise data warehouse 
in our human resources organization  we have improved efficiencies and reduced costs by centralizing our staffing organization and controlling our external recruitment expenses 
in our finance and administration area  we reorganized and reduced our workforce to a lower cost structure 
in  ncr entered into a service agreement with accenture llp accenture  a global outsourcing services provider  under which many of ncr s key transaction processing activities  including overall and day to day responsibility for order and revenue processing  accounts receivable  accounts payable and the company s general ledger function  are performed by accenture 
because of this transition  ncr s transaction processing activities are better streamlined and standardized resulting in improved efficiency and consistency of practices globally 
as a result  we have significantly reduced our overall finance and administration costs and improved the use of global and regional centers for transaction processing 
to further improve profitability in customer services  ncr offered an early retirement program to qualified customer service engineers in the united states 
as a result of participant election  the company recorded a non cash increase in pension expense during the second quarter of of million 
this initiative should result in annual cost savings of approximately million in as part of our continued actions to improve profitability in customer services  we expect to offer a second early retirement program to qualified customer service engineers in the first quarter of depending on the level of participation in this program  the company could see up to a million  non cash charge to pension expense in the first quarter of assuming that of those eligible do participate  we would incur approximately million of additional non cash pension expense in the first quarter of this initiative should result in annual cost savings of to million  beginning in late another element of the re engineering is our real estate consolidation and restructuring plan 
during  we reduced our number of properties by  representing a reduction in total properties from although the reduction in number of properties may be lower in future periods as compared to  we will continue to examine our portfolio of owned and leased properties in order to lower our overall facility costs 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with announced restructuring efforts  ncr s management approved a real estate consolidation and restructuring plan designed to accelerate the company s re engineering strategies 
a pre tax restructuring charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  to provide for contractual lease termination costs 
the balance of this recorded liability at december  was million 
the company reviews this reserve on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve is adequate based on current market conditions 
in the third quarter of  based on our quarterly assessment  the reserve was increased by million 
the increase was taken to account for changes in the estimates of the anticipated vacant periods  free rent and loss on subleases based on current market conditions 
during  the company utilized million of the reserve 
the remaining lease obligations will expire over various dates through the remaining balance of this recorded liability on december  was million 

table of contents effects of pension  postemployment and postretirement benefit plans ncr s cost and expense for the years ended december was impacted by certain employee benefit plans as shown below in millions pension expense postemployment expense postretirement expense total expense we recorded million of pension expense in versus million of pension expense in this increase was due primarily to million of non cash special termination benefits recognized in the second quarter of that were related to the early retirement program described in more detail in the restructuring and re engineering section of this md a 
pension expense also increased million in relative to due primarily to the changes in discount rates and the impact of the investment performance of our pension fund portfolio in the difficult market environments during through also during  we made changes to our us defined benefit pension plans in order to limit participation only to employees who were at least years old and hired by august  as of september   the plans were closed to new participants 
we expect pension expense of approximately million in excluding the impact of any non cash charge that may arise from the early retirement program currently being offered to certain customer services engineers located in the us this is discussed in more detail in the restructuring and re engineering section of this md a 
in  global capital market developments resulted in a decline in the discount rates used to estimate the pension liability 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation of certain pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets for those pension plans  and ncr was required to adjust the minimum liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
this million charge decreased prepaid pension costs by million  increased pension liabilities by million  increased deferred taxes by million  and increased other comprehensive loss by million 
this non cash charge did not affect our earnings  cash flow or debt covenants  nor did it otherwise impact the business operations of the company 
postemployment expense severance and disability medical decreased to million in  versus million in this decrease was driven primarily by changes in the severance benefit formulas in a number of countries 
postemployment expense increased million in relative to this increase in expense was mainly due to an expected higher level of involuntary turnover  primarily driven by the company s infrastructure cost reduction initiatives  as well as lower discount rates in many countries in postretirement plan expense medical in was unchanged at million in this expense decreased to million in from million in primarily due to the elimination of the us postretirement life insurance benefit  and increases in retiree cost sharing announced in in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of became law in the united states 
this new law will not have any material impact on ncr s postretirement plan liabilities or expense as the company does not provide prescription drug benefits to its medicare eligible retirees 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue for increased to from in both services gross margin and product gross margin increased year over year 
product gross margin increased slightly to in from in improved mix of products sold along with cost reductions helped to reduce the impact of competitive pricing pressure 
services gross margin improved to in compared to in services gross margin increased due to the structural changes being made in the customer services business to optimize the efficiency of resources  as well as to increase the focus on maintenance of ncr branded products 
in  gross margin as a percentage of total revenue declined to from in both product and services gross margins were down versus the prior year 
most of the decline was due to million of higher pension cost recorded in cost of sales in compared to additionally  price erosion had an adverse effect on gross margin 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses  characterized as selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  were  million in compared to  million in as a percentage of revenue  total operating expenses for improved to from in the decrease is the result of our continued efforts to improve our cost infrastructure and curtail our discretionary spending while reallocating some of these resources to demand creation and research and development activities for our three major product businesses 
operating expenses decreased to  million in versus  million in lower expenses were directly related to the reduction of our infrastructure expenditures 
the reduction in these areas was partially offset by the increased investment in sales and demand creation in our data warehousing and financial self service segments  research and development  and million more of pension expense 
in  we plan to continue reducing our infrastructure costs as compared to a larger portion of our cost savings will be reinvested to improve demand generation capabilities 
we are committed to new product development and will focus on achieving maximum yield from our research and development spending and resources 
interest and other expense and income items interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in from was driven by lower interest rates from an interest rate swap and by the elimination of certain borrowings against company owned life insurance policies 
in november  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted million of the debt to a variable rate 
although this variable rate was in line with the fixed rate as of december   changes in the interest rate markets could raise the variable rate of the swap above the fixed rate of the debt  which would lead to higher expenses and cash outflows 
other income and expense  net  was million of income in  million of income in and million of expense in included million of expense from the write down of an equity investment in germany  million in real estate gains and million of expense for funding to ncr s foundation for charitable giving 
included million of real estate gains  million related to receipt of an acquisition break up fee  million for recovery of a non trade receivable that was previously fully reserved and a million release of a reserve for exit of certain countries in the middle east and africa region 
in  due to the reassessment of the accrual for the potential future liability related to the fox river environmental matter  we recorded million in other expense 
the risks and uncertainties associated with this matter are discussed in the environmental and legal contingencies section of the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this md a and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the income tax benefit was million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in the income tax benefit in included benefits of million that were related to the successful resolution of prior year tax audits and million of benefits from an adjustment to the company s tax accounts in the united kingdom 
the tax benefit in included an million benefit resulting from a favorable settlement of tax audit items relating to the period when ncr was a subsidiary of at t 
the income tax expense in included million for an increase to the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets of ncr s japanese subsidiaries 
including million of tax benefits from the resolution of tax audits and the million of benefits from an adjustment to the company s tax accounts in the united kingdom  our income tax rate for was approximately 
our effective operating tax rate was 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by profit generated in several foreign countries that have lower effective tax rates due to prior year losses 
including the million of tax benefits  our income tax rate for was approximately 
our effective operating tax rate was 
our income tax rate for was approximately  and included the impact of the reserve taken for the fox river environmental matter and income related to the lucent indemnification claim 
these items provided a percentage point benefit to the income tax rate for each year  our effective tax rate includes a certain amount of benefit related to the use of foreign tax credits 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately in however  changes in profit mix or other events  such as tax audit settlements  could change this rate 
the internal revenue service irs has completed its examination of the income tax returns  excluding amendments  of ncr for all years through as of december   the irs was in the process of examining ncr s income tax returns for years and in addition  ncr is subject to numerous ongoing audits by state and foreign authorities 
while ncr believes that it is appropriately reserved for any outstanding issues of these audits  should these audits be settled  the resulting tax effect could impact the tax provision in future periods 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources to assess the financial performance of the company  ncr s management uses a non gaap measure called free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  reworkable service parts  and additions to capitalized software 
the components that are used to calculate free cash flow are gaap measures that are taken directly from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe free cash flow information is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations 
in particular  free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for  among other things  investments in the company s existing businesses  strategic acquisitions  repurchase of ncr stock and repayment of debt obligations 
this non gaap measure should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  cash flows from operating activities under gaap 
the table below shows the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures for the following years in millions net cash provided by operating activities less net expenditures and proceeds for service parts expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions to capitalized software free cash flow for  cash provided by operating activities increased by million  while capital expenditures decreased by million  resulting in a net increase in free cash flow of million compared to cash from operating activities was higher largely due to improved net income adjusted for non cash items 
the increase in our net income in as compared to was due to a more favorable mix of revenue coming from data warehousing  lower cost and expense  and improved services margins 
the net changes in asset and liability balances had a minimal impact on operating cash flow in operating cash flow was favorably impacted by increases of million in customer deposits and deferred service revenue 
the increase in customer deposits and deferred service revenue balance was mainly due to a higher volume of customer deposits in certain geographies 
in addition  the cash outflows related to employee severance  pension and postretirement were less than the amount of expense for these items  resulting in a million favorable impact to cash flow 
partially offsetting these items were negative cash flow impacts from net decreases in current payables largely payroll liabilities of million and other liabilities of million driven largely by timing of payments 
in  our capital expenditures decreased to million from million in we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
we expect net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  otherwise defined as free cash flow  to be about to million in financing activities and certain other investing activities are not included in our calculation of free cash flow 
these other investing activities included net proceeds of million from the sale of real estate and million of cash used for mainly acquisition related activity 
our financing activities in mainly consisted of cash outflows from our share repurchase activities and cash inflows from the issuance of shares through our employee stock plans 
during  we purchased million shares of ncr common stock for million as compared to million shares purchased for million in shares for and reflect the impact of a two for one stock split effective january  cash inflows from stock plans were million in compared to million in  the decrease was driven by a decline in the number of options exercised by employees 
the net impact of our share purchases and issuances in was a reduction of million shares outstanding as compared to the share purchases are part of a systematic purchase program authorized by ncr s board of directors 
we will continue this program in  however  the amount of stock purchases may vary from past years depending on several factors  including the amount of exercises of stock compensation awards and employee stock purchase plan activity 

table of contents contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that impact  or could impact  the liquidity of our operations 
the following table and discussion outlines our material obligations at december   with projected cash payments in the years shown in millions total amounts and thereafter debt obligations lease obligations purchase obligations total debt  lease and purchase obligations as of december   we have short and long term debt totaling million  of which a significant portion is from our senior unsecured notes due in as previously discussed  million of the notes were converted to a variable rate in november through an interest rate swap agreement 
interest payments for the debt are payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december  and contain certain covenants typical of this type of debt instrument 
our lease obligations are primarily for certain sales and manufacturing facilities in various domestic and international locations 
purchase obligations represent committed purchase orders and other contractual commitments for goods or services 
the purchase obligation amounts were determined through information in our procurement systems and payment schedules for significant contracts 
included in the amounts are committed payments in relation to the long term service agreement with accenture 
we have short and long term liabilities in relation to the fox river environmental matter that may require future cash payments 
we also have product warranties and several guarantees to third parties that may affect future cash flow 
these commitments and contingencies are not included in the table of obligations shown above  and are described in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our us and international employee benefit plans  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  could require significant future cash payments 
the unfunded status of ncr s us retirement plans increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable to an increase in benefit obligations resulting from the reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future pension liabilities and the use of updated mortality tables  which was partially offset by a better than estimated return on pension assets 
the unfunded status of our international retirement plans decreased from million to million 
asset returns  company contributions and foreign currency translation adjustments contributed positively  but were partially offset by increases in our benefit obligations due to reductions in our discount rate assumptions and additional benefit accruals 
the company did not make any contributions to its us qualified pension plan in  and we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in several legislative changes were recently proposed that would impact our us pension plans  if adopted 
these proposals would alter the manner in which liabilities and asset values are determined for the purpose of calculating required pension contributions and the timing and manner in which required contributions to under funded pension plans would be made 
the proposals are being discussed and debated  however  many details need to be specified  and the proposals then would have to be approved by the us congress 
the funding requirements for our us pension plan could be significantly affected by these proposed changes  if they are adopted 
contributions to international and executive pension plans are expected to increase from million in to approximately million in in october  the company replaced a million day unsecured credit facility with a million five year unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions 
in addition to the million facility  the company has a million  five year unsecured revolving credit facility that the company entered into in october the credit facilities contain certain representations and warranties  conditions  affirmative  negative and financial covenants  and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities are based on prevailing market rates 
no amounts were outstanding under the facilities at december  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as of december  we believe our cash flows from operations  the credit facilities existing or future arrangements  and other short and long term debt financing  will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other business and risk factors described below in factors that may affect future results 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities and senior notes  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or seek additional financing alternatives 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
please see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees associated with ncr s business activities 
factors that may affect future results this report and other documents that we file with the us securities and exchange commission sec  as well as other oral or written statements we may make from time to time  contain information based on management s beliefs and include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and there are a number of factors including  but not limited to  those listed below  that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
economic pressures our business is affected by the global economies in which we operate 
the current economic climate  which includes decreased and or more closely scrutinized capital spending by many industries  could impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers  the ability of our suppliers to meet their commitments to us  the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers  or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us on a timely basis 
the extent of this impact  if any  is dependent on a number of factors  including the duration of the current economic climate  its effect on the markets and other general economic and business conditions 
competition our ability to compete effectively within the technology industry is critical to our future success 
we operate in the intensely competitive information technology industry 
this industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  price and cost reductions  and increasingly greater commoditization of products  making differentiation difficult 
our competitors include other large companies in the technology industry such as international business machines  inc  oracle corporation  diebold  inc  wincor nixdorf gmbh co  getronics nv  fujitsu  and unisys corporation  some of which have widespread distribution and penetration of their platforms and service offerings 
in addition  we compete with companies in specific markets such as entry level atms  payment and imaging  and business consumables and media products 
our future competitive performance and market position depend on a number of factors  including our ability to react to competitive product and pricing pressures particularly in the atm marketplace  penetrate and meet the changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets  such as india and china in the atm business  rapidly and continually design  develop and market  or otherwise maintain and introduce solutions and related products and services for our customers that are competitive in the marketplace  react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands  compete in reverse auctions for new and continuing business  take advantage of data warehousing market demands  reduce costs without creating operating inefficiencies  maintain competitive operating margins  improve product and service delivery quality  and effectively market and sell all of our diverse solutions 
our business and operating performance could be impacted by external competitive pressures  such as increasing price erosion and the addition of new competitors 
our customers sometimes finance our product sales through third party financing companies 
in case of customer default  these financing companies may be forced to resell this equipment at discounted prices impacting our ability to sell incremental units 
the impact of these product and pricing pressures could include lower customer satisfaction  decreased demand for our solutions  loss of market share and reduction of operating profits 
operating result fluctuations our revenue and operating results could fluctuate for a number of reasons  including seasonality our sales are historically seasonal  with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year 
such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter 
table of contents depending on the variability in the volume  timing and mix of product sales 
in addition  revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months 
these factors  among other things  make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately 
foreign currency our revenue and operating income are subject to variability due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar 
we have exposure to approximately functional currencies  in which our primary exposure is from fluctuations in the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are sometimes offset by strengths in others 
although the foreign currency environment is difficult to predict  the effects of currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by our hedging strategy 
cost expense reductions we are actively working to reduce our costs and expenses to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the efficiencies of our operations 
our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends on a number of factors  including our ability to achieve infrastructure rationalizations  drive lower component costs  improve supply chain efficiencies  and optimize the efficiency of our customer services resources  among other things 
if we do not successfully complete our cost reduction initiatives  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
contractual obligations of consulting services we maintain a professional services consulting workforce to fulfill contracts that we enter into with our customers that may extend to multiple periods 
our profitability is largely a function of performing to customer contractual arrangements within the estimated costs to perform these obligations 
if we exceed these estimated costs  our profitability related to these contracts may be negatively impacted 
in addition  if we are unable to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our consultants  we may not be able to sustain profitability on these contracts 
acquisitions and divestitures as part of our strategy  we intend to selectively acquire and divest technologies  products and businesses 
as these acquisitions and divestitures take place and we begin to include  or exclude as the case may be  the financial results related to these transactions  it could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
pension funds consistent with local competitive practice and regulations  we sponsor pension plans in many of the countries where we do business 
a number of these pension plans are supported by pension fund investments that are subject to financial market risk 
the liabilities  assets and costs of these plans are reported in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer s accounting for pensions 
in conforming to the requirements of sfas  we are required to make a number of actuarial assumptions for each plan  including expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate 
our future financial results could be materially impacted by volatility in financial market performance  changes in regulations regarding funding requirements  and changes in the actuarial assumptions  including those described in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
consistent with the requirements of paragraphs of sfas  we estimate our discount rate and long term expected rate of return on asset assumptions on a country by country basis after consultation with independent actuarial consultants 
we examine interest rate levels and trends within each country  particularly yields on high quality long term corporate bonds  relative to our expected future benefit payments to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our long term expected rate of return on asset assumptions are developed by considering the asset allocation and implementation strategies employed by each pension fund relative to capital market expectations 
many countries around the world are in the process of updating their laws and regulations regarding pension funding  including the united states 
these initiatives could require the company to make significantly larger contributions to its pension plans in future years and increase the volatility of these contribution requirements 
stock option accounting similar to other companies  we use stock options as a form of compensation for certain employees 
currently  the expense of these stock options is not reflected in our operating results under accounting guidance from accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
the company will adopt sfas r beginning january  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the amount recognized for stock compensation could vary depending on a number of assumptions or changes 
for example  assumptions such as risk free rate and expected volatility that drive our valuation model could change 
other examples that could have an impact include changes in the mix and type of awards  changes in our compensation plans or tax rate  or an unusually high amount of expirations of stock options 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred 
table of contents tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
real estate our strategy over the past several years with respect to owned and leased real estate has been to reduce our holdings of excess real estate 
in line with this strategy  we anticipate the exit of facilities  which may affect net income 
adverse real estate markets could impede our ability to reduce the size of our real estate portfolio 
multinational operations generating substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps to balance our risks and meet our strategic goals 
in  the percentage of revenues from outside of the united states was 
we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations eg  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and deteriorating economic environments or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties 
however  our ability to sell our solutions domestically in the united states and internationally is subject to the following risks  among others general economic and political conditions in each country that could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets  currency exchange rate fluctuations that could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses  changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations that may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets  changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets  and the impact of civil unrest relating to war and terrorist activity on the economy or markets in general  or on our ability  or that of our suppliers  to meet commitments 
introduction of new solutions the solutions we sell are very complex  and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions in a competitive  rapidly changing environment 
the development process for our solutions  including our software application development programs and the migration of our teradata data warehousing solution to the latest software and hardware platforms  requires high levels of innovation from both our software developers and our suppliers of the components embedded in our solutions 
in addition  the development process can be lengthy and costly  and requires us to commit a significant amount of resources to bring our business solutions to market 
if we are unable to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately  or are otherwise unable to complete development efficiently  we would be unable to introduce new solutions into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results could be impacted 
likewise  we sometimes make assurances to customers regarding new technologies  and our results could be impacted if we are unable to deliver such technologies as planned 
also  if we cannot successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions  our business and operating results could be impacted 
our hardware and software based solutions may contain known  as well as undetected errors  which may be found after the products introduction and shipment 
while we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment  we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors  and this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance and incremental costs  which would all impact our business and operating results 
reliance on third parties third party suppliers provide important elements to our solutions 
in most cases  there are a number of vendors providing the services and producing the parts and components that we utilize 
however  there are some components that are purchased from single sources due to price  quality  technology or other reasons 
for example  we depend on transaction processing services from accenture  silicon computer chips and microprocessors from intel corporation  and operating systems from microsoft corporation 
certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our atms and the delivery of many of our retail store automation solutions are also supplied by single sources 
in addition  there are a number of key suppliers for our businesses who provide us with critical products for our solutions 
if we were unable to purchase the necessary services  parts  components or products from a particular vendor and we had to find an alternative supplier  our new and existing product shipments and solutions deliveries could be delayed  impacting our business and operating results 
we have  from time to time  formed alliances with third parties that have complementary products  software  services and skills 
many different relationships are formed by these alliances  such as outsourcing arrangements to manufacture hardware and subcontract agreements with third parties to perform services and provide products and software to our customers in connection with our solutions 
for example  we rely on third parties for cash replenishment services for our atm products 

table of contents also  some of these third parties have access to confidential ncr and customer data  the integrity and security of which we need to ensure 
these alliances introduce risks that we cannot control  such as nonperformance by third parties and difficulties with or delays in integrating elements provided by third parties into our solutions 
lack of information technology infrastructure  shortages in business capitalization  manual processes and data integrity issues of smaller suppliers can also create product time delays  inventory and invoicing problems  and staging delays  as well as other operating issues 
the failure of third parties to provide high quality products or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements could impair the delivery of our solutions on a timely basis  create exposure for non compliance with our contractual commitments to our customers and impact our business and operating results 
intellectual property as a technology company  our intellectual property portfolio is key to our continuing ability to be a leading technology and services solutions provider 
to that end  it is critical that we continue to develop leading technologies to protect and enhance our proprietary rights in our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
these efforts include protection of the products and application  diagnostic and other software we develop 
to the extent we are not successful  our business could be adversely impacted 
also  many of our offerings rely on technologies developed by others  and if we are unable to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies  our business would be impacted 
there has been a recent increase in the issuance of software and business method patents  and more companies are aggressively enforcing their intellectual property rights 
this trend could impact ncr because  from time to time  we receive notices from third parties regarding patent and other intellectual property claims 
whether such claims are with or without merit  they may require significant resources to defend 
if an infringement claim is successful  in the event we are unable to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business could be adversely affected 
work environment restructuring and re engineering as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure  from time to time  we shift and realign our employee resources  which could temporarily result in substandard productivity levels 
in addition to reducing costs and expenses  our plan includes initiatives to grow revenue  such as improving sales training  addressing sales territory requirements  maintaining and monitoring customer satisfaction with our solutions  and focusing on our strong value propositions 
we currently have many initiatives underway 
if we are not successful in managing these initiatives and minimizing any resulting loss in productivity  our business and operating results could be impacted 
employees our employees are vital to our success 
our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting and other key personnel is critical  as these key employees are difficult to replace 
our current re engineering efforts may adversely impact our workforce 
if we are unable to attract or retain highly qualified employees by offering competitive compensation  secure work environments and leadership opportunities now and in the future  our business and operating results could be impacted 
internal controls accounting policies and practices our internal controls  accounting policies and practices  and internal information systems enable us to capture and process transactions in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  laws and regulations  taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations 
our internal controls and policies are being closely monitored by management as we implement a worldwide erp system and complete the transition of our transaction support functions to accenture 
while we believe these controls  policies  practices and systems are adequate to ensure data integrity  unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees both domestic and international  temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight  or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could impact our financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  while management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  as set forth in report of management included later in this annual report  due to their inherent limitations  such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial statements 
such limitations include  among other things  the potential for human error or circumvention of controls 
further  the company s internal control over financial reporting is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of a failure to remediate control deficiencies  changes in conditions or a deterioration of the degree of compliance with established policies and procedures 
information systems it is periodically necessary to replace  upgrade or modify our internal information systems 
if we are unable to replace  upgrade or modify such systems in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in light of demands on our information technology resources  our ability to capture and process financial transactions and therefore our financial condition or results of operations may be impacted 

table of contents acquisitions and alliances our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or effectively manage alliance activities will help drive future growth 
as part of our overall solutions strategy  we intend to make investments in companies  products  services and technologies  either through acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve risks 
the risks we may encounter include those associated with assimilating and integrating different business operations  corporate cultures  personnel  infrastructures and technologies or products acquired or licensed  and the potential for unknown liabilities within the acquired or combined business 
the investment or alliance may also disrupt our ongoing business  or we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired products  services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality 
further  we may not achieve the projected synergies once we have integrated the business into our operations 
this may lead to additional costs not anticipated at the time of acquisition 
environmental our historical and ongoing manufacturing activities subject us to environmental exposures 
our facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws  and we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at a number of facilities that we currently own or operate  or formerly owned or operated  to comply  or to determine compliance  with such laws 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as a result of the directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive  our product distribution  logistics and waste management costs may increase and may adversely impact our financial condition 
given the uncertainties inherent in such activities  there can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not impact future operating results 
we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with certain environmental matters  including the fox river matter  as further described in environmental matters under note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  and in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this md a  and we incorporate such disclosures by reference and make them a part of this risk factor 
as described in more detail in such disclosures  we maintain an accrual for our potential liability relating to the fox river matter that represents certain critical estimates and judgments made by us regarding our potential liability  however  both the ultimate costs associated with the fox river matter and our share of those costs are subject to a wide range of potential outcomes 
contingencies like other technology companies  we face uncertainties with regard to regulations  lawsuits and other related matters 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including those that relate to the environment  health and safety  employee benefits  export compliance  intellectual property and other regulatory compliance and general matters 
because such matters are subject to many uncertainties  their outcomes are not predictable 
while we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results 
additionally  we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations  including those relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and reporting  which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future 
although we do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations  rapid changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  and federal securities laws and regulations  among others  may substantially increase costs to our organization and could have an impact on our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
our critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances 
our management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the significant accounting policies and estimates that 
table of contents we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition consistent with other companies that provide similar solution offerings that include hardware  software  professional consulting and support services  revenue recognition is often complex and subject to multiple accounting pronouncements 
these include statement of position  software revenue recognition  staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force no 
issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
we consider revenue realized  or realizable  and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 
revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements requires a greater degree of judgment  including a review of specific contracts  past experience  creditworthiness of customers  international laws and other factors 
changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
we establish provisions for doubtful accounts using percentages of our accounts receivable balances as an overall proxy to reflect historical average credit losses and provision for known issues 
these percentages are applied to aged accounts receivable balances 
aged accounts are determined based on the number of days the receivable is outstanding  measured from the date of the invoice  or from the date of revenue recognition 
as the age of the receivable increases  the provision percentage also increases 
this policy is applied to all of our operating segments 
based on the factors below  we periodically review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
factors include economic conditions and judgments regarding collectibility of account balances  each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december was million in  million in  and million in these allowances represent as a percent of gross receivables in  in and in although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance percentages could materially impact overall financial results 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to default on its obligations  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we may increase our reserves for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
each quarter  our business segments reassess raw materials  work in process  parts and finished equipment inventory costs for purchase or usage variances from standards  and valuation adjustments are made 
additionally  to properly provide for potential exposure due to slow moving  excess  obsolete or unusable inventory  a reserve against inventory is established 
this reserve is established based on forecasted usage  orders  technological obsolescence and inventory aging 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  we review the current market value of inventory and require each business segment to ensure that inventory balances are adjusted for any inventory exposure due to age or excess of cost over market value 
we have inventory in more than countries around the world 
we transfer inventory from our plants to our distribution and sales organizations 
this inventory is transferred at cost plus mark up 
this mark up is referred to as inter company profit 
each quarter we review our inventory levels and analyze our inter company profit for each of our segments to determine the amount of inter company profit to eliminate 
key assumptions are made to estimate product gross margins  the product mix of existing inventory balances and current period shipments 
over time  we refine these estimates as facts and circumstances change 
if our estimates require refinement  our results could be impacted 
our excess and obsolete reserves for inventory were million in  million in and million in these reserves represent as a percent of gross inventory in  in and in although we strive to 
table of contents achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory obsolescence or excess quantities caused by these factors  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional reserves may be needed 
any changes in reserves will impact operating income during a given period 
this policy is consistently applied to all of our operating segments and we do not anticipate any changes to our policy in the near term 
warranty reserves one of our key objectives is to provide superior quality products and services 
to that end  we provide a standard manufacturer s warranty extending up to months such that  should products under warranty require repair  no additional cost of that repair will be charged to our customers 
a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs is also recorded at the time of the sale 
we sometimes offer extended warranties to our customers for purchase 
we defer the fair value of these revenues and recognize revenue over the life of the warranty 
future warranty obligation costs are based upon historic factors such as labor rates  average repair time  travel time  number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts 
each segment consummating a sale recognizes the total customer revenue and records the associated warranty liability based upon an estimated cost to provide the service over the warranty period 
total warranty costs were million in  million in and million in warranty costs as a percent of total product revenues were in  in and in historically  the principal factor used to estimate our warranty costs has been service calls per machine 
significant changes in this factor could result in actual warranty costs differing from accrued estimates 
although no near term changes in our estimated warranty reserves are currently anticipated  in the unlikely event of a significant increase in warranty claims by one or more of our larger customers  costs to fulfill warranty obligations would be higher than provisioned  thereby impacting results 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
our postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and our postemployment plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
we have significant pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit costs and credits  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  rate of increase in health care costs  total and involuntary turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations 
we generally review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension  postretirement or postemployment benefits expense we have recorded or may record 
postretirement and postemployment expenses impact all of our segments  while pension expense is reported at the corporate level 
the key assumptions used in developing our pension and postretirement plan expense were discount rates of and  respectively  and expected return on assets assumption of for our us plans  which represent and of pension and postretirement plan obligations  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a change in the discount rate used for the us plans would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million million in pension expense and million in postretirement expense 
likewise  a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the us pension plan would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million 
our expected return on plan assets has historically been and will likely continue to be material to net income 
while it is required that we review our actuarial assumptions each year at the measurement date  we generally do not change them between measurement dates 
we use a measurement date of december for all of our plans 
in determining pension and postretirement expense for the us plans  we intend to use discount rates of and  respectively  and an expected rate of return on assets assumption of 
the most significant assumption used in developing our postemployment plan expense was the assumed rate of involuntary turnover of 
the involuntary turnover rate is based on historical trends and projections of involuntary turnover in the future 
a change in the rate of involuntary turnover would have increased or decreased pre tax expense by approximately million 
the sensitivity of the assumptions described above is specific to each individual plan and not to our pension  postretirement and postemployment plans in the aggregate 

table of contents mortality assumptions were updated as of december  for our us pension plan to a newer mortality table that better reflects our employees demographic base 
this resulted in an increase in our pension obligation of approximately million 
additionally  this change is expected to increase pension expense by approximately million 
environmental and legal contingencies each quarter  we review the status of each claim and legal proceeding and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally likely outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue for the low end of the range 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and external factors beyond our control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
except for the sharing agreement with appleton papers inc api described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  with respect to the fox river matter note  when insurance carriers or third parties have agreed to pay any amounts related to costs  and we believe that it is probable that we can collect such amounts  those amounts would be reflected as receivables in our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant legal contingency impacting our company relates to the fox river matter  which is further described in detail in note this matter impacts our company overall and does not affect the financial results of any one of its segments 
as described in note  ncr was identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the fox river site in wisconsin because of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb discharges from two carbonless paper manufacturing facilities previously owned by ncr located along the fox river 
our reserve for the fox river matter was revised as of december   and it is now approximately million after taking into consideration amounts expected to be recovered under an indemnity agreement and insurance settlement agreements  discussed in note 
the considerations we took into account in revising our reserve are set forth in note the company regularly re evaluates the assumptions used in determining the appropriate reserve for the fox river matter as additional information becomes available and  when warranted  makes appropriate adjustments 
as described below and in note  while progress has been made in the engineering design of the fox river clean up  the extent of our potential liability continues to be subject to significant uncertainties  including the amount of dredging that will be required by the us environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources the governments  how contaminated sediments will be managed  the accuracy of existing cost estimates  and the extent of ncr s eventual liability 
in setting our reserve  we attempt to estimate a range of reasonably possible outcomes for relevant factors  although each range is itself highly uncertain 
we use our best estimate within the range if that is possible 
where there is a range of equally likely outcomes  and there is no amount within that range that appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we use the low end of the range 
our eventual liability  which we expect will be paid out over a period of at least ten to twenty years  will depend on a number of factors  the most significant of which include the total clean up costs for the site we now use the best estimate within a range of reasonably possible outcomes million which consists of the current estimate of the lower river clean up developed by the engineering firms working on the design  the projected costs of the upper river clean up  plus a contingency for both  the total natural resource damages for the site we now use the best estimate within a range of reasonably possible outcomes million which is based on current information available to us  the share ncr and api will jointly bear of the total clean up costs and natural resource damages we use the low end of the range  which is based primarily on an estimate of the joint ncr api percentage of direct discharges of pcbs to the fox river  the share ncr will bear of the joint ncr api payments for clean up costs and natural resource damages we use for the first million and for amounts in excess of million  these percentages are set by an agreement between ncr and api  and an arbitration award  and our transaction costs to defend ncr in this matter we have estimated the costs we are likely to incur through  the end of the time period the governments have projected it will take to design and implement the remedy for the fox river 

table of contents at t inc and lucent technologies  inc 
are jointly responsible for indemnifying ncr for a portion of amounts for the fox river incurred by ncr over a certain threshold 
ncr s estimate of what at t and lucent will pay under the indemnity is recorded as a long term receivable of million and is deducted in determining the net amount discussed above 
also  ncr has reached settlement agreements with two of its insurance carriers and has recorded a receivable of million  which is also deducted in determining the net amount discussed above 
while it remains difficult to predict  there could be some significant near term changes to some of the above described assumptions that could have a material effect on the amount of our accrual 
also  there are other estimates for some of these factors that are significantly higher than the estimates described above  and with regard to the third factor the ncr api share of total fox river costs there is such uncertainty that we cannot quantify the high end of the range of such estimates 
in any event  assuming  for example  that the assumptions described above are each doubled except where that would be inconsistent with an existing agreement or arbitration award  our payments for the potential liabilities for the fox river matter would be approximately million to be paid out over at least the ten year period ending in  and likely as long as twenty years 
as discussed above  at t and lucent are jointly responsible for indemnifying us for a portion of amounts incurred by our company over a certain threshold  and we have reached settlements with two of our insurance carriers 
the million estimate assumes that at t  lucent and the insurance carriers will make such payments 
if we were in fact required to pay an amount such as million for ncr s share of the fox river liabilities  it would have a moderate but manageable impact on our liquidity and capital resources  assuming that such amount were required to be paid over the time frame currently contemplated 
however  if such an amount were required to be paid in a shorter time period  it could have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on our expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and our tax methods of accounting 
we also review our liabilities under sfas no 
 which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments related to uncertain tax positions  including transfer pricing related risks and  when necessary  establishes contingency reserves to account for its uncertain tax positions 
as we obtain more information via the settlement of tax audits and through other pertinent information  these projections and estimates are reassessed and may be adjusted accordingly 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
the impact to our effective tax rate would be an increase of one percentage point for each increase of million to the valuation allowance as of december  we had a valuation allowance of million as of december   related to certain deferred income tax assets  primarily tax loss carryforwards  in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to ultimate realization of a benefit from those tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance was million 
the decrease in the valuation allowance related to the settlement of international tax audits during the year and changes in local country profitability 
future changes in local country profitability may result in discrete changes affecting the need for valuation allowances 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and we incorporate such discussion in this md a by reference and make it a part hereof 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we use a variety of measures to monitor and manage these risks  including derivative financial instruments 
since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
this is primarily done through the hedging of foreign currency denominated inter company inventory purchases by the marketing units and of foreign currency denominated inventory sales by the manufacturing units 
all of these transactions are firmly committed or forecasted 
these foreign exchange contracts are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges 
the gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in the determination of income when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings 
as we hedge inventory purchases  the ultimate gain or loss from the derivative contract is recorded in cost of revenue when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party 
we have exposure to approximately functional currencies  in which our primary exposure is from fluctuations in the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are sometimes offset by strengths in others 
the us dollar was slightly weaker in as compared to based on comparable weighted averages for our functional currencies 
this had a favorable impact of less than on revenue versus revenue 
this excludes the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  does not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating income 
our strategy is to hedge  on behalf of each subsidiary  a portion of our non functional currency denominated cash flows for a period of up to months 
in this way  some of the impact of currency fluctuations on non functional currency denominated transactions and hence on subsidiary operating income  as stated in the functional currency is mitigated in the near term 
the amount we hedge and the length of time hedge contracts are entered into may vary significantly 
in the longer term longer than the hedging period of up to months  the subsidiaries are still subject to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  the subsidiary results are still subject to any impact of translating the functional currency results to us dollars 
when hedging certain foreign currency transactions of a long term investment nature net investments in foreign operations  the gains and losses are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on other foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income or expense as exchange rates change 
for purposes of potential risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to firmly committed or forecasted transactions 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
a appreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in increases of million at december  and million at december  in the fair value of the hedge portfolio 
conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in decreases of million at december  and million at december  in the fair value of the hedge portfolio 
the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at december  was not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  we swapped a portion of our senior unsecured notes from the fixed rate to a variable rate 
the swap is described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilize non exchange traded financial instruments  such as foreign exchange forward contracts that we purchase exclusively from highly rated financial institutions 
we record these contracts on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions 
we do not enter into non exchange traded contracts that require the use of fair value estimation techniques  but if we did  they could have a material impact on our financial results 
also  we do not enter into hedges for speculative purposes 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments  such as hedging instruments  short term investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals  credit limits  selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures 
our business often involves large transactions with customers for which we do not require collateral 
if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual 
table of contents arrangements  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses 
moreover  a downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis 
we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate 
at december  and  we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments
