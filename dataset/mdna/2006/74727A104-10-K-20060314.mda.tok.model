item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the twelve month periods ending december    and  and financial condition at december  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview the company was formed in february for the purpose of organizing quad city bank trust 
over the past thirteen years  the company has grown to include two additional banking subsidiaries and a number of nonbanking subsidiaries  which in aggregate totaled billion in consolidated assets as of december  the company reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for  as compared to million or basic earnings per share for  and million or basic earnings per share for earnings for were negatively impacted by anticipated increases in both personnel and facilities costs  as the subsidiary banks opened four new banking locations during the year  and by a related write off of thousand of tenant improvements at a previously occupied facility 
also during  the company absorbed the start up losses experienced by rockford bank trust  which opened at the beginning of earnings for reflected the company s issuance of million in floating rate and million in fixed floating rate trust preferred securities 
in connection with this issuance  the company redeemed  on june   million of trust preferred securities originally issued in prior to this redemption  the company had expensed thousand of unamortized issuance costs associated with the trust preferred securities in march the write off of these costs  combined with the additional interest costs of supporting both the original and the new securities from february through june  resulted in an after tax reduction to net income during of thousand  or in diluted earnings per share 
earnings for were positively impacted by the company s continued merchant credit card processing through september for an iso portfolio  which had been sold in october this iso processing contributed thousand  or in diluted earnings per share  to the company s net income during for  excluding the one time write off of the unamortized issuance costs and the additional interest costs incurred for approximately four months  net income would have been million  or diluted earnings per share of  a improvement over earnings for although excluding the impact of this event is a non gaap measure  management believes that it is important to provide such information due to the non recurring nature of this expense and to more accurately compare the results of the periods presented 
when compared to  there was solid growth in in both net interest income and noninterest income for the company 
for  net interest income and noninterest income improved by and  respectively  for a combined increase of million when compared to a decrease in the provision for loan lease losses of thousand from to also contributed positively to net income 
the successful resolution of several large credits in the subsidiary banks loan portfolios  through foreclosure  payoff  or restructuring  resulted in reductions to both provision expense and the level of allowance for loan lease losses 
merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs and trust department fees also contributed an additional thousand  in aggregate  to the company s noninterest income 
partially offsetting these revenue contributions for the company was an increase in noninterest expense of million 
the primary contributors to the increase in noninterest expense were salaries and employee benefits  which increased million from the same period in and occupancy and equipment expense  which increased million with the addition of four new banking locations during the year 
also during  the company incurred million of pretax operating costs associated with the start up of the new banking operation in rockford  illinois 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to the net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s averag tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets increased for as compared to with the same comparison  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased  which resulted in a decrease in the net interest spread of for to for the significant narrowing of the net interest spread from year to year  in turn depressed net interest margin 
for  net interest margin was compared to for management continues to closely monitor and manage net interest margin 
from a profitability standpoint  an important challenge for the subsidiary banks is the maintenance of their net interest margins 
management continually addresses this issue with the use of alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
the company s operating results are also affected by sources of noninterest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of the company include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
the company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the company has continued to add facilities and employees to accommodate both our historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
this trend is likely to continue as the company and our three banks continue to add the facilities and resources necessary to attract and serve additional customers 
trust department income continues to be a significant contributor to noninterest income 
during  trust department fees totaled million 
trust department fees contributed million in revenues during during  trust department fees totaled million 
income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
assets under administration at december  increased million during the year to million  resulting primarily from the development of existing relationships and the addition of new trust relationships 
assets under administration at december  were million  which was an increase of million from december   when assets totaled million 
critical accounting policy the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  management has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan lease losses 
the company s allowance for loan lease loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan lease loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  governmental guarantees  payment status  changes in nonperforming loans leases  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans leases  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s markets  including economic conditions throughout the midwest and in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan lease structure  existing loan lease policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology 
as the company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan lease portfolio  it enhances its methodology accordingly 
management may report a materially different amount for the provision for loan lease losses in the statement of operations to change the allowance for loan lease losses if its assessment of the above factors were different 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein  as well as the portion of this management s discussion and analysis section entitled financial condition allowance for loan lease losses 
although management believes the levels of the allowance as of december    and were adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan lease portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  or other factors  could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

commitments  contingencies  contractual obligations  and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the subsidiary banks make various commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities that are not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the commitments and contingent liabilities include various guarantees  commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the subsidiary banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the banks upon extension of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  marketable securities  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the subsidiary banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements and  generally  have terms of one year  or less 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the banks hold collateral  as described above  supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the banks would be required to fund the commitments 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the banks could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount 
if the commitment is funded  the banks would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
at december  and  no amounts had been recorded as liabilities for the banks potential obligations under these guarantees 
as of december  and  commitments to extend credit aggregated million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  standby letters of credit aggregated million and million  respectively 
management does not expect that all of these commitments will be funded 
the company had also executed contracts for the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts were included in loans held for sale at the respective balance sheet dates 
residential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market are sold with varying recourse provisions 
essentially  all loan sales agreements require the repurchase of a mortgage loan by the seller in situations such as  breach of representation  warranty  or covenant  untimely document delivery  false or misleading statements  failure to obtain certain certificates or insurance  unmarketability  etc 
certain loan sales agreements contain repurchase requirements based on payment related defects that are defined in terms of the number of days months since the purchase  the sequence number of the payment  and or the number of days of payment delinquency 
based on the specific terms stated in the agreements of investors purchasing residential mortgage loans from the company s subsidiary banks  the company had million and million of sold residential mortgage loans with recourse provisions still in effect at december  and december   respectively 
the subsidiary banks did not repurchase any loans from secondary market investors under the terms of loans sales agreements during the years ended december   or in the opinion of management  the risk of recourse to the subsidiary banks is not significant  and accordingly no liabilities have been established related to such 
during  quad city bank trust joined the federal home loan bank s fhlb mortgage partnership finance mpf program  which offers a risk sharing alternative to selling residential mortgage loans to investors in the secondary market 
lenders funding mortgages through the mpf program manage the credit risk of the loans they originate 
the loans are funded by the fhlb and held within their portfolio  thereby managing the liquidity  interest rate  and prepayment risks of the loans 
lenders participating in the mpf program receive monthly credit enhancement fees for managing the credit risk of the loans they originate 
any credit losses incurred on those loans will be absorbed first by private mortgage insurance  second by an allowance established by the fhlb  and third by withholding monthly credit enhancements due to the participating lender 
at december   quad city bank trust had funded million of mortgages through the fhlb s mpf program with an attached credit exposure of thousand 
at december   quad city bank trust had funded million of mortgages through the fhlb s mpf program with an attached credit exposure of thousand 
in conjunction with its participation in this program  quad city bank trust has established an allowance for credit losses on these off balance sheet exposures of thousand at december  and thousand at december  bancard is subject to the risk of cardholder chargebacks and its merchants being incapable of refunding the amount charged back 
management attempts to mitigate such risk by regular monitoring of merchant activity and in appropriate cases  holding cash reserves deposited by the local merchant 
until  bancard had not experienced any noteable chargeback activity in which the local or agent bank merchant s cash reserves on deposit were not sufficient to cover the chargeback volumes 
however  in  two of bancard s local merchants experienced cases of fraud and subsequent chargeback volumes that surpassed their cash reserves 
as a result  bancard incurred thousand of chargeback loss expense due to the fraudulent activity on these two merchants and the establishment in august of an allowance for chargeback losses 
throughout monthly provisions were made to the allowance for chargeback losses based on the dollar volumes of merchant credit card activity 
for the year ended december   monthly provisions were made totaling thousand 
an aggregate of thousand of reversals of specific merchant reserves during more than offset these provisions 
at deccember  and  bancard had a merchant chargeback reserve of thousand and thousand  respectively 
management will continually monitor merchant credit card volumes  related chargeback activity  and bancard s level of the allowance for chargeback losses 
the company also has a guarantee to mastercard international incorporated  which is backed by a thousand letter of credit from northern trust company 
as of december  and  there were no significant pending liabilities 
aside from cash on hand and in vault  the majority o the company s cash is maintained at upstream correspondent banks 
the total amount of cash on deposit  certificates of deposit  and federal funds sold exceeded federal insured limits by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in the opinion of management  no material risk of loss exists due to the financial condition of the upstream correspondent banks 
in an arrangement with goldman  sachs and company  cedar rapids bank trust offers a cash management program for select customers 
using this cash management tool  the customer s demand deposit account performs like an investment account 
based on a predetermined minimum balance  which must be maintained in the account  excess funds are automatically swept daily to an institutional money market fund distributed by goldman sachs 
as with a traditional demand deposit account  customers retain complete check writing and withdrawal privileges 
if the demand deposit account balance drops below the predetermined threshold  funds are automatically swept back from the money market fund at goldman sachs to the account at cedar rapids bank trust to maintain the required minimum balance 
balances swept into the money market funds are not bank deposits  are not insured by any us government agency  and do not require cash reserves to be set against the balances 
at december  and december   the company had million and million  respectively  of customer funds invested in this cash management program 
the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  which may require future cash payments 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements

the purchase obligation amounts presented primarily relate to certain contractual payments for capital expenditures of facilities expansion 
the company s operating contract obligations represent short and long term lease payments for data processing equipment and services  software  and other equipment and professional services 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in december  fasb published statement no

forward looking statements this document including information incorporated by reference contains  and future oral and written statements of the company and its management may contain  forward looking statements  within the meaning of such term in the private securities litigation reform act of  with respect to the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of the company 
forward looking statements  which may be based upon beliefs  expectations and assumptions of the company s management and on information currently available to management  are generally identifiable by the use of words such as believe  expect  anticipate  bode  predict  suggest  project  appear  plan  intend  estimate  may  will  would  could  should likely  or other similar expressions 
additionally  all statements in this document  including forward looking statements  speak only as of the date they are made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
the factors  which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the company and its subsidiaries are detailed in the risk factors section included under item a 
of part i of this form k 
in addition to the risk factors described in that section  there are other factors that may impact any public company  including ours  which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the company and its subsidiaries 
these additional factors include  but are not limited to  the following o the economic impact of past and any future terrorist attacks  acts of war or threats thereof and the response of the united states to any such threats and attacks 
o the costs  effects and outcomes of existing or future litigation 
o changes in accounting policies and practices  as may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies  the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission and the public company accounting oversight board 
o the ability of the company to manage the risks associated with the foregoing as well as anticipated 
o these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
the company s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee of the board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the full board of each bank 
management also reviews the subsidiary banks securities portfolios  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may decide to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long term and short term interest rates 
one method used to quantify interest rate risk is a short term earnings at risk summary  which is a detailed and dynamic simulation model used to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
this simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis demonstrates net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and a basis point downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
the model assumes a parallel and pro rata shift in interest rates over a twelve month period 
application of the simulation model analysis at december  demonstrated a decrease in interest income with a basis point increase in interest rates  and a increase in interest income with a basis point decrease in interest rates 
both simulations are within the board established policy limits of a decline in value 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
for that reason  the company engages the assistance of a national consulting firm and their risk management system to monitor and control the company s interest rate risk exposure 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities
