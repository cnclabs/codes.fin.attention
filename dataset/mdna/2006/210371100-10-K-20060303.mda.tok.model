item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview constellation energy group  inc constellation energy is an energy company that conducts its business through various subsidiaries including a merchant energy business and baltimore gas and electric company bge 
we describe our operating segments in note this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the regulated business es are to bge 
we discuss our business in more detail in item business section and the risk factors affecting our business in item a 
risk factors section 
in this discussion and analysis  we will explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including factors which affect our businesses  our earnings and costs in the periods presented  changes in earnings and costs between periods  sources of earnings  impact of these factors on our overall financial condition  expected future expenditures for capital projects  and expected sources of cash for future capital expenditures 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of our consolidated statements of income 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows first  we discuss our strategy 
we then describe the business environment in which we operate including how regulation  weather  and other factors affect our business 
next  we discuss our critical accounting policies 
these are the accounting policies that are most important to both the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
we highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we then review our results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results  followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment 
we review our financial condition addressing our sources and uses of cash  security ratings  capital resources  capital requirements  commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements 
we conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks 
pending merger with fpl group  inc in order to further our strategies discussed below  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with fpl group  inc fpl group 
we discuss our pending merger with fpl group in more detail in note strategy we are pursuing a strategy of providing energy and energy related services through our competitive supply activities and bge  our regulated utility located in maryland 
our merchant energy business focuses on short term and long term purchases and sales of energy  capacity  and related products to various customers  including distribution utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  industrial customers  and commercial customers 
we obtain this energy through both owned and contracted supply resources 
our generation fleet is strategically located in deregulated markets across the country and is diversified by fuel type  including nuclear  coal  gas  oil  and renewable sources 
in addition to owning generating facilities  we contract for power from other merchant providers  typically through power purchase agreements 
we intend to remain diversified between regulated transmission and distribution and competitive supply 
we will use both our owned generation and our contracted generation to support our competitive supply operations 
we are a leading national competitive supplier of energy 
in our wholesale and commercial and industrial retail marketing activities we are leveraging our recognized expertise in providing full requirements energy and energy related services to enter markets  capture market share  and organically grow these businesses 
through the application of technology  intellectual capital  process improvement  and increased scale  we are seeking to reduce the cost of delivering full requirements energy and energy related services and managing risk 
we are also responding proactively to customer needs by expanding the variety of products we offer 
our wholesale competitive supply activities include a growing operation that markets physical energy products and risk management and logistics services to generators  distributors  producers of coal  natural gas and fuel oil  and other consumers 
as part of our risk management activities  we trade energy and energy related commodities and deploy risk capital in the management of our portfolio in order to earn additional returns 
these activities are managed through daily value at risk and stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines 
within our retail competitive supply activities  we are marketing a broader array of products and expanding our markets 
over time  we may consider integrating the sale of electricity and natural gas to provide one energy procurement solution for our customers 
collectively  the integration of owned and contracted electric generation assets with origination  fuel procurement  and risk management expertise  allows our merchant energy business to earn incremental margin and more effectively manage energy and commodity price risk over geographic regions and over time 
our focus is on providing solutions to customers energy needs  and our wholesale marketing and risk management operation adds value to our owned and contracted generation assets by providing national market access  market infrastructure  real time market intelligence  risk management and arbitrage opportunities  and transmission and transportation expertise 
generation capacity supports our wholesale marketing and risk management operation by providing a source of reliable power supply 
to achieve our strategic objectives  we expect to continue to pursue opportunities that expand our access to customers and to support our wholesale marketing and risk management operation with generation assets that have diversified geographic  fuel  and dispatch characteristics 
we also expect to grow through buying and selling a greater number of physical energy products and services to large energy customers 
we expect to achieve operating efficiencies within our competitive supply operation and our generation fleet by selling more products through our existing sales force  benefiting from efficiencies of scale  adding to the capacity of existing plants  and making our business processes more efficient 
we expect bge and our other retail energy service businesses to grow through focused and disciplined expansion primarily from new customers 
at bge  we are also focused on enhancing reliability and customer satisfaction 
customer choice  regulatory change  and energy market conditions significantly impact our business 
in response  we regularly evaluate our strategies with these goals in mind to improve our competitive position  to anticipate and adapt to the business environment and regulatory changes  and to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit quality 
we are constantly reevaluating our strategies and might consider acquiring or developing additional generating facilities and gas properties to support our merchant energy business  mergers or acquisitions of utility or non utility businesses or assets  and sale of assets or one or more businesses 
business environment with the evolving regulatory environment surrounding customer choice  increasing competition  and the growth of our merchant energy business  various factors affect our financial results 
we discuss some of these factors in more detail in the item business competition section 
we also discuss these various factors in the forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
over the last several years  the energy markets have been highly volatile with significant changes in natural gas  power  oil  coal  and emission allowance prices 
the volatility of the energy markets impacts our credit portfolio  and we continue to actively manage our credit portfolio to attempt to reduce the impact of a potential counterparty default 
we discuss our customer counterparty credit and other risks in more detail in the market risk section 
in addition  the volatility of the energy markets impacts our liquidity and collateral requirements 
we discuss our liquidity in the financial condition section 
competition we face competition in the sale of electricity  natural gas  and coal in wholesale energy markets and to retail customers 
various states have moved to restructure their electricity markets 
the pace of deregulation in these states varies based on historical moves to competition and responses to recent market events 
while many states continue to support retail competition and industry restructuring  other states that were considering deregulation have slowed their plans or postponed consideration 
in addition  other states are reconsidering deregulation 
all bge electricity and gas customers have the option to purchase electricity and gas from alternate suppliers 
we discuss merchant competition in more detail in item business competition section 
the impacts of electric deregulation on bge in maryland are discussed in item business electric regulatory matters and competition section 
regulation by the maryland psc in addition to electric restructuring  which is discussed in item business electric regulatory matters and competition section  regulation by the maryland public service commission maryland psc significantly influences bge s businesses 
the maryland psc determines the rates that bge can charge customers of its electric distribution and gas businesses 
the maryland psc incorporates into bge s standard offer service rates the transmission rates determined by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
bge s electric rates are unbundled in customer billings to show separate components for delivery service ie base rates  competitive transition charges ctc  electric supply commodity charge  transmission  a universal service surcharge  and certain taxes 
the rates for bge s regulated gas business continue to consist of a delivery charge base rate and a commodity charge 
base rates base rates are the rates the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them delivery service  plus a profit 
bge has both electric base rates and gas base rates 
higher electric base rates apply during the summer when the demand for electricity is higher 
gas base rates are not affected by seasonal changes 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover its utility plant investment and operating costs  plus a profit 
generally  rate increases improve the earnings of our regulated business because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
as a result of the deregulation of electric generation in maryland  bge s residential electric base rates are frozen until july electric base rates were frozen until july for commercial and industrial customers 
in early  the maryland psc commenced a proceeding  and legislation was introduced in the maryland general assembly  to consider methods for requiring bge to defer recovery of some of its costs of providing residential polr service 
these actions are a result of the anticipated increase in polr prices expected to take place upon the expiration of the residential rate freeze in june any decision by the maryland psc or legislation adopted by the maryland general assembly  that would defer recovery of  or would not allow bge to fully recover its costs could have a material impact on our  and bge s  financial results and liquidity 
we discuss electric deregulation in item business electric regulatory matters and competition section 
in april  bge filed an application for a million annual increase in its gas base rates 
the maryland psc issued an order in december granting bge an annual increase of million 
certain parties to the proceeding have sought judicial review and maryland psc rehearing of the decision 
bge will not seek review of any aspect of the order 
we cannot provide assurance that a court will not reverse any aspect of the order or that it will not remand certain issues to the maryland psc 
electric commodity and transmission charges bge electric commodity and transmission charges standard offer service are discussed in item business electric regulatory matters and competition section 
gas commodity charge bge charges its gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase 
the price bge charges for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates in more detail in the regulated gas business gas cost adjustments section and in note federal regulation ferc the ferc has jurisdiction over various aspects of our business  including transmission and wholesale electricity sales 
we believe that ferc s continued commitment to competition in wholesale energy markets should result in improved competitive markets across various regions 
since  operation of bge s transmission system has been under the authority of pjm interconnection pjm  the regional transmission organization rto for the mid atlantic region  pursuant to ferc oversight 
as the transmission operator  pjm operates the energy markets and conducts day to day operations of the bulk power system 
the liability of transmission owners  including bge  and power generators is limited to those damages caused by the gross negligence of such entities 
in addition to pjm  rtos exist in other regions of the country  such as the midwest  new york  and new england 
in addition to operation of the transmission system and responsibility for transmission system reliability  these rtos also operate energy markets for their region pursuant to ferc s oversight 
our merchant energy business participates in these regional energy markets 
these markets are continuing to develop  and revisions to market structure are subject to review and approval by ferc and other regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict the outcome of such a review at this time 
however  changes to the structure of these markets could have a material effect on our financial results 
recent initiatives at ferc have included a review of its methodology for the granting of market based rate authority to sellers of electricity 
ferc has announced new interim tests that will be used to determine the extent to which companies may have market power in certain regions 
where market power is found to exist  ferc may require companies to implement measures to mitigate the market power in order to maintain market based rate authority 
in addition  ferc is reviewing other aspects of its granting of market based rate authority  including transmission market power  affiliate abuse  and barriers to entry 
we cannot determine the eventual outcome of ferc s efforts in this regard and their impact on our financial results at this time 
in november  ferc eliminated through and out transmission rates between the midwest independent system operators miso and pjm and put in place seams elimination charge cost adjustment assignment seca transition rates  which are paid by the transmission customers of miso and pjm and allocated among the various transmission owners in pjm and miso 
the seca transition rates are in effect from december  through march  ferc has set for hearing the various compliance filings that established the level of the seca rates and has indicated that the seca rates are being recovered from the miso and pjm transmission customers subject to refund by the miso and pjm transmission owners 
in addition  ferc has indicated that it will provide transmission customers that are charged the seca rates with an opportunity to demonstrate that such charges should be shifted to their wholesale power suppliers 
we are a recipient of seca payments  payer of seca charges  and supplier to whom such charges may be shifted 
we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of ferc s seca rate proceeding 
however  as the amounts collected under the seca rates are subject to refund and the ultimate outcome of the proceeding establishing seca rates is uncertain  the result of this proceeding may have a material effect on our financial results 
in may  ferc issued an order accepting bge s joint application to have network transmission rates established through a formula that tracks costs instead of through fixed rates 
the formula approach became effective june   and the implementation of these rates did not have a material effect on our  or bge s  financial results 
the use of this formula approach is subject to refund based on the outcome of a hearing before an administrative law judge 
the hearing process has been suspended while the various parties discuss a possible settlement 
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or whether ferc will ultimately affirm either a settlement or the judge s decision 
other market changes are also being considered  including potential revisions to pjm s capacity market and rate design 
such changes will be subject to ferc s review and approval 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the possible effect on our  or bge s  financial results at this time 
federal energy legislation the energy policy act of epact was signed by the president on august  the legislation encourages investments in energy production and delivery infrastructure  including further development of competitive wholesale energy markets  and promotes the use of a diverse mix of fuels and renewable technologies to generate electricity  including federal support and tax incentives for clean coal  nuclear  and renewable power generation 
effective february  the legislation repealed the public utility holding company act of puhca 
in addition  there are a number of ferc rulemaking proceedings that relate to the implementation of epact including proceedings relating to ferc s new responsibilities following the repeal of puhca  its revised merger authority  its new authority over electric grid reliability  and its new authority with respect to addressing electric and gas market manipulation 
while ferc has moved expeditiously to implement its new authority under epact  at this time we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these rules or the possible effect on our business or financial results given that these rules may be subject to further revision or clarification as a result of requests for rehearing or court appeals but they could have a material impact on our financial results 
there are also rulemakings required from other federal agencies  the outcome of which could affect our financial results  but we cannot at this time predict such outcome or the actual effect on our financial results 
weather merchant energy business weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our merchant energy business 
weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity  gas  and fuels 
changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market  which may affect our results in any given period 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
the demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time  thus we are not typically exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of our business at once 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
weather affects residential sales more than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
the maryland psc allows bge to record a monthly adjustment to our regulated gas business revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns 
we discuss this further in the regulated gas business weather normalization section 
other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our merchant energy business 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  number of market participants  extreme peak demands  available supply resources  transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  implementation of new market rules governing operations of regional power pools  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and international supply and demand 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  local transportation systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
our merchant energy business contracts for the delivery of coal to our coal fired generation facilities 
the timely delivery of coal together with the maintenance of appropriate levels of inventory is necessary to allow for continued  reliable generation from these facilities 
in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  we experienced delays in deliveries from one of the rail companies that supplies coal to our generating facilities 
in response  we procured coal using an alternative delivery method to meet our contractual load obligations 
we discuss the impact of these delays on our financial results in the mid atlantic region section 
the majority of the coal that was not delivered during was delivered during other factors also impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downturn  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental matters and legal proceedings we discuss details of our environmental matters in note and item business environmental matters section 
we discuss details of our legal proceedings in note some of this information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards adopted and issued we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income  our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note accounting for derivatives our merchant energy business originates and acquires contracts for energy  other energy related commodities  and related derivatives 
we record merchant energy business revenues using two methods of accounting accrual accounting and mark to market accounting 
the accounting requirements for derivatives are governed by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and applying those requirements involves the exercise of judgment in evaluating these provisions  as well as related implementation guidance and applying those requirements to complex contracts in a variety of commodities and markets 
we record revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses from the sale or purchase of energy  energy related products  and energy services under the accrual method of accounting in the period when we deliver or receive energy commodities  products  and services  or settle contracts 
we use accrual accounting for our merchant energy and other nonregulated business transactions  including the generation or purchase and sale of electricity  gas  and coal as part of our physical delivery activities and for power  gas  and coal sales contracts that are not subject to mark to market accounting 
contracts that are eligible for accrual accounting include non derivative transactions and derivatives that qualify for and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales of commodities that will be physically delivered 
the use of accrual accounting requires us to analyze contracts to determine whether they are non derivatives or  if they are derivatives  whether they meet the requirements for designation as normal purchases and normal sales 
for those contracts that do not meet these criteria  we may also analyze whether they qualify for hedge accounting  including performing an evaluation of historical market price information to determine whether such contracts are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows from the risk being hedged 
we record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected hedge accounting in risk management assets and liabilities 
we use the mark to market method of accounting for derivative contracts for which we are not permitted to use accrual accounting or hedge accounting 
these mark to market activities include derivative contracts for energy and other energy related commodities 
under the mark to market method of accounting  we record the fair value of these derivatives as mark to market energy assets and liabilities at the time of contract execution 
we record the changes in mark to market energy assets and liabilities in our consolidated statements of income 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related derivative contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
the market prices and quantities used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering various factors 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
we record valuation adjustments to reflect uncertainties associated with certain estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities 
the effect of these uncertainties is not incorporated in market price information or other market based estimates used to determine fair value of our mark to market energy contracts 
to the extent possible  we utilize market based data together with quantitative methods for both measuring the uncertainties for which we record valuation adjustments and determining the level of such adjustments and changes in those levels 
we describe on the next page the main types of valuation adjustments we record and the process for establishing each 
generally  increases in valuation adjustments reduce our earnings  and decreases in valuation adjustments increase our earnings 
however  all or a portion of the effect on earnings of changes in valuation adjustments may be offset by changes in the value of the underlying positions 
close out adjustment represents the estimated cost to close out or sell to a third party open mark to market positions 
this valuation adjustment has the effect of valuing long positions the purchase of a commodity at the bid price and short positions the sale of a commodity at the offer price 
we compute this adjustment using a market based estimate of the bid offer spread for each commodity and option price and the absolute quantity of our net open positions for each year 
the level of total close out valuation adjustments increases as we have larger unhedged positions  bid offer spreads increase  or market information is not available  and it decreases as we reduce our unhedged positions  bid offer spreads decrease  or market information becomes available 
to the extent that we are not able to obtain observable market information for similar contracts  the close out adjustment is equivalent to the initial contract margin  thereby resulting in no gain or loss at inception 
in the absence of observable market information  there is a presumption that the transaction price is equal to the market value of the contract  and therefore we do not recognize a gain or loss at inception 
we recognize such gains or losses in earnings as we realize cash flows under the contract or when observable market data becomes available 
credit spread adjustment for risk management purposes  we compute the value of our mark to market energy assets and liabilities using a risk free discount rate 
in order to compute fair value for financial reporting purposes  we adjust the value of our mark to market energy assets to reflect the credit worthiness of each counterparty based upon either published credit ratings  or equivalent internal credit ratings and associated default probability percentages 
we compute this adjustment by applying a default probability percentage to our outstanding credit exposure  net of collateral  for each counterparty 
the level of this adjustment increases as our credit exposure to counterparties increases  the maturity terms of our transactions increase  or the credit ratings of our counterparties deteriorate  and it decreases when our credit exposure to counterparties decreases  the maturity terms of our transactions decrease  or the credit ratings of our counterparties improve 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors  and changes in market prices affect both the recorded fair value of our mark to market energy contracts and the level of future revenues and costs associated with accrual basis activities 
changes in the value of our mark to market energy contracts will affect our earnings in the period of the change  while changes in forward market prices related to accrual basis revenues and costs will affect our earnings in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
we cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could affect us either favorably or unfavorably 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the market risk section 
the impact of derivative contracts on our revenues and costs is affected by many factors  including our ability to designate and qualify derivative contracts for normal purchase and sale accounting or hedge accounting under sfas no 
 potential volatility in earnings from ineffectiveness associated with derivatives subject to hedge accounting  potential volatility in earnings from derivative contracts that serve as economic hedges but do not meet the accounting requirements to qualify for normal purchase and normal sale accounting or hedge accounting  our ability to enter into new mark to market derivative origination transactions  and sufficient liquidity and transparency in the energy markets to permit us to record gains at inception of new derivative contracts because fair value is evidenced by quoted market prices  current market transactions  or other observable market information 
evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value long lived assets we are required to evaluate certain assets that have long lives for example  generating property and equipment and real estate to determine if they are impaired when certain conditions exist 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides the accounting requirements for impairments of long lived assets 
we are required to test our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes are a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition  an adverse action by a regulator or legislation or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used  sfas no 
provides that an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable under sfas no 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets 
this necessarily requires us to estimate uncertain future cash flows 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
if we are considering alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset such as the potential sale of an asset  we probability weight the alternative courses of action to estimate the cash flows 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
for long lived assets that can be classified as assets held for sale under sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized to the extent their carrying amount exceeds their fair value less costs to sell 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
the estimation of fair value under sfas no 
 whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
we consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
often  we will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as discussed above with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
we are also required to evaluate our equity method and cost method investments for example  in partnerships that own power projects to determine whether or not they are impaired 
accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  provides the accounting requirements for these investments 
the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under apb no 
is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments under the apb no 
standard involves the same uncertainties as described on the previous page for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with sfas no 
similarly  the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subject to variation  and the impact of such variations could be material 
additionally  if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value under apb no 
gas properties we evaluate unproved property at least annually to determine if it is impaired under sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing properties 
impairment for unproved property occurs if there are no firm plans to continue drilling  lease expiration is at risk  or historical experience necessitates a valuation allowance 
debt and equity securities our investments in debt and equity securities  primarily our nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets  are subject to impairment evaluations under fasb staff position sfas and sfas fsp and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp and requires us to determine whether a decline in fair value of an investment below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
if we determine that the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment must be written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we account for goodwill and other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires us to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the business might be impaired 
goodwill is impaired if the carrying value of the business exceeds fair value 
annually  we estimate the fair value of the businesses we have acquired using techniques similar to those used to estimate future cash flows for long lived assets as discussed on the previous page  which involves judgment 
if the estimated fair value of the business is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is greater than its fair value 
asset retirement obligations we incur legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain long lived assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  provides the accounting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we incur such legal obligations as a result of environmental and other government regulations  contractual agreements  and other factors 
the application of this standard requires significant judgment due to the large number and diverse nature of the assets in our various businesses and the estimation of future cash flows required to measure legal obligations associated with the retirement of specific assets 
fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 clarifies that obligations that are conditional upon a future event are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the use of an expected present value methodology in measuring asset retirement obligations that involves judgment surrounding the inherent uncertainty of the probability  amount and timing of payments to settle these obligations  and the appropriate interest rates to discount future cash flows 
we use our best estimates in identifying and measuring our asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
our nuclear decommissioning costs represent our largest asset retirement obligation 
this obligation primarily results from the requirement to decommission and decontaminate our nuclear generating facilities in connection with their future retirement 
we utilize site specific decommissioning cost estimates to determine our nuclear asset retirement obligations 
however  given the magnitude of the amounts involved  complicated and ever changing technical and regulatory requirements  and the very long time horizons involved  the actual obligation could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
significant events pending merger with fpl group  inc on december   constellation energy entered into an agreement and plan of merger with fpl group  inc we discuss the details of this pending merger in note prior to the merger  which is subject to shareholder and various regulatory approvals  constellation energy and fpl group will continue to operate as separate companies 
the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition beginning on the next page relates solely to constellation energy 
commodity prices during  the energy markets were affected by higher commodity prices caused by a tight supply and demand balance  the impact of hot weather  and hurricane related supply disruptions in the gulf coast 
these events contributed to the following changes in our financial statements total mark to market assets increased  million and total mark to market liabilities increased  million since december   total risk management assets increased  million and total risk management liabilities increased million since december   customer deposits and collateral increased million since december   accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million since december   total revenues increased  million during compared to  and total fuel and purchased energy expenses increased  million during compared to the same period of we discuss the impact of higher commodity prices on our financial condition and results of operations in more detail in the following sections merchant energy results  financial condition  contractual payment obligations and committed amounts  and market risk 
discontinued operations in june  we sold our oleander generating facility and in october  we sold constellation power international investments  ltd  which held our other nonregulated international investments 
our other nonregulated international investments included our interests in a panamanian electric distribution facility and a fund that holds interests in two south american energy projects 
we discuss the sale of the oleander generating facility and our other nonregulated international investments in more detail in the note business combination and asset acquisition in april  we acquired cogenex corporation and in june  we acquired working interests in gas producing fields in texas and alabama 
we discuss these transactions in more detail in note dividend increase in january  we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to per share on our common stock 
this is equivalent to an annual rate of per share 
previously  our quarterly dividend on our common stock was per share  equivalent to an annual rate of per share 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments 
significant changes in other income and expense  fixed charges  and income taxes are discussed in the aggregate for all segments in the consolidated nonoperating income and expenses section 
overview results in millions  after tax merchant energy regulated electric regulated gas other nonregulated income from continuing operations and before cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles net income other items included in operations non qualifying hedges merger related transaction costs workforce reduction costs recognition of synthetic fuel tax credits total other items our total net income for increased million  or per share  compared to the same period of mostly because of the following we had higher earnings of approximately million at our wholesale marketing and risk management operation 
this increase is primarily due to the realization of higher gross margin  which included the termination or restructuring of several energy contracts and higher mark to market results in earnings 
we discuss these terminations  restructurings  and mark to market results in more detail in the competitive supply section 
this increase in earnings was partially offset by higher load serving costs resulting from extreme weather and volatile commodity prices and higher operating expenses 
we recorded higher income from discontinued operations of million after tax 
in  we recorded in income loss from discontinued operations earnings of million related to the sale of our oleander generating facility and our other nonregulated international investments 
in  we recorded in income loss from discontinued operations a loss of million after tax related to the sale of our hawaiian geothermal facility which had a negative impact in that period 
the loss was offset by the reclassification of earnings of million after tax from our oleander and international operations to income loss from discontinued operations 
we discuss the sale of these operations in more detail in note we had higher earnings of million after tax primarily due to higher interest and investment income due to a higher cash balance  and higher decommissioning trust asset earnings  and lower interest expense resulting from the maturity of million in long term debt in and the favorable impact of floating rate swaps 
we had higher earnings of million after tax at our nine mile point and ginna facilities primarily due to productivity improvements and cost saving initiatives partially offset by inflationary cost increases and costs associated with the planned refueling outage at ginna 
we had higher earnings of million after tax at our regulated businesses primarily due to favorable weather during compared to we had higher earnings of approximately million after tax due to the absence of coal delivery issues that were experienced in that had a negative impact in that period 
we discuss the coal delivery issues in more detail in the business environment other factors section 
we had higher earnings from our other nonregulated businesses of million after tax  including higher gains from the continued liquidation of our non core investments and the results of cogenex  which was acquired in april we discuss the acquisition of cogenex in more detail in note we had higher earnings at our south carolina synthetic fuel facility of million after tax due to a higher level of production in compared to these increases were partially offset by the following our merchant energy business recognized million of synthetic fuel tax credits in which had a positive impact in that period 
we had lower earnings at our retail competitive supply operation of million after tax primarily due to higher costs to serve our load obligations in texas and the absence of bankruptcy settlements that had a favorable impact in we had lower earnings of million after tax related to losses associated with certain economic hedges that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we discuss these economic hedges in more detail in the mark to market section 
we had lower earnings of million after tax due to external costs associated with the execution of our merger agreement with fpl group 
we had lower earnings of million after tax due to lower ctc revenues at our merchant energy business 
we had lower earnings of million after tax related to the impact of expensing stock options during the fourth quarter of we had lower earnings of million after tax due to the cumulative effect of adopting fin and sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we discuss the adoption of these standards in detail in note earnings per share was impacted by additional dilution  including the issuance of million shares of common stock on july  our total net income for increased million  or per share  compared to the same period of mostly because of the following in  we recorded a million after tax loss for the cumulative effect of adopting emerging issues task force eitf issue  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
this was partially offset by a million after tax gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
these items had a combined negative impact during our merchant energy business had higher earnings of million at our south carolina synthetic fuel facility primarily due to the recognition of million in tax credits associated with production and tax credits associated with production 
we had higher earnings from our regulated electric business mostly because of the absence of million of after tax incremental operations and maintenance expenses due to distribution service restoration efforts associated with hurricane isabel in we had higher earnings from our nuclear generating assets due to the june acquisition of ginna  which contributed million after tax  and higher generation at our calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  partially offset by lower generation by and lower power prices for the output of our nine mile point facility in compared to we had higher earnings from our merchant energy business mostly due to the realization of wholesale contracts originated in prior periods  portfolio management  and favorable settlements at our retail electric operation of million pre tax 
we had higher earnings due to lower after tax losses of million associated with certain economic hedges that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we discuss these economic hedges in more detail in the mark to market section 
we had higher earnings of million after tax in due to a full year of operations at the high desert facility 
these increases were partially offset by the following we recorded a million after tax  loss from discontinued operations on the sale of our hawaiian geothermal facility 
we had higher sarbanes oxley implementation costs of approximately million pre tax  higher enterprise information systems expenditures of approximately million pre tax  and higher compensation  benefit  and other inflationary cost increases 
we had lower earnings from our regulated gas business mostly because of million after tax of higher operations and maintenance expenses in and the absence of a million after tax market based rate gas recovery  which had a favorable effect in we recognized a gain of million after tax related to non core asset sales in that had a favorable impact in that period 
earnings per share was impacted by additional dilution resulting from the issuance of million shares of common stock on july  merchant energy business background our merchant energy business is a competitive provider of energy solutions for various customers 
we discuss the impact of deregulation on our merchant energy business in item business competition section 
our merchant energy business focuses on delivery of physical  customer oriented products to producers and consumers  manages the risk and optimizes the value of our owned generation assets  and uses our portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns 
we record merchant energy revenues and expenses in our financial results in different periods depending upon which portion of our business they affect 
we discuss our revenue recognition policies in the critical accounting policies section and in note we summarize our revenue and expense recognition policies as follows we record revenues as they are earned and fuel and purchased energy expenses as they are incurred for contracts and activities subject to accrual accounting  including certain load serving activities 
prior to the settlement of the forecasted transaction being hedged  we record changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective 
we record the effective portion of the changes in fair value of hedges in earnings in the period the settlement of the hedged transaction occurs 
we record the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value of hedges  if any  in earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
we record changes in the fair value of contracts that are subject to mark to market accounting in revenues or fuel and purchased energy expenses in the period in which the change occurs 
mark to market accounting requires us to make estimates and assumptions using judgment in determining the fair value of certain contracts and in recording revenues from those contracts 
we discuss the effects of mark to market accounting on our results in the competitive supply mark to market section 
we discuss mark to market accounting and the accounting policies for the merchant energy business further in the critical accounting policies section and in note our wholesale marketing and risk management operation actively uses energy and energy related commodities in order to manage our portfolio of energy purchases and sales to customers through structured transactions 
as part of our risk management activities we trade energy and energy related commodities and deploy risk capital in the management of our portfolio in order to earn additional returns 
these activities are managed through daily value at risk and stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines  and may have a material impact on our financial results 
we discuss the impact of our trading activities and value at risk in more detail in the competitive supply mark to market and market risk sections

above amounts include intercompany transactions eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses our merchant energy business manages the revenues we realize from the sale of energy to our customers and our costs of procuring fuel and energy 
the difference between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses is the gross margin of our merchant energy business  and this measure is a useful tool for assessing the profitability of our merchant energy business 
accordingly  we believe it is appropriate to discuss the operating results of our merchant energy business by analyzing the changes in gross margin between periods 
in managing our portfolio  we may terminate  restructure  or acquire contracts 
such transactions are within the normal course of managing our portfolio and may materially impact the timing of our recognition of revenues  fuel and purchased energy expenses  and cash flows 
we analyze our merchant energy gross margin in the following categories because of the risk profile of each category  differences in the revenue sources  and the nature of fuel and purchased energy expenses 
with the exception of a portion of our competitive supply activities that we are required to account for using the mark to market method of accounting  all of these activities are accounted for on an accrual basis 
mid atlantic region our fossil  nuclear  and hydroelectric generating facilities and load serving activities in the pjm interconnection pjm region 
this also includes active portfolio management of the generating assets and other physical and financial contractual arrangements  as well as other pjm competitive supply activities

we also provide global coal and upstream and downstream natural gas services 
retail competitive supply our operation that provides electric and gas energy products and services to commercial  industrial and governmental customers

mid atlantic region in millions revenues    fuel and purchased energy expenses  gross margin the decrease in mid atlantic region gross margin in compared to is primarily due to rising commodity prices and hotter than normal weather during the third quarter of  which resulted in higher load serving costs 
in addition  ctc revenues were million lower during compared to the same period of these decreases in gross margin were partially offset by the absence of coal delivery issues that we experienced in that had a negative impact in that period 
we discuss the coal delivery issues in the business environment other factors section 
ctc revenues will continue to decrease as residential  commercial  and industrial customers complete their ctc obligation 
ctc revenues will be completely phased out for residential customers by june  and ctc revenues for commercial and industrial customers will begin to be phased out after june  we discuss the change in ctc revenue over time in more detail in item business 
the slight decrease in mid atlantic region gross margin in compared to is primarily due to lower fossil plant availability resulting in lower gross margin of million and higher coal costs primarily due to purchasing coal from alternative suppliers in at higher prices than in as a result of delays in deliveries 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in margin of million related to new load serving obligations  offset in part by lower volumes served to bge resulting from small commercial customers leaving bge s standard offer service due to the end of fixed price service in june plants with power purchase agreements in millions revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses gross margin the increase in gross margin from our plants with power purchase agreements in compared to was primarily due to higher gross margin of million from ginna  which was acquired in june this increase in gross margin at ginna includes an increase in revenues of million 
we discuss this acquisition in more detail in note  and higher gross margin of million at our nine mile point facility that benefited from higher generation primarily due to fewer refueling outage days  the absence of an unplanned outage that occurred in january  and higher prices on the portion of our output sold into the wholesale market 
these increases in gross margin were partially offset by million primarily related to changes in commodity prices that had a negative impact on realized hedging activities related to the portion of these facilities sold into the wholesale market 
the increase in gross margin from our plants with power purchase agreements in compared to is primarily due to gross margin of million from ginna 
the increase in gross margin includes higher revenues of million  and higher gross margin of million from the high desert facility that contributed a full year of gross margin in compared to eight months in these increases in gross margin were partially offset by lower gross margin of million at our nine mile point facility primarily due to lower revenues from reduced contract prices for the output in compared to and lower generation 
competitive supply retail in millions accrual revenues    mark to market results recorded in earnings fuel and purchased energy expenses    gross margin the slight increase in gross margin from our retail competitive supply activities in compared to is primarily due to serving approximately million more megawatt hours in compared to mostly due to the growth of this operation and the positive impact of certain contracts that were recorded as mark to market 
these increases were substantially offset by a combination of higher market prices for electricity  price volatility  and increased customer usage primarily in texas  which increased our cost to serve our load serving obligations 
the expiration of higher margin contracts  and the absence of favorable bankruptcy settlements  which had a positive impact in we discuss the favorable bankruptcy settlements below 
the increase in gross margin from our retail competitive supply activities in compared to is primarily due to higher electric gross margin of million mostly due to serving approximately million more megawatt hours partially offset by lower realized margins due to increased wholesale power costs in compared to  a bankruptcy settlement from pg e of million in  and a favorable settlement of a pre acquisition liability of million also related to a bankruptcy proceeding in  and lower contract amortization  which reduced margin by million  relating to the fair value of contracts acquired 
in addition  we had higher gas gross margin contribution of million from blackhawk energy services and kaztex energy management  which were acquired in october we discuss our acquisitions in more detail in note wholesale in millions accrual revenues    fuel and purchased energy expenses    wholesale accrual activities mark to market results recorded in earnings gross margin we analyze our wholesale accrual and mark to market competitive supply activities separately on the next page 
wholesale accrual activities our wholesale marketing and risk management operation s accrual gross margin was million higher in compared to primarily due to newly originated and realized business in power  gas  and coal in  including several contract terminations and restructurings 
during  we terminated or restructured several in the money contracts in exchange for upfront cash payments and a reduction or cancellation of future performance obligations 
the termination or restructuring of two contracts allowed us to lower our exposure to performance risk under these contracts  and resulted in the realization of million of pre tax earnings in that would have been recognized over the life of these contracts 
these increases were partially offset by lower gross margins of approximately million mostly due to the absence of several favorable items  including settlements  power prices  and contracts that had a positive impact in the increase in gross margin from our wholesale accrual activities in compared to is primarily due to approximately million in the new england region due to higher realized contract margins in compared to and higher volumes served 
this increase was partially offset by higher transportation costs for our gas trading portfolio of approximately million 
the transportation costs associated with this portfolio are accounted for on an accrual basis  while our gas trading portfolio is recorded as mark to market 
in addition  we incurred higher operating costs of million related to our south carolina synthetic fuel facility 
mark to market mark to market results recorded in earnings include net gains and losses from origination  trading  and risk management activities for which we use the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss these activities and the mark to market method of accounting in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note as a result of the nature of our operations and the use of mark to market accounting for certain activities  mark to market earnings will fluctuate 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the impact on our earnings could be material 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the market risk section 
the primary factors that cause fluctuations in our mark to market results recorded in earnings are the number  size  and profitability of new transactions including terminations or restructuring of existing contracts  the number and size of our open derivative positions  and changes in the level and volatility of forward commodity prices and interest rates 
mark to market results recorded in earnings were as follows in millions unrealized mark to market results recorded in earnings origination gains risk management and trading unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total risk management and trading total unrealized mark to market realized mark to market total mark to market results recorded in earnings total unrealized mark to market is the sum of origination transactions and total risk management and trading 
origination gains arise primarily from contracts that our wholesale marketing and risk management operation structures to meet the risk management needs of our customers 
transactions that result in origination gains may be unique and provide the potential for individually significant gains from a single transaction 
origination gains represent the initial fair value recognized on these structured transactions 
the recognition of origination gains is dependent on the existence of observable market data that validates the initial fair value of the contract 
origination gains arose primarily from transactions completed in  one of which contributed approximately million pre tax  transactions completed in  of which no transaction contributed in excess of million pre tax  and transactions completed in  of which one transaction contributed approximately million pre tax 
as noted above  the recognition of origination gains is dependent on sufficient observable market data 
liquidity and market conditions impact our ability to identify sufficient  objective market price information to permit recognition of origination gains 
as a result  while our strategy and competitive position provide the opportunity to continue to originate such transactions  the level of origination gains we are able to recognize may vary from year to year as a result of the number  size  and market price transparency of the individual transactions executed in any period 
risk management and trading represents both realized and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the value of our portfolio  including the recognition of gains associated with decreases in the close out adjustment when we are able to obtain sufficient market price information 
we discuss the changes in mark to market results recorded in earnings on the next page 
we show the relationship between our mark to market results recorded in earnings and the change in our net mark to market energy asset later on the next page 
mark to market results recorded in earnings increased million in compared to due to approximately million primarily related to a higher level of risk management and trading activities 
increases in our gas and coal activities  higher commodity price volatility  and greater market liquidity resulted in more opportunities to deploy risk capital and to earn additional returns in compared to these items resulted in an increased number of transactions that were entered into and realized during and a higher level of open positions that resulted in increased gains in compared to during  slightly more than half of the mark to market results were derived from power  approximately one third from gas  and the remainder from other transactions 
million related to a higher level of origination gains as discussed on the previous page  and million related to the decrease in the close out adjustment during compared to the prior year for transactions that we have now observed sufficient market price information and or we realized cash flows since the transactions inception 
these increases in mark to market results recorded in earnings were partially offset by the impact of million of higher mark to market losses on certain economic hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we discuss these economic hedges in more detail below 
mark to market results recorded in earnings increased million in compared to mostly because of the impact of lower mark to market losses on economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as discussed in more detail below and lower losses from risk management and trading activities primarily due to favorable changes in regional power prices  and price volatility 
these increases were partially offset by a lower level of origination gains in compared to the lower level of origination gains is primarily due to higher individually significant gains on contracts in that had a positive impact in that period 
changing forward prices result in shifting value between accrual contracts and the associated mark to market positions of certain contracts in new england that contain fuel adjustment clauses and gas transportation contract hedges  producing a timing difference in the recognition of earnings on these transactions 
these mark to market hedges are economically effective  however  they do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
as a result  we recorded million of pre tax losses in  million of pre tax gains in  and pre tax losses of million in these mark to market gains and losses will be offset as we realize the related accrual load serving positions in cash 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities our mark to market energy assets and liabilities are comprised of derivative contracts 
while some of our mark to market contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we discuss our modeling techniques later in this section 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets  noncurrent assets  total assets  current liabilities noncurrent liabilities total liabilities  net mark to market energy asset the following are the primary sources of the change in net mark to market energy asset during and in millions fair value beginning of year changes in fair value recorded in earnings origination gains unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total changes in fair value recorded in earnings contracts acquired changes in value of exchange listed futures and options net change in premiums on options other changes in fair value fair value at end of year changes in the net mark to market energy asset that affected earnings were as follows origination gains represent the initial unrealized fair value at the time these contracts are executed to the extent permitted by applicable accounting rules 
unrealized changes in fair value represent unrealized changes in commodity prices  the volatility of options on commodities  the time value of options  and other valuation adjustments 
changes in valuation techniques represent improvements in estimation techniques  including modeling and other statistical enhancements used to value our portfolio to reflect more accurately the economic value of our contracts 
reclassification of settled contracts to realized represents the portion of previously unrealized amounts settled during the period and recorded as realized revenues 
the net mark to market energy asset also changed due to the following items recorded in accounts other than in our consolidated statements of income contracts acquired represents the initial fair value of acquired derivative contracts recorded in mark to market energy assets 
changes in value of exchange listed futures and options are adjustments to remove unrealized revenue from exchange traded contracts that are included in risk management revenues 
the fair value of these contracts is recorded in accounts receivable rather than mark to market energy assets in our consolidated balance sheets because these amounts are settled through our margin account with a third party broker 
net changes in premiums on options reflects the accounting for premiums on options purchased as an increase in the net mark to market energy asset and premiums on options sold as a decrease in the net mark to market energy asset 
the settlement terms of our net mark to market energy asset and sources of fair value as of december  are as follows settlement term thereafter fair value in millions prices provided by external sources prices based on models total net mark to market energy asset includes contracts actively quoted and contracts valued from other external sources 
we manage our mark to market risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract 
accordingly  we record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based upon the commodity eg  electricity or gas  the product eg  electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours  the delivery location eg  by region  the risk profile eg  forward or option  and the delivery period eg  by month and year 
consistent with our risk management practices  we have presented the information in the table above based upon the ability to obtain reliable prices for components of the risks in our contracts from external sources rather than on a contract by contract basis 
thus  the portion of long term contracts that is valued using external price sources is presented under the caption prices provided by external sources 
this is consistent with how we manage our risk  and we believe it provides the best indication of the basis for the valuation of our portfolio 
since we manage our risk on a portfolio basis rather than contract by contract  it is not practicable to determine separately the portion of long term contracts that is included in each valuation category 
we describe the commodities  products  and delivery periods included in each valuation category in detail below 
the amounts for which fair value is determined using prices provided by external sources represent the portion of forward  swap  and option contracts for which price quotations are available through brokers or over the counter transactions 
the term for which such price information is available varies by commodity  region  and product 
the fair values included in this category are the following portions of our contracts forward purchases and sales of electricity during peak and off peak hours for delivery terms primarily through  but up to  depending upon the region  options for the purchase and sale of electricity during peak hours for delivery terms through  depending upon the region  forward purchases and sales of electric capacity for delivery terms primarily through  but up to  depending on the region  forward purchases and sales of natural gas  coal  and oil for delivery terms through  and options for the purchase and sale of natural gas  coal  and oil for delivery terms through the remainder of the net mark to market energy asset is valued using models 
the portion of contracts for which such techniques are used includes standard products for which external prices are not available and customized products that are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
modeling techniques include estimating the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms and incorporate  where appropriate  option pricing models and statistical and simulation procedures 
inputs to the models include observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlation of energy commodity prices  and expected generation profiles of specific regions 
additionally  we incorporate counterparty specific credit quality and factors for market price and volatility uncertainty and other risks in our valuation 
the inputs and factors used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimates 
the electricity  fuel  and other energy contracts we hold have varying terms to maturity  ranging from contracts for delivery the next hour to contracts with terms of ten years or more 
because an active  liquid electricity futures market comparable to that for other commodities has not developed  the majority of contracts used in the wholesale marketing and risk management operation are direct contracts between market participants and are not exchange traded or financially settling contracts that can be readily liquidated in their entirety through an exchange or other market mechanism 
consequently  we and other market participants generally realize the value of these contracts as cash flows become due or payable under the terms of the contracts rather than through selling or liquidating the contracts themselves 
consistent with our risk management practices  the amounts shown in the table on the previous page as being valued using prices from external sources include the portion of long term contracts for which we can obtain reliable prices from external sources 
the remaining portions of these long term contracts are shown in the table as being valued using models 
in order to realize the entire value of a long term contract in a single transaction  we would need to sell or assign the entire contract 
if we were to sell or assign any of our long term contracts in their entirety  we may not realize the entire value reflected in the table 
however  based upon the nature of the wholesale marketing and risk management operation  we expect to realize the value of these contracts  as well as any contracts we may enter into in the future to manage our risk  over time as the contracts and related hedges settle in accordance with their terms 
we do not expect to realize the value of these contracts and related hedges by selling or assigning the contracts themselves in total 
the fair values in the table represent expected future cash flows based on the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of december  and could change significantly as a result of future changes in these factors 
additionally  because the depth and liquidity of the power markets vary substantially between regions and time periods  the prices used to determine fair value could be affected significantly by the volume of transactions executed 
management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
risk management assets and liabilities we record derivatives that qualify for designation as hedges under sfas no 
in risk management assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our risk management assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets  noncurrent assets total assets  current liabilities noncurrent liabilities  total liabilities  net risk management asset the significant increases in our gross risk management assets and liabilities were due primarily to higher commodity prices during these price increases resulted in larger positions with individual counterparties which must be recorded gross in our balance sheet unless a legal right of offset exists 
the significant increase in our net risk management asset was due primarily to a contract that was previously designated as a cash flow hedge that we elected to de designate and to which the normal purchase and normal sales election was applied 
at the point of de designation  the fair value of the contract that was previously recorded in risk management liabilities was reclassified to unamortized energy contract liabilities 
these increases in our net risk management asset were partially offset by the assumption of below market power sale agreements in connection with a customer contract restructuring 
we discuss the de designation of the cash flow hedge in more detail on the next page 
we discuss the customer contract restructuring transaction in more detail in note unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balance of nonderivative energy contracts that we acquired or derivatives designated as normal purchases and normal sales that we had previously recorded as mark to market energy assets and liabilities or risk management assets and liabilities 
our unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets noncurrent assets total assets current liabilities noncurrent liabilities  total liabilities  during  we acquired several pre existing nonderivative contracts that had been originated by other parties in prior periods when market prices were lower than current levels 
upon acquisition  we received approximately million in cash and other consideration and recorded a liability in unamortized energy contracts 
in addition  during  we designated as normal purchases and normal sales contracts that we had previously recorded as cash flow hedges in risk management liabilities 
this change in designation resulted in a reclassification of million from risk management liabilities to unamortized energy contracts 
since the original forecasted transaction is still probable of occurring  the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income upon de designation of the hedged position will remain and be amortized along with the unamortized energy contract liability 
the de designation and reclassification had no impact on our earnings 
other in millions revenues our merchant energy business holds up to a voting interest in operating domestic energy projects that consist of electric generation  fuel processing  or fuel handling facilities 
of these projects  are qualifying facilities that receive certain exemptions based on the facilities energy source or the use of a cogeneration process 
earnings from our investments were million in  million in  and million in other revenues decreased million in compared to mostly due to an increased incentive fee and a deferred contingent transaction fee received from our synthetic fuel facilities located in virginia and west virginia that had a favorable impact in the increase in revenues in compared to is primarily due to higher equity in earnings related to our minority investment in a facility that produces synthetic fuel from coal 
this increase included million of revenues related to an increased incentive fee and a deferred contingent transaction fee 
at december   our investment in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects consisted of the following book value at december  in millions project type coal hydroelectric geothermal biomass fuel processing solar total we believe the current market conditions for our equity method investments that own geothermal  coal  hydroelectric  and fuel processing projects provide sufficient positive cash flows to recover our investments 
we continuously monitor issues that potentially could impact future profitability of these investments  including environmental and legislative initiatives 
we discuss certain risks and uncertainties in more detail in our forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
however  should future events cause these investments to become uneconomic  our investments in these projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
the ability to recover our costs in our equity method investments that own biomass and solar projects is partially dependent upon subsidies from the state of california 
under the california public utility act  subsidies currently exist in that the california public utilities commission cpuc requires load serving entities to identify a separate rate component to be collected from customers to fund the development of renewable resources technologies  including solar  biomass  and wind facilities 
in addition  legislation in california requires that each load serving entity increase its total procurement of eligible renewable energy resources by at least one percent per year so that of its retail sales are procured from eligible renewable energy resources by the cpuc accelerated the deadline for compliance to the legislation also requires the california energy commission to award supplemental energy payments to load serving entities to cover above market costs of renewable energy 
given the need for electric power and the desire for renewable resource technologies  we believe california will continue to subsidize the use of renewable energy to make these projects economical to operate 
however  should the california legislation fail to adequately support the renewable energy initiatives  our equity method investments in these types of projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
 and any losses recognized could be material 
if our strategy were to change from an intent to hold to an intent to sell for any of our equity method investments in qualifying facilities or power projects  we would need to adjust their book value to fair value  and that adjustment could be material 
if we were to sell these investments in the current market  we may have losses that could be material 
operating expenses our merchant energy business operating expenses increased million in compared to mostly due to the following an increase of million at our wholesale marketing and risk management operation due to an increase in compensation and benefit costs including our expanding gas and coal operations  an increase of million from ginna  which was acquired in june  an increase of million at our retail operation primarily related to a million increase in uncollectible expenses and a million increase in aggregator fees  an increase of million at our gas fired generating facilities primarily due to increased corporate overhead expenses  and an increase of million at calvert cliffs primarily due to an increase in corporate overhead expenses  partially offset by fewer employees and a shorter refueling outage in these increases in expense were partially offset by lower operating expenses of million at nine mile point primarily due to lower refueling outage expenses and a lower number of employees and contractors

base rates in april  bge filed an application for a million annual increase in its gas base rates 
the maryland psc issued an order in december granting bge an annual increase of million 
certain parties to the proceeding have sought judicial review and maryland psc rehearing of the decision 
bge will not seek review of any aspect of the order 
we cannot provide assurance that a court will not reverse any aspect of the order or that it will not remand certain issues to the maryland psc 
weather normalization the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our gas distribution revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns on our gas distribution volumes 
this means our monthly gas distribution revenues are based on weather that is considered normal for the month and  therefore  are not affected by actual weather conditions 
gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc as described in note however  under the market based rates mechanism approved by the maryland psc  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers 
customers who do not purchase gas from bge are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
however  these customers are charged base rates to recover the costs bge incurs to deliver their gas through our distribution system  and are included in the gas distribution volume revenues 
gas cost adjustment revenues increased in compared to because we sold more gas at higher prices 
gas cost adjustment revenues increased in compared to because we sold gas at a higher price partially offset by less gas sold 
off system sales off system gas sales are low margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas outside our service territory 
off system gas sales  which occur after bge satisfied its customers demand  are not subject to gas cost adjustments 
the maryland psc approved an arrangement for part of the margin from off system sales to benefit customers through reduced costs and the remainder to be retained by bge which benefits shareholders 
changes in off system sales do not significantly impact earnings 
revenues from off system gas sales increased in compared to because we sold more gas at higher prices 
revenues from off system gas sales decreased in compared to mostly because of less gas sold 
gas purchased for resale expenses gas purchased for resale expenses include the cost of gas purchased for resale to our customers and for off system sales 
these costs do not include the cost of gas purchased by delivery service only customers 
gas purchased for resale expenses increased in compared to because we purchased more gas at higher prices 
gas purchased for resale expenses increased in as compared to mostly because of higher gas prices partially offset by less gas sold 
gas operations and maintenance expenses regulated gas operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to mostly due to higher compensation and benefit costs and the impact of inflation on other costs

while our intent is to dispose of these remaining non core assets  market conditions and other events beyond our control may affect the actual sale of these assets 
in addition  a future decline in the fair value of these assets could result in losses that could have a material impact on our financial results 
consolidated nonoperating income and expenses other income other income increased million in compared to primarily because of higher interest and investment income due to a higher cash balance and higher decommissioning trust asset earnings and gains on the sales of land at bge

total fixed charges for bge decreased million during compared to mostly because of a lower level of debt outstanding 
income taxes the differences in income taxes result from a combination of the changes in income and the impact of the recognition of tax credits on the effective tax rate 
we include an analysis of the changes in the effective tax rate in note the internal revenue code provides for a phase out of synthetic fuel tax credits if average annual wellhead oil prices increase above certain levels 
each year  we are required to compare average annual wellhead oil prices per barrel as published by the internal revenue service irs reference price to a gross national product inflation adjusted oil price for the year  also published by the irs 
the reference price is determined based on wellhead prices for all domestic oil production as published by the energy information administration 
for the twelve months ended december   we estimate that the reference price averaged approximately per barrel lower than the nymex price for light  sweet crude oil 
for  we estimate the credit reduction would begin if the reference price exceeds approximately per barrel and would be fully phased out if the reference price exceeds approximately per barrel 
if oil prices remain at high levels  a portion of our synthetic fuel tax credits could be phased out in and market forwards and volatilities as of mid february would indicate a tax credit phase out approximately million in we actively monitor and manage our exposure to synthetic fuel tax credit phase out as part of our ongoing hedging activities 
in addition  we may reduce synthetic fuel production depending on our expectation of the level of tax credit phase out 
the objective of these activities is to reduce the potential losses we could incur if the reference price in a year exceeds a level triggering a phase out of synthetic fuel tax credits 
while we believe the production and sale of synthetic fuel from all of our synthetic fuel facilities meet the conditions to qualify for tax credits under the irc  we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any future challenge by the irs  legislative or regulatory action  oil prices  the effectiveness of our hedging program  or the ultimate impact of such events on the synthetic fuel tax credits that we have claimed to date or expect to claim in the future  but the impact could be material to our financial results 
pension expense our actual return on our qualified pension plan assets was for the year ended december  in  we assumed an expected return on pension plan assets of for the purpose of computing annual net periodic pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
differences between actual and expected returns are deferred along with other actuarial gains and losses and reflected in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
expected and actual returns on pension assets also are affected by plan contributions 
effective in  we have reduced our assumed expected return on pension plan assets from to based on a fundamental analysis utilizing expected long term returns applied to our targeted asset allocation 
effective december   we also changed the mortality table we are utilizing to determine our benefit obligation and annual expense to reflect more current life expectancy experience 
the combined impact of these changes will increase and subsequent year pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
we expect to contribute million to our pension plans in  even though there is no required irs minimum contribution for at december   we recorded an after tax charge to equity of million as a result of increasing our additional minimum pension liability 
we discuss our pension plans in more detail in note financial condition cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows by business segment  as well as our consolidated cash flows for   and segment cash flows consolidated cash flows merchant regulated other in millions operating activities net income non cash adjustments to net income changes in working capital pension and postemployment benefits other net cash provided by operating activities investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment contract and portfolio acquisitions asset acquisitions and business combinations  net of cash acquired investment in nuclear decommissioning trust fund securities proceeds from nuclear decommissioning trust funds securities net proceeds from sale of discontinued operations sale of investments and other assets issuances of loans receivable other investments net cash used in provided by investing activities cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities financing activities net repayment issuance of debt proceeds from issuance of common stock common stock dividends paid proceeds from contract and portfolio acquisitions other net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents items are not allocated to the business segments because they are managed for the company as a whole 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to  million in net income was higher by million in compared to non cash adjustments to net income were million lower in compared to the decrease in non cash adjustments to net income was primarily due to the reclassification of million of proceeds from derivative power sales contracts as financing activities under sfas no 
 amendment of fasb statement no 
on derivative and hedging activities and million related to the impact of discontinued operations 
changes in working capital had a negative impact of million on cash flow from operations in compared to a negative impact of million in the decrease of million was due to a million unfavorable change in working capital primarily related to our accounts receivable  accounts payable  and fuel stocks mostly due to higher commodity prices  increased value of emissions credits  and business growth 
this was partially offset by an increase of million of net cash collateral received  which was also due to higher commodity prices 
cash provided by operating activities was  million in compared to  million in non cash adjustments to net income were million lower in compared to the decrease in non cash adjustments to net income was primarily due to the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and eitf in  which had the effect of reducing net income in but were non cash transactions 
this decrease in non cash adjustments to net income was offset in part by the following increases in non cash adjustments in higher depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations of million  the loss on sale of discontinued operations of million  a decrease in the net gain on sales of investments and other assets of million primarily due to the sale of financial and real estate investments in we adjust net income to exclude these gains and reflect the proceeds from these sales in the investing activities sections  and an increase in deferred income taxes of million 
changes in working capital had a negative impact of million on cash flow from operations in compared to a negative impact of million in the million decrease in cash due to working capital changes was primarily due to the following uses of cash in compared to a decline in working capital related to accrued taxes of approximately million in compared to due to higher income tax payments in compared to refunds of taxes in and due to the timing of income tax accruals in compared to  a million unfavorable change in working capital relating to our accounts receivable and accounts payable primarily due to increased volumes associated with our merchant energy business and the termination of an accounts receivable securitization program in  and an unfavorable change of approximately million relating to fuel stocks during primarily due to higher gas and coal prices  which affected inventory levels at bge and our merchant energy business

this increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a reduction in proceeds from issuances of common stock  an increase in cash used for repayments of debt  and higher dividend payments in compared to cash provided by financing activities decreased million in compared to mostly due to lower issuance of net debt in compared to  partially offset by higher proceeds from common stock issuances 
contract and portfolio acquisitions during and  our merchant energy business acquired several pre existing energy purchase and sale agreements  which generated significant cash flows at the inception of the contracts 
these agreements had contract prices that differed from market prices at closing  which resulted in cash payments from the counterparty at the acquisition of the contract 
we received million in and million in for various contract and portfolio acquisitions 
we reflect the underlying contracts on a gross basis as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets depending on whether they were at above or below market prices at closing  therefore  we have also reflected them on a gross basis in cash flows from investing and financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows as follows year ended december  in millions financing activities proceeds from contract and portfolio acquisitions investing activities contract and portfolio acquisitions cash flows from contract and portfolio acquisitions we record the proceeds we receive to acquire energy purchase and sale agreements as a financing cash inflow because it constitutes a prepayment for a portion of the market price of energy  which we will buy or sell over the term of the agreements and does not represent a cash inflow from current period operating activities 
for those acquired contracts that are derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract with the counterparties as financing cash inflows in accordance with sfas no 
we discuss certain of these contract and portfolio acquisitions in more detail in note and note security ratings independent credit rating agencies rate constellation energy s and bge s fixed income securities 
the ratings indicate the agencies assessment of each company s ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends  and principal on these securities 
these ratings affect how much it will cost each company to sell these securities 
the better the rating  the lower the cost of the securities to each company when they sell them 
the factors that credit rating agencies consider in establishing constellation energy s and bge s credit ratings include  but are not limited to  cash flows  liquidity  business risk profile  and the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization

we also have available sources from commercial paper issuances  issuances of long term debt and equity  leases  and other financing activities 
the projects that our merchant energy business develops typically require substantial capital investment 
many of the qualifying facilities and independent power projects that we have an interest in are financed primarily with non recourse debt that is repaid from the project s cash flows 
this debt is collateralized by interests in the physical assets  major project contracts and agreements  cash accounts and  in some cases  the ownership interest in that project

contractual payment obligations and committed amounts we enter into various agreements that result in contractual payment obligations in connection with our business activities 
these obligations primarily relate to our financing arrangements such as long term debt  preference stock  and operating leases  purchases of capacity and energy to support the growth in our merchant energy business activities  and purchases of fuel and transportation to satisfy the fuel requirements of our power generating facilities 
our total contractual payment obligations as of december   increased billion compared to primarily due to an increase in fuel and transportation obligations 
the increase in fuel and transportation obligations was mostly due to increased gas prices due to supply and demand imbalances and hurricane related disruptions in the gulf coast and new contracts related to gas and nuclear fuel procurement

interest on variable rate debt is included based on the december  forward curve for interest rates 
our operating lease commitments include future payment obligations under certain power purchase agreements as discussed further in note contracts to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms 
amounts related to certain purchase obligations are based on future purchase expectations which may differ from actual purchases 
our contractual obligations for purchased capacity and energy are shown on a gross basis for certain transactions  including both the fixed payment portions of tolling contracts and estimated variable payments under unit contingent power purchase agreements 
we have recorded million of liabilities related to purchased capacity and energy obligations at december  in our consolidated balance sheets 
amounts related to postretirement and postemployment benefits are for unfunded plans and reflect present value amounts consistent with the determination of the related liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as discussed in note the table below presents our contingent obligations 
our contingent obligations increased billion during  primarily due to the issuance of additional letters of credit and guarantees by the parent company for subsidiary obligations to third parties in support of the growth of our merchant energy business 
these amounts do not represent incremental consolidated constellation energy obligations  rather  they primarily represent parental guarantees of certain subsidiary obligations to third parties 
our calculation of the fair value of subsidiary obligations covered by the  million of parent company guarantees was  million at december  accordingly  if the parent company was required to fund subsidiary obligations  the total amount based on december  market prices is  million

pending merger with fpl group  inc in connection with the merger agreement with fpl group  there are certain contingencies relating to termination fees 
we discuss these contingencies in note in addition  as a result of the change in control provisions in our long term incentive plans  we will be required to pay cash of approximately million based on estimated fair value of outstanding awards at december  to settle certain stock based compensation awards if we complete our pending merger with fpl group 
we discuss our long term incentive plans in more detail in note liquidity provisions in many cases  customers of our merchant energy business rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy 
a decline below investment grade by constellation energy would negatively impact the business prospects of that operation 
we regularly review our liquidity needs to ensure that we have adequate facilities available to meet collateral requirements 
this includes having liquidity available to meet margin requirements for our wholesale marketing and risk management operation and our retail competitive supply activities 
we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require additional collateral upon credit rating decreases in the senior unsecured debt of constellation energy 
decreases in constellation energy s credit ratings would not trigger an early payment on any of our credit facilities 
under counterparty contracts related to our wholesale marketing and risk management operation  we are obligated to post collateral if constellation energy s senior unsecured credit ratings declined below established contractual levels 
based on contractual provisions at december   we estimate that if constellation energy s senior unsecured debt were downgraded we would have the following additional collateral obligations credit ratings downgraded to incremental obligations cumulative obligations in millions bbb baa below investment grade   based on market conditions and contractual obligations at the time of a downgrade  we could be required to post collateral in an amount that could exceed the amounts specified above  which could be material 
we assess the risk of being downgraded to below investment grade as remote 
however  we actively monitor our collateral obligations and liquidity 
we discuss our credit facilities in the available sources of funding section 
the credit facilities of constellation energy and bge have limited material adverse change clauses that only consider a material change in financial condition and are not directly affected by decreases in credit ratings 
if these clauses are invoked  the lending institutions can decline to make new advances or issue new letters of credit  but cannot accelerate the payment of existing amounts outstanding 
the long term debt indentures of constellation energy and bge do not contain material adverse change clauses or financial covenants 
certain credit facilities of constellation energy contain a provision requiring constellation energy to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratios as defined in the credit agreements were no greater than 
certain credit agreements of bge contain provisions requiring bge to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratio for bge as defined in these credit agreements was 
at december   no amount was outstanding under these agreements 
failure by constellation energy  or bge  to comply with these provisions could result in the acceleration of the maturity of the debt outstanding under these facilities 
the credit facilities of constellation energy contain usual and customary cross default provisions that apply to defaults on debt by constellation energy and certain subsidiaries over a specified threshold 
certain bge credit facilities also contain usual and customary cross default provisions that apply to defaults on debt by bge over a specified threshold 
the indentures pursuant to which bge has issued and outstanding mortgage bonds and subordinated debentures provide that a default under any debt instrument issued under the relevant indenture may cause a default of all debt outstanding under such indenture 
constellation energy also provides credit support to calvert cliffs  nine mile point  and ginna to ensure these plants have funds to meet expenses and obligations to safely operate and maintain the plants 
as discussed in the regulation by the maryland psc section  the maryland psc and the maryland general assembly are considering proposals to defer recovery of costs to be incurred by bge to provide residential polr service beginning july any decision to defer or limit recovery of such costs could have a material impact on our  or bge s  liquidity 
we discuss our short term credit facilities in note  long term debt in note  lease requirements in note  and commitments and guarantees in note off balance sheet arrangements for financing and other business purposes  we utilize certain off balance sheet arrangements that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
such arrangements do not represent a significant part of our activities or a significant ongoing source of financing 
we use these arrangements when they enable us to obtain financing or execute commercial transactions on favorable terms 
as of december   we have no material off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees with third parties that are subject to the initial recognition and measurement requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  derivative instruments indexed to our common stock  and classified as equity  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services 
we discuss our guarantees in note and our significant variable interests in note market risk we are exposed to various risks  including  but not limited to  energy commodity price and volatility risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  equity price risk  foreign exchange risk  and operations risk 
our risk management program is based on established policies and procedures to manage these key business risks with a strong focus on the physical nature of our business 
this program is predicated on a strong risk management culture combined with an effective system of internal controls 
the audit committee of the board of directors periodically reviews compliance with our risk parameters  limits and trading guidelines and our board of directors has established a value at risk limit 
we have a risk management division that is responsible for monitoring the key business risks  enforcing compliance with risk management policies and risk limits  as well as managing credit risk 
the risk management division reports to the chief risk officer cro who provides regular risk management updates to the audit committee and the board of directors 
we have a risk management committee rmc that is responsible for establishing risk management policies  reviewing procedures for the identification  assessment  measurement and management of risks  and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures 
the rmc meets on a regular basis and is chaired by the vice chairman of constellation energy chairman of constellation energy commodities group  and consists of our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer and chief administrative officer  our executive vice president of corporate strategy and retail competitive supply  the co presidents chief executive officers of constellation energy commodities group  the president of constellation generation group and the chief risk officer 
in addition  the cro coordinates with the risk management committees at the major operating subsidiaries that meet regularly to identify  assess  and quantify material risk issues and to develop strategies to manage these risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain related interest rate swaps 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
in july  to optimize the mix of fixed and floating rate debt  we entered into interest rate swaps relating to million of our long term debt 
these fair value hedges effectively convert our current fixed rate debt to a floating rate instrument tied to the three month london inter bank offered rate 
including the million in interest rate swaps  approximately of our long term debt is floating rate 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date thereafter total fair value at december  dollars in millions long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate fixed rate debt a  average interest rate a amount excludes million of long term debt that contains certain put options under which lenders could potentially require us to repay the debt prior to maturity of which million is classified as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets and in our consolidated statements of capitalization 
commodity risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities 
these risks arise from our ownership and operation of power plants  the load serving activities of bge and our competitive supply operations  and our origination and risk management activities 
we discuss these risks separately for our merchant energy and our regulated businesses below 
merchant energy business our merchant energy business is exposed to various risks in the competitive marketplace that may materially impact its financial results and affect our earnings 
these risks include changes in commodity prices  imbalances in supply and demand  and operations risk 
commodity prices commodity price risk arises from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities  the volatility of commodity prices  and changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
we use such commodities and contracts in our merchant energy business  and if we do not properly hedge the associated financial exposure  this commodity price volatility could affect our earnings 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
additionally  we have fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  and oil prices 
our power generation facilities purchase fuel under contracts or in the spot market 
fuel prices may be volatile and the price that can be obtained from power sales may not change at the same rate or in the same direction as changes in fuel costs 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
supply and demand risk we are exposed to the risk that available sources of supply may differ from the amount of power demanded by our customers under fixed price load serving contracts 
during periods of high demand  our power supplies may be insufficient to serve our customers needs and could require us to purchase additional energy at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand  our power supplies may exceed our customers needs and could result in us selling that excess energy at lower prices 
either of those circumstances could have a negative impact on our financial results 
we are also exposed to variations in the prices and required volumes of natural gas and coal we burn at our power plants to generate electricity 
during periods of high demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may be insufficient and could require us to procure additional fuel at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may exceed our needs  and could result in us selling the excess fuels at lower prices 
either of these circumstances will have a negative impact on our financial results 
operations risk operations risk is the risk that a generating plant will not be available to produce energy and the risks related to physical delivery of energy to meet our customers needs 
if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sales commitments through the operation of other more costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
we purchase power from generating facilities we do not own 
if one or more of those generating facilities were unable to produce electricity due to operational factors  we may be forced to purchase electricity in the wholesale market at higher prices 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our nuclear plants produce electricity at a relatively low marginal cost 
the nine mile point and ginna facilities each sells of output under unit contingent power purchase agreements we have no obligation to provide power if the units are not available to the previous owners 
however  if an unplanned outage were to occur at calvert cliffs during periods when demand was high  we may have to purchase replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet our obligations  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
risk management as part of our overall portfolio  we manage the commodity price risk of our competitive supply activities and our electric generation facilities  including power sales  fuel and energy purchases  emission credits  interest rate and foreign currency risks  weather risk  and the market risk of outages 
in order to manage these risks  we may enter into fixed price derivative or non derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of energy  including forward contracts  which commit us to purchase or sell energy commodities in the future  futures contracts  which are exchange traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument  or to make a cash settlement  at a specific price and future date  swap agreements  which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual notional quantity  and option contracts  which convey the right to buy or sell a commodity  financial instrument  or index at a predetermined price 
the objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on our electric generation operations  fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of our power plants  fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply our load serving customers  and managing our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risks 
the portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s assessment of market  weather  operational  and other factors 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and such variations could be material 
we measure the sensitivity of our wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy contracts to potential changes in market prices using value at risk 
value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price volatility 
we calculate value at risk using a historical variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value 
additionally  we estimate variances and correlation using historical commodity price changes over the most recent rolling three month period 
our value at risk calculation includes all wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy assets and liabilities  including contracts for energy commodities and derivatives that result in physical settlement and contracts that require cash settlement 
the value at risk calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting  primarily our generating facilities and our competitive supply load serving activities 
we manage these risks by monitoring our fuel and energy purchase requirements and our estimated contract sales volumes compared to associated supply arrangements 
we also engage in hedging activities to manage these risks 
we describe those risks and our hedging activities earlier in this section 
the value at risk amounts below represent the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of our wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy assets and liabilities over one and ten day holding periods 
total wholesale value at risk for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  ten day holding period year end average high low based on a confidence interval  we would expect a one day change in the fair value of the portfolio greater than or equal to the daily value at risk approximately once in every days 
in  we experienced one instance where the actual daily mark to market change in portfolio value exceeded the predicted value at risk 
on average  we expect to experience a change in value to our portfolio greater than our value at risk approximately three times in a calendar year 
however  published market studies conclude that exceeding daily value at risk less than seven times in a one year period is considered consistent with a confidence interval 
the table above is the value at risk associated with our wholesale marketing and risk management operation s mark to market energy assets and liabilities  including both trading and non trading activities 
we experienced higher value at risk for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to higher commodity prices 
the following table details our value at risk for the trading portion of our wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy assets and liabilities over a one day holding period at a confidence level for and wholesale trading value at risk for the year ended december  in millions average high we experienced higher value at risk for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   for the trading portion of our wholesale trading portfolio due to increased commodity prices  volatility  and trading activity 
our trading positions can be used to manage the commodity price risk of our competitive supply activities and our generation facilities 
we also engage in trading activities for profit 
these activities are managed through daily value at risk and stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines 
due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the value at risk calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure 
additionally  actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method 
as a result  actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated value at risk  and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
regulated electric business bge s residential base rates are frozen for a six year period ending june   and its commercial and industrial base rates were frozen for a four year period that ended june  the commodity and transmission components of rates are frozen for different time periods depending on the customer type and service options selected by customers 
our wholesale marketing and risk management operation provides bge of the energy and capacity to meet its residential standard offer service obligations through june  bidding to supply bge s standard offer service to commercial and industrial customers  and to residential customers beyond june   will occur from time to time through a competitive bidding process approved by the maryland psc 
our wholesale marketing and risk management operation is supplying a portion of bge s standard offer service obligation to commercial and industrial customers 
we discuss standard offer service and the impact on base rates in more detail in item business electric business section 
bge may receive performance assurance collateral from suppliers to mitigate suppliers credit risks in certain circumstances 
performance assurance collateral is designed to protect bge s potential exposure over the term of the supply contracts and will fluctuate to reflect changes in market prices 
in addition to the collateral provisions  there are supplier step up provisions  where other suppliers can step in if the early termination of a full requirements service agreement with a supplier should occur  as well as specific mechanisms for bge to otherwise replace defaulted supplier contracts 
all costs incurred by bge to replace the supply contract are to be recovered from the defaulting supplier or from customers through rates 
finally  bge s exposure to uncollectible expense or credit risk from customers for the commodity portion of the bill is covered by the administrative fee included in provider of last resort rates 
regulated gas business our regulated gas business may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program 
we discuss this further in note at december  and  our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk  primarily through our merchant energy business 
credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparties nonperformance 
we evaluate the credit risk of our wholesale marketing and risk management operation and our retail competitive supply activities separately as discussed below 
wholesale credit risk we measure wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative transactions both mark to market and accrual adjusted for amounts owed to or due from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
we monitor and manage the credit risk of our wholesale marketing and risk management operation through credit policies and procedures which include an established credit approval process  daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits  the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  or prepayment arrangements  and the use of master netting agreements 
as of december  and  the credit portfolio of our wholesale marketing and risk management operation had the following public credit ratings at december  rating investment grade non investment grade not rated includes counterparties with an investment grade rating by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
if split rating exists  the lower rating is used 
our exposure to unrated counterparties was billion at december  compared to million at december  this increase was mostly due to the growth in our merchant energy business  particularly with natural gas and international coal customers that do not have public credit ratings 
although not rated  a majority of these counterparties are considered investment grade equivalent based on our internal credit ratings 
we utilize internal credit ratings to evaluate the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers  including those companies that do not have public credit ratings 
based on internal credit ratings  approximately million or of the exposure to unrated counterparties was rated investment grade equivalent at december  and approximately million or was rated investment grade equivalent at december  the following table provides the breakdown of the credit quality of our wholesale credit portfolio based on our internal credit ratings 
at december  investment grade equivalent non investment grade a portion of our total wholesale credit risk is related to transactions that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
these transactions primarily consist of open positions from our wholesale marketing and risk management operation that are accounted for using mark to market accounting  as well as amounts owed by wholesale counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid 
the following table highlights the credit quality and exposures related to these activities rating total exposure before credit collateral credit collateral net exposure number of counterparties greater than of net exposure net exposure of counterparties greater than of net exposure dollars in millions investment grade   split rating non investment grade internally rated investment grade internally rated non investment grade total   our net exposure to investment grade counterparties and internally rated investment grade counterparties increased million compared to december  primarily as a result of higher commodity prices 
due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity our wholesale marketing and risk management operation had contracted for  we could incur a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and we were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  our credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  that we would have to make to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
retail credit risk we are exposed to retail credit risk through our competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities which serve commercial and industrial companies 
retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations 
this risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer s accounts receivable balance  as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer 
retail credit risk is managed through established credit policies  monitoring customer exposures  and the use of credit mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements 
our retail credit portfolio is well diversified with no significant company or industry concentrations 
during  we did not experience a material change in the credit quality of our retail credit portfolio compared to retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
foreign currency risk our merchant energy business is exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this foreign currency risk arises from our activities in countries where we transact in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  our exposure to foreign currency risk was not material 
however  we expect our foreign currency exposure to grow due to our canadian presence and international coal operations 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk using a comprehensive foreign currency hedging program 
while we cannot predict currency fluctuations  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate risk could be material 
equity price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets primarily through our pension plan assets  our nuclear decommissioning trust funds  and trust assets securing certain executive benefits 
we are required by the nrc to maintain externally funded trusts for the costs of decommissioning our nuclear power plants 
we discuss our nuclear decommissioning trust funds in more detail in note a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million reduction in the fair value of our financial investments that are classified as trading or available for sale securities 
in  our actual return on pension plan assets was million due to advances in the markets in which plan assets are invested 
we describe our financial investments in more detail in note  and our pension plans in note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item with respect to market risk is set forth in item of part ii of this form k under the heading market risk
