key strategies and challenges electric and natural gas distribution strategy provide competitively priced energy to customers while working with them to ensure efficient usage 
both the electric and natural gas distribution segments continually seek opportunities for growth and expansion of their customer base through extensions of existing operations and through selected acquisitions of companies and properties at prices that will provide an opportunity for the company to earn a competitive return on investment 
the natural gas distribution segment also continues to pursue growth by expanding its level of energy related services 
challenges both segments are subject to extensive regulation in the state jurisdictions where they conduct operations with respect to costs and permitted returns on investment as well as subject to certain operational regulations at the federal level 
the ability of these segments to grow through acquisitions is subject to significant competition from other energy providers 
in addition  as to the electric business  the ability of this segment to grow its service territory and customer base is affected by significant competition from other energy providers  including rural electric cooperatives 
construction services strategy provide a competitive return on investment while operating in a competitive industry by building new and strengthening existing customer relationships  effectively controlling costs including taking advantage of synergies  recruiting  developing and retaining talented employees  focusing business development efforts on project areas that will permit higher margins  and properly managing risk 
this segment continuously seeks opportunities to expand through strategic acquisitions 
challenges this segment operates in highly competitive markets  with many jobs subject to competitive bidding 
maintenance of effective cost controls and retention of key personnel are ongoing challenges 
pipeline and energy services strategy leverage the segment s existing expertise in energy infrastructure  services and technologies to increase market share and profitability through optimization of existing operations  internal growth  and acquisitions of energy related assets and companies 
incremental and new growth opportunities include access to new sources of natural gas for storage  gathering and transportation services  expansion of existing gathering and transmission facilities  incremental expansion of the capacity of the grasslands pipeline to allow customers access to more liquid and potentially higher price markets  and pursuit of new markets for the segment s locating and tracking technology business 
challenges energy price volatility  natural gas basis differentials  regulatory requirements  recruitment and retention of a skilled and reliable workforce  increased competition from other natural gas pipeline and gathering companies  and establishing and enhancing customer relationships at the location and tracking technology business 
natural gas and oil production strategy apply new technology and leverage existing exploration and production expertise  with a focus on operated properties  to increase production and reserves from existing leaseholds  and to seek additional reserves and production opportunities in new areas to diversify the segment s asset base 
by optimizing existing operations and taking advantage of new and incremental growth opportunities  this segment s goal is to increase both production and reserves over the long term so as to generate competitive returns on investment 
challenges fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  ongoing environmental litigation and administrative proceedings  timely receipt of necessary permits and approvals  recruitment and retention of a skilled and reliable workforce  and increased competition from many of the larger natural gas and oil companies 
construction materials and mining strategy focus on high growth regional markets located near major transportation corridors and metropolitan areas  achieve economic synergies and enhance profitability through vertical integration of the segment s operations  and continue growth through acquisitions 
vertical integration allows the segment to manage operations from aggregate mining to final lay down of concrete and asphalt  with control of and access to adequate quantities of permitted aggregate reserves being significant

challenges price volatility with respect to  and availability of  raw materials such as steel and cement  petroleum price volatility  recruitment and retention of a skilled and reliable workforce  and increased competition from national and international construction materials companies 
in particular  increases in energy prices can affect the profitability of construction jobs 
the segment s strategy is to mitigate this risk through centralized purchasing and negotiation of contract price escalation provisions 
similarly  the segment seeks to minimize its exposure to regional shortages of raw materials through utilization of national purchasing accounts 
independent power production strategy achieve growth through the acquisition  construction and operation of domestic nonregulated electric generation facilities and through international investments in the energy and natural resources sectors 
the segment continues to seek projects with mid to long term agreements with financially stable customers  while maintaining diversity in customers  geographic markets and fuel source 
challenges overall business challenges for this segment include the risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing construction  startup and operation of power plant facilities  changes in energy market pricing  increased competition from other independent power producers  and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency and political risk in the countries where this segment does business
