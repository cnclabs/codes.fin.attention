table of contents the following table presents an overview of our key financial performance indicators table return on average assets return on average equity average equity to asset ratio net interest margin  tax equivalent basis efficiency ratio cash dividend payout ratio our goal is to grow our earning assets while maintaining a high return on equity and strong asset quality 
we will achieve this by emphasizing personalized  quality banking products and services for our customers  by hiring and retaining high performing  experienced branch and administrative personnel and by responding quickly to customer demand and growth opportunities 
we intend to increase penetration in our existing markets and expand into new markets through suitable acquisitions and new branch openings 
we moved our kennewick branch to a permanent location in the tri cities area  which includes the washington cities of richland  kennewick and pasco 
we completed construction of the new  square foot facility  located in richland  in december and opened in january the renamed meadow springs branch is our flagship branch serving all of the tri cities area 
the facility houses a full service bank branch on the first floor and our tri cites business banking team on the second floor 
in order to serve our retail customers more conveniently  the branch features a five lane drive up including two drive up atms 
we began construction of our new pasco branch  which is located next to the trac convention center in pasco 
we expect to open the new branch during the first quarter of the  square foot branch will serve the northwestern tri cities area and will focus on small business relationships and expanding our consumer product base 
it will feature a four lane drive up including two drive up atms 
we also began construction of our new cherry heights branch  which is located west of downtown the dalles and expected to open during the first quarter of the branch will expand our dominant presence in the dalles by providing a more convenient banking alternative to our customers 
it will feature a five lane drive up including two drive up atms and space to be leased to a drive up coffee operator 
in september  we signed an agreement with d l capital funding  inc  an independent commercial real estate loan originator  whose services will be marketed in alliance with the columbia river capital team 
the alliance provides us with greater access to the commercial and multifamily real estate segments 
it also allows us the opportunity to participate in loans that are otherwise in excess of our lending limits 
in december  we modified our organizational and executive reporting structure to improve our credit oversight  to realign our operations group by including loan operations and to centralize our consumer loan process 
these changes realign certain departments to take advantage of similar work processes and allow for cross training 
beginning in  we discontinued our practice of selling mortgage loans into a secondary market while retaining the servicing rights 
under this arrangement  we collected fee income for mortgage loan servicing and reported the mortgage servicing rights as an asset on our balance sheet based on the estimated value of the servicing rights 
due to the modest fee income we earned and the uncertainty of required valuation adjustments on our earnings  we sold our mortgage servicing asset msa during the second quarter of the sale resulted in a gain of  which is included as a component of other non interest income 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  impairment of intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that we consider reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of possible losses associated with the bank s loan portfolio  off balance sheet financial instruments and deposit account overdrafts 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance based on numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  therefore  a significant decrease in real estate values in oregon and washington may cause us to increase the allowance for loan losses 
at december   we had million in goodwill as a result of business combinations 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which requires us to evaluate goodwill for impairment not less than annually and to write down the goodwill if the business unit associated with the goodwill cannot sustain the value attributed to it 
our evaluation of the fair value of goodwill involves a substantial amount of judgment 
we may become party to various legal proceedings 
these matters have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there can also be no assurance that we know  at any point in time  all matters that may be brought against us

table of contents we have applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  compensation costs have been recognized as the difference between the exercise price of each option and the market price of our stock at the date of each grant 
had compensation cost for our   and grants for stock based compensation plans been determined consistent with sfas no 
 our net income and earnings per common share for december    and  would approximate the pro forma amounts shown in the following table table dollars in thousands except per share data net income  as reported deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based methods for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income earnings per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the stock dividend  effective december  the fair value of each option granted has been estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for december   and table dividend yield expected life years years years years expected volatility risk free rate the effects of applying sfas no 
in the pro forma disclosure are not necessarily indicative of future amounts 
recently  the financial accounting standards board fasb announced the release of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this revision will require us to begin recognizing the fair values of stock options granted as compensation cost on the date of grant or over the vesting period 
sfas r will take effect beginning january  as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the actual impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  we do not believe the future impact on earnings will be materially different than what has historically been reported as the pro forma effect to net income included above 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were approximately   and  in  and  respectively

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income  our primary source of operating income  is the difference between interest income  principally from our loan and investment security portfolios  and interest expense  principally on our customer deposits and bank borrowings from other sources  such as trust preferred securities 
like most financial institutions  our net interest income increases as we are able to charge higher interest rates on loans while paying lower interest rates on deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis to total average interest earning assets 
average balances and average rates earned and paid 
the following table presents average balances and interest income or interest expense  with the resulting average yield or rates by category of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities table year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  interest average interest average interest average average income or yields or average income or yields or average income or yields or dollars in thousands balance expense rates balance expense rates balance expense rates interest earning assets loans investment securities taxable securities nontaxable securities total investment securities interest earning balances due from banks federal funds sold total interest earning assets nonearning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking and savings accounts time deposit iras borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits total deposits and borrowed funds other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income tax equivalent net interest income as reported average yield on average earning assets interest expense to average earning assets net interest margin net interest spread non accrual loans and loans held for sale are included in the average balance 
tax exempt income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis at a rate of 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income taxable equivalent basis by total average earning assets 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents total interest earning assets averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the corresponding periods in and growth in average earning assets resulted principally from loan portfolio growth and to a lesser extent increases in interest earning balances with other banks and federal funds sold 
net interest margin measures how well a bank manages its asset and liability pricing and duration 
our tax equivalent net interest margin for each of the years ended december  and was 
approximately basis points of our net interest margin for the year ended december  is attributable to the collection of past due interest 
our net interest margin remained stable during because our average non interest bearing liabilities increased as a percentage of average earnings assets 
our net interest spread decreased because rates on interest bearing liabilities increased 
net interest margin on a quarterly basis increased to from   and at september   june   and march   respectively 
our balance sheet is asset sensitive  meaning that our balance sheet assets reprice  or adjust to market rates  more frequently than our liabilities 
as a result  the eight increases in the federal reserve discount rate during contributed to our increasing net interest margin and net interest income 
increases in net interest income were partially offset by the rising cost of funds due to competitive pricing pressures on our deposit accounts 
our relationship pricing strategy  whereby we selectively offer value priced deposit rates to certain customers  combined with our success at gathering low cost deposits  has minimized increases in our overall cost of funds 
in addition  as our liquidity improved during the third and fourth quarters  we benefited from increasing interest rates and earnings on our federal funds sold 
federal funds interest contributed and basis points  respectively  to our third and fourth quarter net interest margin  compared to basis points for the second quarter and basis points for the first quarter 
for  we expect our net interest margin to compress due to the influence of a flat yield curve  competitive deposit pricing and our need to raise deposits in order to continue to fund loan growth 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents analysis of changes in interest differential 
the following table shows the dollar amount of the increase decrease in our net interest income and expense and attributes such dollar amounts to changes in volume as well as changes in rates 
rate and volume variances have been allocated proportionally between rate and volume changes 
table over over over increase decrease due to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to net net net dollars in thousands volume rate change volume rate change volume rate change interest earning assets loans investment securities taxable securities nontaxable securities balances due from banks federal funds sold total interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking and savings accounts time deposits borrowed funds total net increase decrease in net interest income during  million of the net increase in our net interest income resulted from rising interest rates 
this demonstrates that our balance sheet is asset sensitive  meaning that in a given period of time our interest earning assets mature or reprice more often than our interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses our provision for loan losses represents an expense to establish an adequate allowance for loan losses and deposit account overdrafts 
charges to the provision for loan losses result from our ongoing analysis of possible losses in our loan portfolio 
charges to provision for loan losses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the provision from to is primarily attributable to charge offs during the third and fourth quarters of we charged off approximately  of two commercial loans during the third quarter and  of two commercial loans related to one borrower during the fourth quarter 
although classified as commercial loans  these charged off loans relate to borrowers in the agricultural industry 
the increase in the provision is also partly attributable to overall loan growth  if underlying risk factors remain the same  growth in our loan portfolio results in charges to the provision to cover possible losses in the portfolio 
non interest income non interest income consists of service charges and fees  crb mortgage team revenues  credit card discounts  crb financial services team revenues and gains from the sale of loans  securities and other assets 
crb mortgage team revenues include service release premiums  revenues from the origination and sale of mortgage loans and net revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
crb financial services team revenues include revenues from the sale of investments and financial planning services to our customers 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents non interest income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of and compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   non interest income includes  of gain from the sale of the mortgage servicing asset 
services charges and fees increased  from to  and  from to this slow down in growth resulted from a deposit campaign that waived service charges 
this is consistent with our relationship banking approach because it allows our branch personnel to grow deposits by waiving fees in order to promote long term customer goodwill 
attracting long term non interest bearing deposit relationships also benefits our net interest spread and net interest margin 
in addition  certain deposit accounts include an analysis fee arrangement where we charge fees for account services that are offset by a deposit earnings credit 
because the earnings credit is based on a market interest rate  earnings credits have increased during and slowed the growth of service charges 
crb mortgage team revenues increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  we are no longer engaged in mortgage servicing activities following the sale of the mortgage servicing asset in the second quarter of the increase in crb mortgage team revenues is the result of a reduction in mortgage servicing expenses and an increase in loan production 
crb mortgage team produced loans during the year ended december   compared to loans during the year ended december   a increase 
during  we expect crb mortgage team revenues to trend slightly upwards based on expectations of our strategic plan to hire mortgage loan officers who will have an existing network of loan referrals 
crb financial services team revenues decreased in from due to a volatile stock market and a cautious investment atmosphere that resulted in lower volume and revenue 
during  however  financial services revenues increased over as market conditions improved 
non interest expense non interest expense consists principally of salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  item and statement processing expenses and other non interest expenses 
a measure of our ability to control non interest expenses is the efficiency ratio 
for the year ended december   the efficiency ratio was  as compared to and  in and  respectively 
the efficiency ratio is an important measure of productivity in the banking industry and measures overhead costs as a percentage of total revenues 
the continued improvement in this ratio is due in large part to steady growth in net interest income  with a recent increase in income generation specifically in the area of interest on federal funds sold for non interest expense for was million  as compared to million and million  for and  respectively 
the changes in non interest expense are primarily the result of an increase in salary expense  occupancy expense and other non interest expenses 
these increases are in line with management s expectations when taking into consideration an increase of full time employees during and during  as well as the additional costs invested in new branch openings 
in addition  an adjustment was made to incentive compensation for in anticipation of increased payouts on performance based bonuses due to our strong financial performance 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents income taxes our provision for income taxes totaled million in  million in and million in the provision resulted in effective combined federal and state tax rates of in  in and in our effective tax rates differ from combined estimated statutory rates of principally due to the effect of nontaxable interest income  which is recognized as income for financial statement purposes  but is not taxable 
the effective tax rate for decreased from prior years due to the oregon corporate kicker tax credit  which totaled  for the year ended december  the oregon constitution provides the corporate kicker tax credit in certain years when state revenues exceed forecasted amounts 
we expect our effective tax rate will range between and and may vary depending on our level of participation in state income tax credits 
financial condition table summary balance sheets december  increase decrease dollars in thousands assets federal funds sold investments total loans  net other assets total assets liabilities non interest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits total deposits other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity includes cash and due from banks  property and equipment  accrued interest receivable and intangible goodwill 
includes accrued interest payable and other liabilities 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand at our branches and cash due from other banks  interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold 
cash on hand balances were generally consistent throughout the year 
interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold can fluctuate dramatically on a day to day basis due to cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity and future expected cash flows 
our goal is to maximize our investment of excess cash in interest bearing investments which are readily available to meet our liquidity needs

table of contents investments the following table presents the carrying value of our investment security portfolio as of december   and table december  december  december  dollars in thousands investments available for sale us government obligations municipal securities equity securities investments held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities us government obligations restricted equity securities total investment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 we classify our investments as trading  held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those that we have the intent and ability to hold until they mature or are called 
available for sale securities are those that we may sell if liquidity requirements dictate or if alternative investment opportunities arise 
we determine the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities based on our board of director s approved asset liability policy  our need for liquidity and other factors 
restricted equity securities consist of federal home loan bank and federal agriculture mortgage corporation stock 
these investments are carried at cost and classified as restricted because ownership is restricted and there is no active market for the stock 
during  our investment portfolio decreased million  principally as a result of matured or called securities totaling million  which were partially offset by purchases totaling million 
at december   our investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   the investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities and available for sale securities and held to maturity securities at december  for the years ended december  and  no single investment security equaled or exceeded of our consolidated shareholders equity 
for the year ended december   one investment security totaled of our consolidated shareholders equity 
this investment security  which matured in january  was a federal agency backed discount note structured to earn a higher rate of return than the overnight federal funds rate 
at december   net unrealized losses in our investment portfolio totaled approximately  compared to net unrealized gains of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in unrealized losses is the result of continued interest rate increases that began in june unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses that may be realized 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents at each financial statement date  we assess each investment to determine if impaired investments are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other than temporary based upon the positive and negative evidence available 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  industry analyst reports  credit market conditions and interest rate trends 
a decline in the market value of any security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security

loans our loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address our target loan types and markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  pricing  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and borrowing limitations that apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to crb  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
our policies are reviewed and approved by crb s board of directors 
bank officers are responsible for originating loans in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by our loan administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending and approval authority of the president  the chief credit officer and the chief administrative officer 
the chief credit officer delegates lending and approval authority to other lending officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board of directors  the president or chief credit officer within their delegated authority 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to an approval limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the approval limit of the chief credit officer  and up to a certain limit  are reviewed for approval by the president or chief administrative officer 
loans which exceed this limit are subject to review and approval by the board loan committee 
all loans approved by the board loan committee are reviewed by the full board of directors at regularly scheduled meetings 
our unsecured legal lending limit was million and our real estate secured lending limit was million at december  we rarely originate individual loans for amounts approaching our legal lending limits 
our internal policy establishes a lower lending limit compared to the legal lending limit 
our loan portfolio reflects our efforts to diversify risk across a range of loan types and industries  and thereby complement the markets in which we do business 
loan products include construction  land development and real estate  commercial  consumer  agriculture and credit cards 
our net loan portfolio including loans held for sale at december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million at december  unfunded loan commitments totaled million at december   an increase of million  or compared to december  at december   construction  land development and commercial real estate loans comprised of our loan portfolio  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
we believe this concentration is consistent with our pacific northwest community bank peers  however  we are subject to fluctuations in real estate development markets  as well as to the more widespread economic effects of fluctuating or changing interest rates 
in addition  some loans classified as real estate loans  because borrowings are collateralized by real estate  are used for other purposes such as inventory financing and equipment purchases 
real estate construction loan growth was strong during the third quarter and accelerated during the fourth quarter of our portland loan production office and columbia river capital team have expanded our access to real estate loan markets 
as a result  our loan portfolio grew million during the fourth quarter  million of which was originated by the columbia river capital team in alliance with d l capital funding  inc 
we also participate in non real estate agricultural lending  which comprises approximately of our total loan portfolio 
we employ loan officers who have developed a high level of expertise in underwriting and monitoring agriculture loans 
traditionally  agriculture lending has been neglected due to its unique challenges 
we address these challenges by hiring experienced agricultural lenders and consultants  by diversifying our agricultural loan portfolio across eleven different commodity types and by maintaining preferred lender status with the farm service agency 
this status allows us to participate in farm loan government guarantee programs  which provide guarantees of up to on qualified loans 
approximately of our agricultural loans are guaranteed through this program  however  these guarantees are limited and these loans are not without credit risk 
crb mortgage team originates and funds single family mortgage loans 
these loans are usually committed for sale to mortgage investors and held for less than thirty days 
mortgage loans held for sale are reported under the caption loans held for sale on our balance sheet 
at december   mortgage loans held for sale totaled million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   mortgage loans held for sale longer than thirty days totaled  and consisted of two loans that we expect to sell by the end of february the increase in mortgage loans held for sale resulted from an increase in mortgage production during at december   loans held for sale also includes one columbia river capital team loan totaling million 
we expect to complete the sale of this loan during the first quarter of columbia river capital team occasionally sells commercial real estate loans that it originates 
sometimes these loans are not sold until construction is completed 
due to the somewhat limited market for commercial real estate loans and construction timing issues  these loans are typically held longer than mortgage loans held for sale

the allowance is calculated based on a systematic approach each quarter consistent with the interagency policy statement issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
our methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration all loans in our portfolio using the following three factors loss allocation to groups of loans by internal risk grade loss allocation by loan type loss allocation by historical loss percentage adversely classified and impaired loans are assigned a higher loss percentage than non classified loans 
historically  deposit overdraft losses have been minimal 
we also review current regional and national economic conditions and trends  economic circumstances that may affect our borrowers individually and collectively  and various other factors that we consider appropriate for allocation to specific loans or loan categories 
increases to the allowance occur when we expense amounts to the loan loss provision or when we recover previously charged off loans 
decreases occur when we charge off loans that are deemed uncollectible 
we determine the appropriateness and amount of these charges by assessing the risk potential in our portfolio on an ongoing basis 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents when a loan  or a portion of a loan  is determined to be uncollectible  it is charged off  which means it is removed from the balance sheet and the reduction is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are reflected as increases to the allowance for loan losses 
deposit account overdraft charge offs are accounted for in the same manner 
beginning in  in accordance with financial institution letter fil issued by the fdic  we also include an analysis of demand deposit overdrafts in the calculation for allowance for loan losses 
we assess deposit overdraft risk based on factors developed from our historical loss experience 
historically  deposit overdraft losses have been minimal 
the following table presents our loan loss experience for the periods indicated table years ended december  dollars in thousands loans outstanding at end of period  net of unearned loan fees average loans outstanding for the period allowance for loan losses balance  beginning of year loans charged off commercial real estate real estate construction agriculture consumer loans consumer overdrafts credit card and related accounts total loans charged off recoveries commercial real estate real estate construction agriculture consumer loans consumer overdrafts credit card and related accounts total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses balance  end of period ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans at end of period includes loans held for sale 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses takes into account several factors  including the following key loan quality indicators the ratio of the allowance to total outstanding loans  the ratio of total non performing loans to total loans  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding  and the relative quality of the loan portfolio as measured by the risk rating of each loan 
columbia bancorp 
table of contents generally  a decrease in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total outstanding loans indicates an improvement in overall loan quality 
during  the number and total balance of loans risk rated at the lower quality end of the spectrum have improved significantly 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total outstanding loans at december  falls within our historical range of to during the past five years to 
this ratio measured at december   compared to at december  in our view  the reduction in the allowance as a percentage of total loans is representative of an overall improvement of the risk in our loan portfolio 
the ratio of total non performing loans to total loans of falls slightly outside of our five year historical range of to 
this is primarily the result of three agricultural related loans placed on non accrual status during the fourth quarter of we believe these non accrual loans are isolated events and not representative of an adverse quality trend in the overall loan portfolio 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans at december  also falls within our historical range of to during the past five years to  since during the year ended december   we charged off million and recovered  of loans for a net charge off of million 
the increase in loan charge offs for  as compared to  is primarily attributable to charge offs during the third and fourth quarters 
we charged off approximately  of two commercial loans during the third quarter and  of two commercial loans related to one borrower during the fourth quarter 
net charge offs for  were consistent with our historical experience in view of the growth in our loan portfolio 
as noted above  loans with variable interest rates comprise approximately of our loan portfolio 
as variable rate loan payments increase due to rising interest rates  our borrowers may have difficulty making payments as they come due 
this increase in credit risk may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe our loan underwriting policies and loan officer experience and customer knowledge are significant contributors to our ability to mitigate loan losses 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans on non accrual status  delinquent loans past due greater than days  restructured loans and other real estate owned oreo 
we do not accrue interest on loans for which full payment of principal and interest is not expected  or for which payment of principal or interest has been in default days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
in order to promote better oversight and review of certain loan arrangements  we sometimes place on non accrual status loans that are not past due or that are fully collateralized 
restructured loans are those for which the interest rate or payment schedules were modified from original terms to accommodate the borrower s weakened financial condition 
oreo represents assets acquired through loan foreclosure or recovery activities

table of contents the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for financial holding companies and member banks 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leverage capital 
the regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a corporation has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the following table presents our capital ratios at december  and december   as compared to regulatory minimums for capital adequacy purposes table december  december  regulatory minimum tier i capital total risk based capital leverage ratio liquidity and capital resources we have adopted policies to help maintain liquidity in order to respond to changes in the financial environment and insure sufficient funds are available to meet our anticipated cash demands  which ordinarily come from customer borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals 
generally  our major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  and net cash provided by operating activities 
from time to time  we may also draw upon credit lines with the federal home loan bank of seattle and correspondent banks  as well as brokered certificates of deposit and other wholesale borrowings 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  unpledged securities available for sale and securities held to maturity with maturities occurring within three months 
at december   liquid assets totaled million or of total assets  as compared to million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  at december  and  unused and available lines of credit from fhlb and correspondent banks totaled million and million  respectively 
during  we increased our deposit gathering efforts at the branch level  improving liquidity and allowing us to lessen our reliance on wholesale liabilities such as brokered certificates of deposit and direct certificates of deposit 
federal funds sold increased million  or million on an average balance basis  from december  to december  we will continue our deposit gathering efforts during  however  if loan growth outpaces retail deposit growth  we will utilize wholesale sources to fund loan growth 
the analysis of liquidity also includes a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
cash flows from operating activities include net income of million  which is adjusted for non cash items and increases or decreases in cash due to changes in certain assets and liabilities 
net cash flows from operating activities increased  cash flows from investing activities consists primarily of proceeds from and purchases of securities and the impact of the net growth in loans 
during  net cash flows from investing activities increased million primarily due to a net decrease in loans made to borrowers 
cash flows from financing activities include cash flows associated with deposit accounts and payments to and from shareholders 
net cash flows from financing activities decreased million during  due to a net decrease in cash received from deposits accounts and a net decrease in cash from note payable advances

table of contents at december   we had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of commitments to extend credit to businesses  credit lines available to consumers under credit card and other arrangements and commercial and standby letters of credit 
many of these credit lines will not be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we believe that our sources of liquidity  including million in liquid assets  million in unused lines of credits and the use of brokered or wholesale certificates of deposits  are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
we monitor liquidity on a daily  weekly  monthly and quarterly basis  to insure we have sufficient funds to meet our cash demands 
inflation at this time  management does not consider the long term effects of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  will be material to our financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we utilize financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers  including loan commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit  unused portions of visa credit cards  and commitments to fund mortgage loans 
the increase in off balance sheet items has occurred during the last three years as a result of growth in the loan portfolio 
the table below sets forth the distribution of our contingent liabilities by off balance sheet type 
commitments to extend credit increased primarily due to growth and expansion of commercial real estate construction lending from our central oregon branches

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management in the banking industry  a major risk involves changing interest rates  which can have a significant impact on columbia s profitability 
columbia manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within the guidelines established by its two asset liability committees alco 
columbia has two levels of alco oversight and management  the management alco  which meets monthly and the board alco  which meets quarterly 
the board alco has the responsibility for establishing the tolerances and monitoring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate risk exposure  capital position  liquidity management and the investment portfolio 
the management alco has responsibility to manage the daily activities necessary to ensure compliance with asset liability management policies and tolerances 
the board alco minutes are provided to the board of directors for review and approval 
asset liability management simulation models are used to measure interest rate risk 
the models quantify interest rate risk through simulating forecasted net interest income and the economic value of equity over a month forward looking time horizon under various rate scenarios 
the economic value of equity is defined as the difference between the market value of current assets less the market value of liabilities 
by measuring the change in the present value of equity under different rate scenarios  management is able to identify interest rate risk that may not be evident in simulating changes in the forecasted net interest income 
table below shows the simulated percentage change in forecasted net interest income and the economic value of equity based on changes in the interest rate environment 
the change in interest rates assumes an immediate  parallel and sustained shift in the base interest rate forecast 
through these simulations  management estimates the impact on net interest income and present value of equity based on a and basis point upward and downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
the analysis did not allow rates to fall below zero 
table percent change percent change in net interest in present value change in interest rates income of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points as illustrated in the above table  columbia s balance sheet is currently asset sensitive  meaning that interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period 
therefore  according to the model  net interest income should increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall in an interest rate shift that is parallel across all terms of the yield curve 
this is primarily a result of the concentration of variable rate and short term commercial loans in columbia s portfolio 
the simulation model does not take into account future management actions that could be undertaken  should a change occur in actual market interest rates 
also  certain assumptions underlie modeling simulation results and these assumptions may have significant impact on the results 
these include assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and balance changes of deposit products that do not have stated maturities 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of industry standards and historical pricing behavior and modeled for future expectations 
the model also includes assumptions about changes in the composition or mix of the balance sheet 
the results derived from the simulation model could vary significantly due to external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and unforeseen competitive factors
