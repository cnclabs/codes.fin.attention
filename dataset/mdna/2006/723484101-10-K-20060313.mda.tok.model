item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements and arizona public service company s financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report 
overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
customer growth in aps service territory is about three times the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings 
the acc regulates aps retail electric rates 
the key issue affecting pinnacle west s and aps financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps retail rate proceedings pending before the acc 
as discussed in greater detail in note  aps has pending before the acc a general retail rate case pursuant to which aps is requesting a  or million  increase in its annual retail electricity revenues effective no later than december   an application for an emergency interim rate increase of million  or approximately  to be effective april  the increase would accelerate recovery of the fuel and purchased power component of aps general rate case and is not an additional increase and would be subject to refund  and an application for a temporary rate increase of approximately  through two separate psa surcharges  to recover million in retail fuel and purchased power costs deferred by aps in under the psa 
aps has been operating palo verde unit at reduced power levels since december  due to a non safety related acoustic impact in one of the unit s shutdown cooling lines 
unit is currently operating at approximately power 
aps has concluded after comprehensive analysis that the preferred solution will require unit to undergo an outage of approximately five weeks in order for aps to effect the necessary modifications to the unit 
aps anticipates that unit will begin this outage in the june timeframe 
in addition  an outage for preparatory work of approximately one week  beginning march   will take place prior to this outage 
this preferred solution was initially planned for installation in the spring of aps estimates that  through february   unit s reduced power level has resulted in incremental replacement power costs of approximately million after income taxes  approximately million of which has been incurred since january  based on current forward market energy prices  aps estimates that a operating unit at reduced power levels until the assumed outage in the june timeframe will result in additional incremental replacement power costs of approximately million after income taxes and b the june unit outage will result in additional incremental replacement power costs of approximately million after income taxes 
aps estimates that these reduced power levels and the june unit outage will result in additional psa deferrals of million after tax million pretax in see deferred fuel and purchased power costs below 
suncor  our real estate development subsidiary  has been and is expected to be an important source of earnings and cash flow 
our subsidiary  aps energy services  provides competitive commodity related energy services and energy related products and services to commercial and 
table of contents industrial retail customers in the western united states 
el dorado  our investment subsidiary  owns minority interests in several energy related investments and arizona community based ventures 
pinnacle west energy is our subsidiary that previously owned and operated unregulated generating plants 
pursuant to the acc s april  order in aps rate case  on july   pinnacle west energy transferred the pwec dedicated assets to aps 
see aps rate case in note pinnacle west energy sold its interest in silverhawk to npc on january  as a result pinnacle west energy no longer owns any generating plants and has ceased operations 
we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities 
in the delivery area  we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction 
we plan to expand long term resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability 
see pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results 
pinnacle west consolidated earnings contribution by business segment we have three principal business segments determined by products  services and the regulatory environment our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution  our real estate segment  which consists of suncor s real estate development and investment activities  and our marketing and trading segment  which consists of our competitive energy business activities  including wholesale marketing and trading and aps energy services commodity related energy services 

table of contents the following table summarizes net income for  and dollars in millions regulated electricity real estate marketing and trading other a income from continuing operations discontinued operations net of tax real estate b marketing and trading c other d net income a includes a million after tax gain in related to the sale of a limited partnership interest in the phoenix suns 
b primarily relates to sales of commercial properties 
c see sale of silverhawk below 
d relates to the sale of nac 
pinnacle west consolidated results of operations general throughout the following explanations of our results of operations  we refer to gross margin 
with respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment  gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs 
gross margin is a non gaap financial measure  as defined in accordance with securities and exchange commission rules 
exhibit reconciles this non gaap financial measure to operating income  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses 
in addition  we have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our current period presentation 
sale of silverhawk in june  we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in silverhawk to npc 
as a result of the sale  we recorded an after tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately million in the second quarter of the marketing and trading segment discontinued operations in the chart above include this loss as well as revenues and expenses related to the operations of silverhawk 
the sale was completed on january  
table of contents deferred fuel and purchased power costs the settlement of aps general retail rate case became effective april  as part of the settlement  the acc approved a annual retail rate increase and the psa  which provides mechanisms for adjusting rates to reflect variations in fuel and purchased power costs 
in accordance with the psa  aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system sales margins  and the amount for such costs currently included in base rates 
the current base rate for fuel and purchased power costs is based on price levels and spot prices for natural gas and wholesale power have increased over since then 
although aps defers actual fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis  aps recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual psa adjustments and acc approval of periodic surcharge applications 
actual fuel and purchased power costs are higher than in prior periods primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased plant outage days 
aps pretax psa deferrals were approximately million at december  based on recent forward market prices for natural gas and purchased power which are subject to change  and assuming no interim rate relief  aps estimates that its pretax psa deferrals in will be approximately million to million 
in january  the acc approved the first annual adjustment under the psa mechanism  which is expected to recover approximately million of the balance of million from retail customers over twelve months beginning february  in this same order  the acc granted aps the authority to continue to defer fuel costs in excess of the million annual fuel cost cap established in the rate order and to seek recovery of those amounts in a future proceeding 
on february   aps filed a request with the acc to recover the remainder of the retail portion of the deferred fuel balance of million approximately million through two surcharges 
the first surcharge is to recover million over a twelve month period proposed to begin with the date of the acc s decision in aps pending emergency interim rate case 
the second surcharge is to recover approximately million over a twelve month period proposed to begin no later than the acc s completion of its inquiry regarding unplanned outages at palo verde 
the million of psa deferrals represents additional replacement power costs associated with these outages

table of contents customer growth  lower depreciation due to lower depreciation rates  lower regulatory asset amortization  and effects of weather on retail sales 
these positive factors were partially offset by the regulatory disallowance of plant costs in accordance with the aps retail rate case settlement  higher fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to higher prices and more plant outage days  higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service  and higher property taxes due to increased plant in service 
real estate segment income from continuing operations decreased approximately million primarily due to decreased parcel sales  partially offset by increased margins on home sales 
income from discontinued real estate operations increased million due to higher commercial property sales

critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 
regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa 
aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates 
we had million  including million related to the psa  of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  included in the million is approximately million related to the unplanned palo verde outages  which currently are the subject of inquiry by the acc 
in addition  we had million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december  
table of contents  which primarily are related to removal costs 
see notes and for more information about regulatory assets  aps general rate case and power supply adjustor 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december  projected benefit obligation  our december  reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on pinnacle west s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions increase decrease impact on projected impact on impact on benefit pension pension actuarial assumption a obligation liability expense discount rate increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december  accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and our reported other postretirement benefit expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on pinnacle west s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

b this assumes a change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate 
see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met 
for fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable 
in some cases  we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value 
the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods 
our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis

these revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix  customer growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity rates and tariffs and variations in weather from period to period 
competitive sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by aps energy services in certain western states that have opened to competition 
retail rate proceedings the key issue affecting pinnacle west s and aps financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps retail rate proceedings pending before the acc 
as discussed in greater detail in note  aps has pending before the acc a general retail rate case  an application for an emergency interim rate increase  and an application for two separate surcharges under the psa 
fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service  variances in deferrals and amortization of fuel and purchased power beginning on april  and our hedging program for managing such costs 
see power supply adjustor in note for information regarding the psa approved by the acc

see overview in this item for information about palo verde unit operating at reduced power levels and the related economic impact 
customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to native load customers and sales to them 
customer growth in aps service territory averaged about a year for the three years through  we currently expect customer growth to average about per year from to we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow on average  from through  before the effects of weather variations 
customer growth for was 
actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
weather in forecasting retail sales growth  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
wholesale power market conditions the marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing aps risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand 
the marketing and trading division  subject to specified parameters  markets  hedges and trades in electricity  fuels and emission allowances and

our future earnings will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market 
other factors affecting financial results operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant additions and operations  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property  which include generation construction or acquisition  changes in depreciation and amortization rates see note  and changes in regulatory asset amortization 
see note for information on aps acquisition of the sundance plant in see purchased power in part i  item of this report  for more information on requests for proposal to acquire additional long term resources in and property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by tax rates and the value of property in service and under construction 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of assessed value for and we expect property taxes to increase as new power plants  the acquisition of the sundance plant and our additions to transmission and distribution facilities are included in the property tax base 
interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt 
the primary factors affecting borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital requirements and our internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
interest expense is also affected by interest rates on variable rate debt 
retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in and  there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps customers 
as a result  we cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional competitors will re enter aps service territory

general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors 
see forward looking statements for further information on such factors  which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 
market risks our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 

table of contents interest rate and equity risk our major financial market risk exposure is to changing interest rates 
changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable rate debt and interest earned by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
the nuclear decommissioning fund also has risk associated with the changing market value of equity investments 
nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
our ermc  consisting of officers and key management personnel  oversees company wide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies 
as part of our risk management program  we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity  fuels and emissions allowances and credits 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 
in addition  subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ermc  we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements 

table of contents the mark to market value of derivative instruments related to our risk management and trading activities are presented in two categories consistent with our business segments regulated electricity non trading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases and sales of electricity and fuel for aps native load requirements of our regulated electricity business segment  and marketing and trading non trading and trading derivative instruments of our competitive business segment

arizona public service company results of operations general throughout the following explanations of our results of operations  we refer to gross margin 
gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs 
gross margin is a non gaap financial measure  as defined in accordance with sec rules 
exhibit reconciles this non gaap financial measure to operating income  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses 
in addition  we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation 

table of contents deferred fuel and purchased power costs the settlement of aps general retail rate case became effective april  as part of the settlement  the acc approved a annual retail rate increase and the psa  which provides mechanisms for adjusting rates to reflect variations in fuel and purchased power costs 
in accordance with the psa  aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system sales margins  and the amount for such costs currently included in base rates 
the current base rate for fuel and purchased power costs is based on price levels and spot prices for natural gas and wholesale power have increased over since then 
although aps defers actual fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis  aps recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual psa adjustments and acc approval of periodic surcharge applications 
actual fuel and purchased power costs are higher than in prior periods primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased plant outage days 
aps pretax psa deferrals were approximately million at december  based on recent forward market prices for natural gas and purchased power which are subject to change  and assuming no interim rate relief  aps estimates that its pretax psa deferrals in will be approximately million to million 
in january  the acc approved the first annual adjustment under the psa mechanism  which is expected to recover approximately million of the balance of million from retail customers over twelve months beginning february  in this same order  the acc granted aps the authority to continue to defer fuel costs in excess of the million annual fuel cost cap established in the rate order and to seek recovery of those amounts in a future proceeding 
on february   aps filed a request with the acc to recover the remainder of the retail portion of the deferred fuel balance of million approximately million through two surcharges 
the first surcharge is to recover million over a twelve month period proposed to begin with the date of the acc s decision in aps pending emergency interim rate case 
the second surcharge is to recover approximately million over a twelve month period proposed to begin no later than the acc s completion of its inquiry regarding unplanned outages at palo verde 
the million of psa deferrals represents additional replacement power costs associated with these outages 
see note see overview in this item for information about palo verde unit operating at reduced power levels and the related economic impact 
compared with aps net income for was million compared with million for the prior year 
the million decrease was primarily due to the regulatory disallowance of plant costs in accordance with the aps retail rate case settlement  higher fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to higher prices and more plant outage days  higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service costs  and higher property taxes due to increased plant in service 
these negative factors were partially offset by deferred fuel and purchased power costs  a retail price increase effective april   higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth  lower depreciation due to lower depreciation rates  lower regulatory asset amortization  and effects of weather on retail sales 
additional details on the major factors that increased decreased net income are contained in the following table dollars in millions

table of contents marketing and trading revenues marketing and trading revenues were million lower for compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of a million decrease in energy trading revenues on realized sales of electricity primarily due to lower delivered electricity prices and lower volumes  a million decrease in off system sales due to the absence of sales previously reported in marketing and trading that were classified beginning in april as sales in regulated electricity in accordance with the aps retail rate case settlement  and an million decrease on future mark to market gains due to higher prices 
compared with aps net income for was million compared with million for the prior year 
the million increase in the period to period comparison reflects lower regulatory asset amortization  the benefit of customer growth  decreased purchased power and fuel costs primarily due to lower prices for capacity purchases  increased interest income and lower replacement power costs due to fewer unplanned outages 
these positive factors were partially offset by increased operations and maintenance costs related to increased generation  customer service and personnel costs  the effects of weather on retail sales  higher depreciation and amortization related to increased delivery and other assets  lower realized margins on energy trading due to higher wholesale electricity prices  a retail electricity price reduction  lower income tax credits  and higher interest expense primarily due to increased utility plant in service
