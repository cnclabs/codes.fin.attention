item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
overview stillwater mining company mines  processes  refines and markets palladium  platinum and minor amounts of other metals from the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
the company operates two mines stillwater and east boulder within the j m reef  each with substantial underground operations and a surface mill and concentrator 
concentrates produced at the two mines are shipped to the company s smelter and base metals refinery at columbus  montana  where they are further processed into a pgm filter cake that is sent to third party refiners for final processing 
substantially all of the platinum and palladium produced from mining is sold under contracts with three major automotive manufacturers  general motors corporation  ford motor company  and mitsubishi corporation  for use in automotive catalytic converters 
these contracts include floor and  in some cases  ceiling prices on palladium and platinum that have benefited the company significantly in periods of low palladium prices 
performance the company had a net loss of million in  compared to net income of million in a detailed comparison of these outcomes is presented below in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company produced a total of  ounces of platinum and palladium  including  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
this pgm production level was within the range of the company s public guidance  provided in early  of between  and  ounces 
capital spending in was increased substantially to extend the developed state of both mines  including proven ore reserves and infrastructure to facilitate a move to higher rates of production in the future 
with this significant allocation of resources to development and away from production  pgm production decreased below the level of output in the company is targeting total mine pgm production of between  and  ounces for  reflecting the increased mine development and the early benefits of implementing more selective mining methods at both mines  although the company s ability to meet these targets is subject to certain risks 
see risk factors achievement of the company s production goals is subject to uncertainties above 
the company also recovers and processes spent pgm material from recycled catalytic converters in its smelting and refining facilities  thereby utilizing capacity for such activity in those facilities 
while the company has processed minor amounts of these materials since  in late the company entered into an agreement with a major us collector of such material to purchase substantial volumes for processing 
this agreement was modified and extended during to facilitate expansion of these activities 
the commercial terms of this agreement are confidential  but either party is able to terminate the relationship at its discretion upon providing ninety days notice 
the company also has spot purchase and tolling arrangements with other suppliers of spent catalytic materials 
contained pgms in this recycling activity exceeded  ounces in  up from at year end the company was processing catalytic materials  both for its own account and on a tolling basis  at a rate of about ten tons per day 
in june  the company received  ounces of palladium from norilsk nickel as part of the consideration in the acquisition of an approximately ownership interest in the company 
the company entered into contracts in early with three customers to sell this palladium ratably over a two year period at a slight discount to market prices  thereby assuring transparency of these sales within the palladium market 
through december   the company had sold  ounces of this palladium inventory 
the balance of the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction will be sold during the first quarter of as disclosed in january  in reviewing and testing the company s internal controls over financial reporting at year end  the company s internal auditors identified several control deficiencies in the company s accounting for miscellaneous metal sales resulting from new business arrangements that in the judgment of management collectively aggregated to the level of a material weakness 
these control issues did not involve any of the company s major commercial sales agreements 
the company disclosed  in conjunction with these control deficiencies and a repricing of its credit facility to lower interest cost  that up to million associated with miscellaneous metal sales could be in doubt 
after examination  the company wrote down consigned inventory by million at december  the company has taken steps to strengthen its internal controls in this area  including augmenting staff  strengthening period end review and reconciliations  and revising process documentation to clarify the roles and responsibilities of those involved in accounting for miscellaneous metal sales 
the effectiveness of these revised controls will be tested as part of the company s internal audit procedures at the end of the first quarter 
table of contents strategic initiatives the company s management is addressing a number of structural issues first  despite above market floor prices in the company s contracts with the auto companies and despite the company s costs per ounce of pgm production being competitive with other primary pgm producers in the industry  the company s high grade reserve is palladium rich  with a ratio of ounces of palladium to one ounce platinum  as compared with the platinum rich ratio of its south african peers 
consequently  the company s operations  as currently configured  are only marginally competitive with other pgm companies when palladium prices are low 
second  although the company s cash generation has been strong particularly with the benefit of sales of the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction capital spending to extend the developed state of both mines has been increased  and will remain high through and decline thereafter 
the company s cash balance grew in  but could decline in as sales of the palladium from the norilsk nickel transaction come to an end during the first quarter of third  the company s business profile as essentially a one product  one operation company is not sufficiently diversified in light of the historical volatility of the pgm markets 
in addition  the company may be exposed to lower realized prices once the current auto contracts expire at the end of while the company continues to view itself as a primary pgm producer  attractive opportunities to further diversify within pgms are scarce 
in response to these issues  the company is implementing a number of key strategic initiatives marketing palladium  transforming the mines and diversifying operations 
while each initiative is moving forward  some will be implemented sequentially and their full implementation will take several years 
those involving external markets are beyond management s direct control  and consequently for them  a projection of specific results and timing is not possible 
marketing palladium significant market support for platinum has existed for many years  while corresponding support for palladium has been limited 
as a result  efforts to develop new or expanded applications for palladium have been unpredictable 
palladium has emerged in the last couple of years as a primary jewelry metal based primarily on its price relative to gold and platinum 
the company has closely followed this development and championed and chronicled it for the industry 
more over  the company has undertaken a limited effort to promote or bring some structure to market development for palladium including the following areas palladium used for jewelry 
last year  the company reported on the tremendous growth of palladium jewelry as a substitute for white gold in the chinese jewelry markets 
this growth has been remarkable  increasing from almost nothing in to over million ounces in in support of this developing market  the company has sponsored several jewelry industry technical articles for the us market on working with palladium in making jewelry and has translated these into chinese for distribution into the chinese market 
the company also has worked with various jewelry manufacturers outside of china  assisting in their development of palladium jewelry lines for us and european markets 
palladium wedding jewelry  including a bridal line  is now widely available in the us palladium chains are now being produced in italy for distribution worldwide 
palladium s lower price and lower comparative weight  combined with its high purity and attractive bright white appearance  appear to be driving this emerging popularity as the cinderella precious metal in jewelry applications 
cinderella  in that it has always been an attractive white  bright and light metal ideal for jewelry  only recently being recognized as such 
stillwater recently formed the world palladium institute wpi  a legal entity based in the united kingdom 
the purpose of the wpi is to promote the use of palladium in the jewelry market 
the company has discussed the concept of the wpi with industry participants and invited their participation 
most are sympathetic to the concerns we express and it has been suggested by some that such an organization become part of the platinum guild international  which has been extremely successful in its platinum marketing efforts over the years 
we considered these responses and concluded that waiting for a consensus on these matters is not prudent given existing market dynamics 
thus  the concept of the wpi was introduced at the ja jewelry show in new york city in early where it was well received 
plans are underway to introduce the wpi in shanghai in march  followed by a formal launch at the jck show in las vegas in june 
these efforts are now coming to fruition  with significant interest from the jewelry industry 
palladium used for hydrogen energy 
the company has also turned its attention to potential applications for palladium in fuel cells and a future hydrogen economy 
significant research programs already exist with government and private funding in these areas  so the company does not see any need for a role in funding direct palladium research at this time 
however  the company has encouraged the allocation of government research funds to this area  and has tracked published papers regarding research findings on topics of potential interest 
the company also has informally encouraged consideration of palladium as an alternative in applications that would appear to hold promise  particularly with regard to fuel cell technology 
for instance  included in the energy bill passed by congress is an appropriation for a montana hydrogen palladium research center 

table of contents palladium used for diesel engines 
two years ago  in response to the development of catalytic converters for diesel engines using only platinum  the company recognized that the higher temperature stability of palladium could make it a useful adjunct to the use of platinum in reducing diesel particulate matter ie  soot emitted by diesel engines 
since then  this technology has been developed and implemented 
with the migration from clean gasoline engines using palladium rich catalytic converters to clean diesel engines which now enjoy almost a market share of new cars produced in europe and have potential for much broader use in other regions of the world this has contributed significantly to the demand for palladium in europe 
transforming mining operations stillwater mining company has identified a series of operating changes designed to increase efficiency  reduce unit costs of production  and increase total pgm ounces produced  in essence a total reworking of mine operations  all in an effort to address the company s economic viability after when the company no longer has the benefit of the pgm pricing floors included in the current contracts with the auto companies 
since  the company has implemented a multi faceted program of continual improvement in safety for employees throughout the company 
the company s get guide  educate and train safe safety and health management systems focus on accident prevention  seeking opportunities for safer mining methods and increased employee awareness and training 
specific areas of emphasis include enhanced work place examinations  joint union management safety committees  critical task analysis  loss control representatives drawn from the mining workforce  implementation of measurable safety standards and intra operational safety audits 
employee led focus teams have been successful in solving many safety related challenges 
during  continued focus on improving company safety performance resulted in an incidence rate reduction of from  bringing us to a total reduction since the inception of the get safe in in  the stillwater mine received an award from the assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health  recognizing stillwater as the most improved mine in the rocky mountain district 
in  the montana department of labor and osha jointly recognized the company s metallurgical complex in columbus  montana as a leader in workplace safety 
the smelter was the recipient of its eleventh safety and health achievement recognition program sharp award and the refinery received its seventh 
the company s laboratory also received the sharp award in the sharp program recognizes employers who have demonstrated exemplary achievements in workplace safety and health 
in  attention to further employee participation and involvement will be enhanced through the involvement of loss control representatives drawn from the hourly workforce and the expanded implementation of internal safety auditing processes 
in the company began to increase the developed state of both mines thereby increasing proven ore reserves to facilitate advanced planning and mining efficiency and to add the necessary infrastructure support 
the developed state at both mines was intentionally decreased during the company s financial challenges beginning in late in the fall of  as palladium prices dropped sharply  the company curtailed development expenditures at the stillwater mine and brought the east boulder mine on line short of completion in order to conserve available cash 
at the same time  there was an effort to increase production in order to generate additional cash flow  resulting in a steady contraction of proven ore reserves at both mines 
during  the company accelerated capital spending  not just to arrest this contraction in proven ore reserves  but also to expand proven ore reserves in support of higher production rates in the future 
capital spending was increased from million in  to million in  and to million in capital spending for is expected to continue at or slightly above the level  and will be reduced in and thereafter to a level required to maintain this backlog of proven ore reserves 
annual spending for primary development will be targeted to achieve and then maintain proven ore reserves equal to about months production at each mine s full production potential about million tons for the stillwater mine and million tons for the east boulder mine 
results of the capital program included a increase in total proven ore reserves to million tons  even after taking into account production 
the first of two new ventilation raises at the east boulder mine was completed in late and the second is now on target for completion in ground control and manpower issues delayed completion of the first raise 
excavation for a new sand plant in the upper west area of the stillwater mine is underway and primary development in company wide exceeded  feet of new footwall lateral and associated primary ramps  and  feet of diamond drilling 
while the majority of the funding need for these programs will come from operations  at december   the company has significant cash and other liquidity available to support these initiatives 
cash and cash equivalents  plus highly liquid investment holdings  total million at december   and unutilized revolving credit lines add another million of potential liquidity 
once the sales of palladium ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction are completed in february  the company expects it will draw against some of its cash holdings during in support of this development effort 

table of contents the company is in the process of changing its mining methods from mechanical to selective 
the change to selective mining began in test mining continues in and the larger change will be implemented over a period of years 
selective mining will increase recovery of the reserve  decrease secondary development and associated costs  decrease dilution resulting in a higher grade ore delivered to the mill and decrease reliance on mobile mining equipment thereby reducing capital and support costs 
the change involves greater use of conventional captive cut and fill mining  a method that inherently allows greater access to mine reserves  generates less waste rock and can follow the ore trend more closely along the j m reef 
the decision to make greater use of mechanical mining methods in the past was driven by a decision made to increase production rates when the palladium price was high and by the limited availability of skilled manpower that captive cut and fill mining requires 
a careful analysis of the company s various mining methods suggested that the penalty being paid in mining width  equipment capital and maintenance costs  and additional mine development in order to utilize more mechanized mining methods  in many cases appears to diminish the economic performance 
in conjunction with the move toward more selective extraction methods  the company also is utilizing alimaks to access certain stopes more efficiently 
alimaks are cogged rail platforms  similar to an elevator that can be installed in a raise bore or conventional raise 
the alimaks not only facilitate access to the stopes  but also may expedite raise ups the process of preparing the initial work area on each successive level in the stope 
raise ups are normally the most inefficient and time consuming elements of conventional cut and fill mining  and the use of alimaks should improve this process substantially 
these adjustments to the company s mining methods will initially result in a modest reduction in total ore tons produced and an expected increase in realized grade that more than offsets the tonnage reduction 
with less equipment and development required  over time capital expenditure requirements will be reduced  along with maintenance and support costs 
ultimately the net result should be a significant increase in ounces produced and a reduction in costs per ounce  as is mentioned in the fourth initiative 
in april  the company s board established a special committee on ore reserves concurrently with the approval for the development work required to expand the proven ore reserves 
the committee met three times during with management and outside experts to review ore reserve methodology  review best practice in the industry and receive reports on the progress and results of the company s proven ore reserve expansion program 
the committee expects to continue its work through as appropriate 
the company plans over time to increase mine production to design capacity thereby increasing total pgm production and reducing unit cash costs 
design capacity at the stillwater mine is approximately  ore tons per day  and at the east boulder mine   ore tons per day  which would represent an increase of over current production levels 
ore production at the stillwater mine was down between and  as some of the production resources at the mine in were diverted into the effort to improve the developed state 
average daily production in was  tons  compared to  tons per day in however  included the effect of lost production during the ten day strike in july 
the company also intends to gradually increase production at the stillwater mine toward full capacity 
the concentrator at the stillwater mine is designed for  tons per day  but after allowing for reprocessing of slag from the smelter  net capacity is approximately  tons per day 
the company had announced previously a program to expand the infrastructure at the east boulder mine in order to be able to increase ore production there to  tons per day 
this effort will include additional primary development to increase the number of ramp systems and working faces  diamond drilling associated with the expanded development  and addition of two new ventilation raises to surface to improve underground air quality 
addition of this infrastructure is ongoing  although the objective of reaching  tons per day of production has been deferred until the company can assess opportunities to improve realized grade at the mine through more selective mining methods 
nevertheless  ore production at the east boulder mine during the fourth quarter of reached an average of  tons per day  up from  tons per day during and  tons per day averaged for the full year full permitted capacity at the east boulder concentrator is approximately  tons per day 
increasing the percentage of mining from captive cut and fill stopes is more manpower intensive than mechanized methods  and there is a growing shortage of skilled miners available in the industry to do this work 
the company recognizes this as both a company and a general industry concern  and as a result recently has initiated a comprehensive program to train a new generation of underground miners for the future 
this effort will require dedicating substantial resources to recruiting and training over a period of several years 
these mining positions are high paying and offer an attractive work schedule  and to date  the company has had no difficulty attracting interested candidates 
this program provides a unique opportunity for the company to bring in talent from local montana communities and to train them from the beginning according to state of the art mining and safety practices 

table of contents in the process of these initiatives the company has the opportunity to reduce operating spending through additional operating efficiencies  economies of scale  emerging technologies and reconfiguring its organization 
the ore reserve determination for was tested on a combined metal price per ounce of the twelve quarter rolling average and assumes the economics to be realized from the above changes in mining 
at year end the combined per ounce metal price was following a regular review of its filings by the sec  and on its own initiative  in april  the company s board established a special committee on ore reserves concurrently with the approval for the development work required to expand the proven ore reserves 
the committee met three times during with management and outside experts to review ore reserve methodology  identify best practices in the industry and receive reports on the progress and results of the company s proven ore reserve expansion program 
the committee expects to continue its work through as appropriate 
diversification while stillwater is a pgm company  it has not limited its consideration of future growth opportunities to pgms  given their scarcity 
the company produces gold  silver  nickel and copper as by products from its existing operations  each of which would be geologically and operationally compatible with its existing capabilities 
on the other hand  the company recognizes some shareholders may prefer to view stillwater as a pgm investment  and so might consider other metals incompatible from an investment standpoint 
if one recognizes that mines  by their very nature  have a finite life  either through exhaustion of their minerals or exhaustion of their economics  it becomes clear why mining companies seek to reduce single mine risk by developing a portfolio of mines 
the company is unable to focus its growth effort on accumulating a portfolio of pgm mines  due to the scarcity of economically attractive pgm projects 
thus  the company concludes other metals must be considered if it is to reduce its risk profile from essentially a one product  one resource company 
management believes this expanded search may also put the company in a better position to enlarge its pgm portfolio 
the company will report further on this initiative as appropriate 
key issues facing the company management has identified a number of key issues that need to be addressed in conjunction with the company s ongoing strategic efforts 
these are outlined briefly below 
the cash flow from sale of the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction will come to an end during the first quarter of these ounces have been carried as inventory on the company s financial statements at a cost of per ounce 
with the relatively low palladium prices in late and most of  the profit margin on these sales at times has been small  although the total cash generation from the sales has been significant typically  between and million per month 
the remaining ounces are scheduled to be sold by the end of february  at which time their substantial cash flow benefit will come to an end 
the company s long term sales agreements with general motors  ford and mitsubishi  which include floor prices that have protected the company in times of low pgm prices  will all expire on or before december  while two of these contracts will expire before  the terms of the third contract provide for it to absorb most of the production previously sold under the expiring agreements 
these contracts currently cover all of the company s mined production of palladium and about of the company s mined output of platinum 
once these contracts are gone  unless the company enters into similar arrangements thereafter  the company essentially will be exposed to the full volatility of pgm prices 
at the price levels prevailing during most of  the company s cash flow would have been negative without the floor prices in these contracts 
during the third and fourth quarters of and first quarter of  the major us bond rating agencies downgraded the corporate ratings of general motors corporation and ford motor company 
under applicable law  in the event one or both of these companies becomes insolvent or files for protection under the bankruptcy statutes  their respective obligations under these pgm supply agreements could be voided 
in addition  under the terms of the company s credit facility  a default by ford or general motors or the early termination of these contracts could prohibit additional loans and trigger a requirement for the immediate repayment of the company s outstanding loans 
the company s mechanized mining methods  taken together with the associated maintenance and support functions  are high cost  largely as a result of the complexity of the orebody the company mines 
significant quantities of waste material are moved as part of the typical mining process 
in addition  the company incurs high capital costs for ongoing development that is necessary to sustain continuing operations 
these capital costs were unusually high in  as is discussed below 
when operating and capital costs are combined  mining operations in did not produce positive cash flow 

table of contents several other major pgm producers in the mining industry either produce pgms as a by product of other refining or enjoy ores with a substantially higher proportion of the historically higher priced platinum over palladium 
the company does not enjoy these advantages  putting it at a disadvantage when prices are low 
the company s unit costs generally are affected by the level of ore production  by the consistency and quality of the ore mined  by the mining method utilized  and by overall operating efficiency 
despite very substantial progress over the past four years  safety issues remain of paramount importance 
rigorous application of task analysis  employee education and incident follow up have reduced the company s incident rates to well below the national average for underground mines 
however  despite these encouraging statistics  the company experienced a fatality underground during the company continues to coordinate closely with msha and industry safety groups to ensure best practices are in place and being followed 
with the general strengthening of mineral prices over the past two years  the demand for experienced miners has grown significantly 
there is now a shortage of skilled miners within the united states and canada  and as new operations are developed  the shortage has grown 
coming off the past decade or so of depressed commodity prices  very few new miners and mining engineers were being trained  so the industry is now faced with a fixed or declining pool of skilled workers in an expanding market 
the company s operations are relatively manpower intensive  so a shortage of skilled labor could restrict the company s ability to maintain or expand production levels 
the company s hourly workforce is represented by the united steelworkers of america under two separate labor agreements 
the agreement covering the workers at the stillwater mine and at the company s processing facilities in columbus  montana was renewed in july following a ten day work stoppage and will expire on june  as reported previously  the labor agreement covering the hourly workforce at the east boulder mine was renewed during and will expire on june  the company cannot assure that it will not experience labor interruptions or other disagreements with labor unions or employees in the future 
with the steep decline in palladium price between and early  the company cut back on mine development expenditures in order to conserve cash 
as a result  the company s proven ore reserves had steadily declined  to the extent that by some production was of necessity coming out of probable reserves that typically had been drilled but not fully evaluated prior to the start of production 
the time and capital cost of restoring the company s proven ore reserves is significant and now being undertaken and is critical to efficient mining 
the volatility of pgm prices  driven in part by occasional supply surpluses that emerge particularly in palladium  is of significant long term concern at the company s current production cost levels 
obviously  the company has no direct control over pgm prices  although there are steps it can take hedging  long term sales agreements  etc 
to reduce exposure to price volatility 
producer economics  along with recycling opportunities  suggest that the supply of pgms is likely to grow gradually over time  probably more from the expansion of existing operations than from new ventures  which at least at this point all appear to be fairly low grade 
that leaves some opportunity on the demand side for fostering new or expanded uses for pgms  and particularly for palladium 
as of december   the company had secured platinum prices in the forward market by entering into financially settled forward transactions covering over half of the company s anticipated platinum mine production for the period from january through june in view of the exceptionally wide price disparity between platinum and palladium that exists at december   the company notes that the price of platinum could weaken if consumers begin substituting significant quantities of palladium and other metals for platinum in major applications 
in order to protect against this downside  as of december   the company had open financially settled forward contracts covering a total of  ounces of platinum at an overall average price of about per ounce 
the hedges are expected to modestly reduce the overall volatility of the company s earnings and cash flow 
under these hedging arrangements  in return for protection against downward movements in the platinum price  the company gives up the benefit of increases in the platinum price on the hedged ounces 
the company recorded costs in totaling million for fixed forward and financially settled forward contracts that settled below market price during corresponding costs recorded in and totaled million in each year 
capitalized mine development mine development expenditures incurred to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized and amortized using a units of production method 
mine development expenditures include shafts  surface adits and underground infrastructure development  including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
these facilities are required not only for current operations  but also as continuing infrastructure in support of future planned operations 

table of contents the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production in each applicable area of the mine 
the amortization rate is based upon unamortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital expenditures are added to the unamortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
probable ore reserves normally cannot be extracted without additional capital expenditures required to access and delineate them 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company changed its accounting method for amortizing capitalized mine development costs effective january  these mine development costs include the initial costs incurred to gain primary access to the ore reserves  plus the ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps driven parallel to the reef that are used to access and provide support for the mining stopes in the reef 
prior to  the company amortized all such capitalized development costs at its mines over all proven and probable reserves at each mine 
following the asset impairment write down at the end of  the company revisited its assumptions and estimates for amortizing capitalized mine development costs 
as a result  the company changed its method of accounting for the amortization of development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  are to be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
this change in accounting method required the company to measure the cumulative effect of the change at january   as if the new method of amortization had been used in all prior years 
the credit for the cumulative effect of the change for all years prior to of million  is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the company also amended its previously filed form q s for the first three quarters of to reflect this change in accounting method 
the company s financial statements also include the pro forma effect of the accounting change on its financial results 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and to access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
during and  depreciation and amortization rates were affected by the impairment charge in that reduced the carrying value of the east boulder mine  the stillwater mine and the processing and other facilities  which in turn reduced their depreciation and amortization bases  by the change in the accounting method used to amortize capitalized mine development costs  and by additional development costs placed in service during those years 
due to the change in accounting method  certain capitalized mine development costs are being amortized over a shorter period than before  which has resulted in higher amortization expense in each period than the company had experienced in the past 
revenues under the terms of sales contracts and purchase orders received from customers  the company recognizes revenue when the product is in a refined and saleable form and title passes  which is typically when the product is transferred from the account of the company to the account of the customer 
the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide market prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has little or no control 
sales to significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  the company could  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal on a spot basis and at spot prices in any of various commodity markets throughout the world 

table of contents from time to time  the company has used basic hedging techniques involving fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards 
the objective of such metals hedging transactions has been to secure firm prices for the company s pgm production  to benefit from price increases or to protect against price decreases on that portion of production that falls outside the range of the floor or ceiling prices embedded in the long term auto company contracts 
such hedging contracts also may preclude the company from obtaining the full benefit of increased market prices for its contracted metals 
in  the company reported a charge against income of million representing the difference between financially settled forward prices and actual market prices at the date of settlement all related to mine production 
in the corresponding effect on income was million a million charge against mine production and a million credit to recycling activities 
the company had no metals hedging activity during see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company currently uses forward contracts and financially settled forwards to manage the potential negative effects of metal price volatility on its financial results 
during  the company entered into various fixed forwards and financially settled forward contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place covering  ounces of metal sales through june see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company has credit agreements with its major trading partners that provide for margin deposits in the event that forward prices for metals exceed the company s hedge contract prices by a predetermined margin limit 
as of december   no such margin deposits were outstanding or due 
the company s revenues and ounces sold were as follows for the years ended december ounces of ounces of ounces of in thousands of palladium of platinum of other palladium platinum other mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction and other total mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction and other total mine production pgm recycling other total 
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
most of the increase was attributable to higher market prices for platinum and rhodium  including metal purchased for resale 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in revenues from pgm recycling were million in  compared to million in this increase in revenues from pgm recycling was due both to an increase to  ounces in the quantity of recycled pgms sold in  compared to  ounces in  and to substantially higher market prices for platinum and rhodium in in addition to the sales of recycled pgm ounces  the company also processes higher volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis  smelting and refining materials owned by others for a fee 
during  the company toll processed approximately  tolled ounces of pgms  up from approximately  tolled ounces in revenues from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other miscellaneous revenues totaled million in  compared to million in within these totals  sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction alone generated million in revenues during on sales of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average realization of per ounce 
comparable palladium sales for generated million in revenue on  ounces  for an average realization of per ounce  reflecting somewhat higher average market prices for palladium during the company has approximately  ounces of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction remaining in inventory at december   all scheduled to be sold during january and february of one of the sales contracts providing for the sale and delivery of the palladium ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction also requires the company to provide  ounces platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month  either purchased on the open market or produced from the company s mining operations 
the company recognized revenue of million and million under these sales contracts in and  respectively 
cost of metals sold 
cost of metals sold was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
approximately million of the million increase is related to sales of the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and purchases of platinum and rhodium for resale 
another million relates to increased volumes and higher acquisition cost for recycled pgm materials 
the remainder is largely attributable to higher labor and materials costs at the company s operating mines and to the million cost of a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment to reflect a market value of metals lower than cost in inventory at december  the cost of metals sold from mine production was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the cost increase is driven slightly by the increase in ounces sold during and by the write off of million in consigned inventory 
more significant  however  are increased costs for labor and key raw materials particularly steel and fuel that have increased substantially since labor costs increased year on year by  while total materials and supplies  including maintenance supplies  increased 
the cost of metals sold from pgm recycling activities was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the higher cost of acquiring catalytic materials for recycling as the underlying prices for platinum and rhodium contained in those materials increased during actual ounces of material from recycling increased by only  but average platinum prices increased by and average rhodium prices rose nearly year on year 
the cost of metals sold from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities was million in  compared to million in this increase was driven both by higher metal volumes and by significantly higher platinum and rhodium prices  offset in part by somewhat lower palladium prices 
the total cost of palladium sold from just those ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million in  representing the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average cost of just over per ounce 
the comparable cost for the  ounces sold during was approximately million 
the remainder of these sales in both years represents mostly the cost of sourcing platinum and rhodium to meet contractual commitments 
as discussed in revenues above  the company entered into sales contracts in which required it to source metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments to customers 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million and million in and respectively 
most of the year on year difference here is attributable to higher volumes and costs for rhodium purchases

the cost of metals sold from mine production was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in ounces sold offset in part by an increase in the company s cost of metals sold per ounce 
the increase in the company s cost of metals sold per ounce was primarily due to higher direct mining costs as result of production losses from the labor stoppage at the stillwater mine and processing facilities during the third quarter of and higher royalty costs as a result of higher realized pgm prices in compared to those in these higher costs were offset by higher by product credits in the cost of metals sold from recycling activities was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the cost of acquiring and processing the increased ounces generated from the company s long term sourcing agreement for spent catalytic materials entered into during the fourth quarter of the cost of metals sold from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities was million in  compared to million in the total cost of palladium sold from just those ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million in  representing the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average cost of per ounce

the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase is primarily due to the change in accounting method for the amortization of capitalized mine development costs see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the change  unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine will continue to be treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all past and ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  will be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development

for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to and million for and the changes were primarily a result of year ended december  in thousands cash collected from customers cash paid to suppliers  employees  etc 
interest received interest paid net cash provided by operating activities the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
at the pgm price levels prevailing at december   absent separate hedging arrangements  a change in the price of platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to price ceilings on a small portion of the company s long term sales contracts  and certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
however  as of december   the company has hedged a significant portion of its sales of mined platinum through june of in general  as of december   these hedges were fixed at platinum prices at or below current market prices  and therefore the company s participation in increases in the price of platinum would be limited to the unhedged portion of production 
under the company s long term sales contracts for mined production  a change in the market price of palladium  at prices prevailing on december   would not flow through to cash flow from operations  except to the extent that the market price for palladium exceeded any of the price floors in those contracts 
sales out of the palladium inventory received in conjunction with the norilsk nickel transaction are not subject to price floors  and therefore price changes related to sales of that inventory would directly affect cash flow from operations 
the company hedges the selling price of pgms in its recycling activities  so a change in the market price of platinum and palladium on sales of recycling materials would have little or no effect on margins earned from this activity and on cash flow from operations 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  the company s forecasts indicate that such a reduction in mine production would not impair the company s ability to repay its outstanding debt or to maintain its planned level of capital expenditures  although a significantly larger reduction in mine production could adversely affect the company s financial position

critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground orebody and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the orebody  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of a vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 

table of contents the company changed its accounting method for amortizing capitalized mine development costs effective january  these mine development costs include the initial costs incurred to gain primary access to the ore reserves  plus the ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps driven parallel to the reef that are used to access and provide support for the mining stopes in the reef 
prior to  the company amortized all such capitalized development costs at its mines over all proven and probable reserves at each mine 
following the asset impairment write down at the end of  the company revisited its assumptions and estimates for amortizing capitalized mine development costs 
following this review  the company determined to change its method of accounting for development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine will continue to be treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  will be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
this change in accounting method required the company to measure the effect of the change at january   as if the new method of amortization had been used in all prior years 
the credit for the cumulative effect of the change for all years prior to of million  is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the company also amended its previously filed form qs for the first three quarters of to reflect the accounting change 
the company s financial statements also include the pro forma effect of the accounting change on its and financial results 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in grade or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 
asset impairment the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contract prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
the company recognized an impairment of its principal mining assets at december   and recorded a corresponding valuation adjustment of million  reducing the carrying value of the properties to their fair market value  as required by sfas no 
the impairment charge consisted of a million reduction in asset value at the stillwater mine  a million reduction at the east boulder mine  and a million reduction at the company s processing and other facilities 
as a result  at december   the carrying value of the stillwater mine was reduced to million  east boulder mine to million  and the processing and other facilities to million 
the independent appraiser  behre dolbear and company  utilized conventional mine valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis  for purposes of determining the fair market values 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
 the company has determined that the carrying value of the company s assets was not impaired at december  or december  
table of contents income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december   and december   for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
based on the company s current financial projections  and in view of the level of tax depreciation and depletion deductions available  it appears unlikely that the company will owe any income taxes for the foreseeable future 
however  if average realized pgm prices were to increase substantially in the future  the company could owe income taxes prospectively on the resulting higher taxable income 
post closure reclamation costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by the company 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its sfas no 
assumptions at december  and determined no increase to its asset retirement obligation and liability was necessary 
derivative instruments from time to time  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and manage interest rate risk 
as of december   the outstanding derivatives associated with commodity instruments are valued at an unrealized cost of million  and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   there were no outstanding interest rate swaps see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and from time to time uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be offset by changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company and mitsubishi corporation 
the contracts together cover significant portions of the company s mined pgm production through december and stipulate floor and ceiling prices for some of the covered production 
in the first quarter of the company also entered into three new sales contracts under which palladium quantities equal to the  ounces of palladium received in the norilsk nickel stock purchase transaction will be sold over a period of two years  primarily for use in automobile catalytic converters 
under these agreements  the company is expected to sell approximately  ounces of palladium per month  ending in the first quarter of  at a slight volume discount to the market price at the time of delivery 
under one of these agreements  the company also will sell  ounces of platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month also at a slight discount to market prices 
the company from time to time may need to purchase platinum and rhodium in the open market to fulfill this monthly delivery obligation 
see business and properties pgm sales and hedging activities and note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s open positions at december  during the third quarter of  the major us bond rating agencies downgraded the corporate ratings of general motors corporation and ford motor company  two of the customers pursuant to the company s long term sales contracts 
as a result  the debt of these companies no longer qualifies as investment grade 
the company s business is substantially dependent on its contracts with ford and general motors  particularly because the floor prices in these contracts are significantly greater than the market price of palladium 
under applicable law  these contracts may be void or voidable if general motors or ford becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy 
the loss of either of these contracts could require the company to sell at prevailing market prices  which might expose it to lower metal prices as compared to the floor prices under the contracts 
in such an event  the company s operating plans could be threatened 
in addition  under the company s credit facility  a default or modification of these contracts could prohibit additional loans or require the immediate repayment of outstanding loans 
thus  termination of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and viability 
the company enters into fixed forwards and financially settled forwards that are accounted for as cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities 
in the fixed forward transactions  normally metals contained in the spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are received and are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
financially settled forwards may be used as a mechanism to hedge against fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production 
under financially settled forwards  at each settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
the company s financially settled forwards are settled at maturity 
as of december   the company was party to financially settled forward agreements covering approximately of its anticipated platinum sales from mine production for the period from january through june these transactions are designed to hedge a total of  ounces of platinum sales from mine production for the next thirty months at an overall average price of approximately per ounce 
the company enters into fixed forwards and financially settled forwards relating to pgm recycling of catalyst materials 
these transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these sales of metals derived from processing spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time of receipt and delivered against the cash flow hedges when the ounces are recovered 
all of these open transactions will settle at various periods through march see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the unrealized loss on these instruments related to pgm recycling due to changes in metal prices at december   was million and million at december  until these contracts mature  any net change in the value of the hedging instrument due to changes in metal prices is reflected in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a net unrealized loss of million on these instruments existed at december   and is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
because these hedges are highly effective  when these instruments are settled any remaining gain or loss on the cash flow hedges will be offset by losses or gains on the future metal sale and will be recognized at that time in operating income 
all commodity instruments outstanding at december   are expected to be settled within the next thirty months
