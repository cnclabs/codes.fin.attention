item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview during  we made significant investments in new production facilities  expanded our us direct sales force and increased research and development efforts 
in  we completed the construction of our new molding  technology  and logistic facility mtl in south jordan  utah  and purchased a new facility in chester  virginia  for the medsource procedure tray business that we acquired during the fourth quarter of these facilities  along with facilities completed in galway  ireland and south jordan  utah during  were developed to meet production demands for anticipated future sales growth 
also  during we added additional research and development staff and created a new pilot production clean room to support new product launches 
during  we also released several new products  including the prelude sheath introducer  viceroy inflation device  backstop plus and minstop plus safety devices 
we plan to release three new products in the first half of  the revolution securement device  the impress radiology catheter and the honor hemostasis valve 
in an effort to promote future sales growth and improve market penetration  we hired new sales people for our us domestic direct sales force during we believe despite the temporary effects of these investments on earnings  they were needed to position us for potential future sales growth and earnings 
for the year ended december   we reported net sales of million  up million or over the comparable period in net sales growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of our stand alone products and our new procedure tray business 
gross margins as a percentage of sales were down to for the year ended december   compared to for year ended december  this decline resulted primarily from new facilities and equipment  increased cost of direct labor  higher overhead expenses and negative margins in the new procedure tray business acquired 
sales of procedure trays contributed to the company s total sales for net income decreased for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the prior year period 
when compared to the prior year period  net income for the year ended december  was positively affected by increased sales volumes  and negatively affected by lower gross margins  higher research and development spending  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations income before income tax expense net income our net sales increased by million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in  and an increase of million  or  in we report sales in five product categories 
listed below are the sales relating to these product categories for the years ended december   and twelve months ended december  change change change inflation devices custom kits stand alone devices catheters procedure trays total our revenues increased notwithstanding the fact that the markets for many of our products are experiencing slight pricing declines as our customers try to reduce costs 
substantially all of the increase in our revenues was attributable to increased unit sales  except for a slight increase in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar which increased sales by 
in compared to  in compared to  in compared to unit growth for   and resulted primarily from a procedural growth rate of approximately 
in addition  unit growth in  and was attributable  in part  to our introduction of new products which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  for total sales for such periods  with the remainder of unit growth coming from market share gains 
international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  and international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales 
these increases were primarily a result of greater acceptance of our products in international markets  ongoing growth in our european direct sales  and increased sales related to improvement in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  as discussed above 
our total direct sales in france  germany  the uk  belgium  the netherlands and ireland were million and million and million in   and  respectively 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was  and  in   and  respectively 
the decline in gross margins in resulted primarily from new facilities and equipment  increased cost of direct labor  higher overhead expenses ie utilities  maintenance  cleaning and taxes and new product launches 
the decline in gross margins for was also affected by negative margins in the new procedure tray business we acquired from medsource during the fourth quarter of the effect was a reduction of gross margins by for sales of procedure trays contributed to the company s total sales for the slight decrease in gross margin percentage in  compared to  was the result of a slight increase in the standard costs per unit as the result of increased manufacturing costs 
the increase in the gross margin percentage for over was primarily effected by an increase in efficiency and productivity gains achieved primarily our operations groups 
these productivity gains have been achieved primarily by enhanced employee productivity  which we believe was encouraged by our bonus program  streamlined production layouts and investments in manufacturing equipment 
with these improved efficiencies  our cost per unit for many of our products has decreased as unit sales have grown  notwithstanding slight increases in fixed overhead costs 
gross profit was also favorable for over by an increase in the exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar  resulting in an increase in gross profit of and  respectively 
during  we reduced the material costs from some of its principal vendors 
we are operating in a gradually declining price market 
during  we expect gross margins to decline as a result of higher overhead expenses attributable to absorbing the new buildings and associated overhead costs  growth of lower margin pack sales of medsource  and bringing on several new products until sales volumes increase to cover overhead costs 
we believe  however  that if we are successful in increasing production volumes according to current sales plans  the increased production will offset some of the effect of the lower margins 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in over  million  or in over  million  or in over the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was due primarily to costs associated with severance for employees  the buy out of a distribution agreement  the hiring of additional sales people  and the sample expense related to new product introductions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs for  compared to  was primarily the result of approximately  in costs associated with our efforts to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and severance costs of approximately  related to the termination of certain employees 
the additional expenditures for over were related to increases in commissions paid commensurate with sales growth  costs of expanding our direct sales force in the united states and europe  and an increased exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar compared to the same period in  resulting in an increase in selling expenses for our direct sales force in europe 
our research and development r d expenses for increased to million  compared to million in  increased to million  compared to million in  increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in r d in   and was related primarily to r d head count additions and indirect costs  to support an increase in the number of new products we launched 
our research and development costs as a percentage of sales were for and for and we believe that the development of projects at any given time is an appropriate level of r d for our current capabilities  and are likely to provide six to eight new products a year through r d  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing  and sales introduction 
our effective tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for over was the result of the reimbursement by the us parent of costs incurred by its irish operation for the development of two new products which are taxed at a lower income tax rate than the us the increase in the effective tax rate for over was mostly due to lower taxable income in for our irish operations  which are taxed at a lower rate than our us operations 
the change in taxable income for irish operations from to was the result of increased costs associated with the development of a new product 
our other operating income for was the result of a gain of  on sale of land adjacent to our company s south jordan  utah facility 
our other income for   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease in other income for over was affected by a net decrease in a litigation settlement of  an increase in foreign currency transaction loss of approximately  and a decrease in interest income of approximately  the decrease in other income for over was affected by a net decrease in a litigation settlement of approximately  offset by an increase in of interest income of approximately  the increase in other income for over related mostly to the settlement of a legal dispute of  an increase in interest income of approximately  and a decrease in interest expense of approximately  compared to the same period in our net income for was million  compared to million for net income for was million  compared to million for net income for was million  compared to million for net income for and was negatively affected by lower gross margins  higher research and development spending  selling  general and administrative expenses  and positively affected by increased sales volumes 
net income for and was favorably affected by higher sales  gross profits and an increase in other income 
under the recently issued financial accounting standard board statement fasb no 
r  share based payment  we will be required to apply the expense recognition provisions of this pronouncement to equity based incentives such as stock options 
in anticipation of this pronouncement  during and we made grants to management and employees for a total of  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  which vested immediately upon grant  rather than over five years as has been our historical practice 
additionally  subsequent to december   we accelerated the vesting on  options with an exercise price of  which was in excess of the current market price 
the immediate vesting of options and the acceleration of options which have exercise prices that are above the current market value of our common stock are anticipated to reduce our compensation expense by approximately million and million  respectively  in future periods under the provisions of fas no 
r  which we believe is in the best interest of merit and its shareholders 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill from business acquisitions  but review annually the impairment of goodwill  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed its initial testing of goodwill as of january  and determined that there was no impairment 
we have elected to perform our annual testing of goodwill impairment as of july of the applicable fiscal year 
as of july   we updated our testing of goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no impairment 
the unamortized amount of goodwill at december   was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources capital commitments the following table summarizes our capital commitments and contractual obligations as of december   including long term debt  operating lease payments  and office lease payments  as well as the future periods in which such payments are currently anticipated to become due payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases royalty obligations total contractual cash obligations additional information regarding our capital commitments and contractual obligations  including royalty payments  is contained in notes   and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  set forth in item our working capital for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in working capital for and over the comparable periods of and  respectively  was primarily the result of cash being used to fund the construction of our new facilities in south jordan  utah  and galway  ireland  the purchase of and remodel of our facility in chester  virginia  and the acquisitions of mctec  medsource and sub q 
the increases in working capital for over was primarily due to an increase in our cash balance of million in and million in as of december   we had a current ratio of to we had outstanding under our line of credit at december  we assumed some capital leases with the purchase of the medsource assets  with an outstanding balance of approximately  at december  we generated cash from operations for   and in the amount of million  million  and million respectively 
we maintain a long term revolving credit facility the facility with a bank  which currently enables us to borrow funds at variable interest rates 
the facility was voluntarily reduced to  in august the facility expires on june  we are currently in discussions with a different bank for a line of credit for million  subject to a favorable credit review 
historically  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with product development and introduction of new products 
substantial capital has also been required to finance the increase in our receivables and inventories associated with our increased sales 
during  we paid approximately million for payments to complete the construction of our new mtl building and cafeteria expansion in south jordan  utah 
in addition  during  we spent  approximately million to purchase a  square foot facility and add a clean room in chester  virginia  and million to purchase seven acres of land just west of our current south jordan  utah facilities 
also during  significant investments were made for new equipment including approximately million in molding equipment  approximately million for an automated warehouse shipping system  and approximately million for automated production equipment 
our principal source of funding for these and other expenses has been cash generated from operations  sales of equity  cash from loans on equipment  and bank lines of credit 
we currently believe that our present sources of liquidity and capital are adequate for current operations and for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ  and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development  and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve our management reviews on a regular basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on estimates of forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve has been an historically accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
our obsolescence reserve was approximately million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our receivables are with hospitals  which over our history  have demonstrated favorable collection rates 
therefore  we have experienced relatively minimal bad debts from hospital customers 
in limited circumstances we have written off minimal bad debts as the result of the termination of foreign distributors 
the most significant write offs over our history have come from us packers who bundle our products in surgical trays 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our bad debt reserve was  at december   which is in line with historical collection experience 
stock based compensation we account for our stock compensation arrangements under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for our stock compensation arrangements 
if the compensation cost for our compensation plans had been determined consistent with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our net income and net income per common and common share equivalent would have changed to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands except per share data net income as reported compensation cost under fair value based accounting method net of tax net income pro forma net income per common share basic as reported pro forma diluted as reported pro forma in applying the black scholes methodology to the option grants  we used the following assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected option life years years years expected price volatility for options with a vesting period  compensation expense is recognized on a ratable basis over the service period which corresponds to the vesting period 
compensation expense is recognized immediately for options that are fully vested on the date of grant 
on february   we accelerated the vesting of  options with an exercise price of  which was in excess of the current market price 
the acceleration of these options increased the pro forma compensation cost for the twelve months ended december  by approximately million  net of tax 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro and great britain pound gbp relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of our revenues million  representing approximately of aggregate revenues  for the year ended december  was attributable to sales that were denominated in euros and gbps 
certain of our expenses are also denominated in euros and gbps  which partially offsets risks associated with fluctuations of exchanges rates between the euro and gbp on the one hand  and the us dollar on the other hand 
because of our euro and gbp denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which our euro and gbp denominated revenues exceed our euro and gbp based expenses  the value of such euro and gbp denominated net income increases if the value of the euro and gbp increase relative to the value of the us dollar  and decreases if the value of the euro and gbp decrease relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate between the euro and gbp against the us dollar resulted in an increase of our gross revenues of approximately  and in gross profit 
at december   we had a net exposure representing the difference between euro and gbp denominated receivables and euro and gbp denominated payables of approximately million and  respectively 
in order to partially offset such risks  at november   we entered into day forward contract for euro and gbp 
we generally enter into similar economic transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks we bear throughout the year 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during the year ended december  and we experienced a net loss of approximately  and  respectively  on these transactions executed during and in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro and gbp against the us dollar exchange rate 
another market risk relates to variable rate debt 
as of december   we had no variable rate debt 
as long as we do not have variable rate debt  our interest expense would not be affected by changes in interest rates
