item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth above under the caption business risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes appearing in part ii item of this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with a primary focus on the discovery  development and commercialization of drugs to treat neurological disease and disorders 
our most advanced product candidate  nxy formerly known as cerovive  is a novel free radical trapping neuroprotectant in phase iii clinical trails for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with our exclusive licensee  astrazeneca ab astrazeneca 
upon commercialization of nxy we are entitled to receive mid teen royalties on worldwide net sales 
astrazeneca is responsible for funding and conducting all of the clinical trials with nxy as well as all activities related to manufacturing and commercialization 
we are currently conducting drug discovery programs in the areas of neurprotection  pain and inflammatory diseases 
in addition to the relationship with astrazeneca  we have a collaboration with pfizer  inc pfizer to discover and develop product candidates targeting the vanilloid receptor  vr  and a collaboration with genentech  inc genentech in the areas of nerve growth and anti angiogenesis 
in addition to these partnered programs  we are independently pursuing drug discovery programs targeted at next generation cytoprotectants that act similarly to nxy and certain purinergic receptors that are implicated in a broad spectrum of pain and inflammatory diseases 
in may  our exclusive licensee  astrazeneca  initiated two multi national  multi center  randomized  double blinded phase iii clinical trials saint i and saint ii to test nxy versus placebo in acute ischemic stroke patients 
in may  we announced top line results from saint i in coordination with astrazeneca 
these results showed that the saint i trial involving more than  patients was the first international phase iii trial of a neuroprotectant in acute ischemic stroke to meet its primary endpoint 
in saint i  nxy showed a statistically significantly reduced disability compared to placebo as measured on the modified rankin scale mrs at days p  when given within hours of stroke onset in a broad range of stroke patients 
the clinical benefit was evident at the earliest time point assessed days and persisted through the end of the study days 
we also announced that the prespecified analysis of neurological recovery as measured on the national institute of health stroke scale nihss  did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups 
the clinical significance of these findings will be assessed in light of the outcome of the ongoing global phase iii trial saint ii planned to involve approximately  patients 
in august  astrazeneca initiated a global phase iib trial chant to assess safety and tolerability of nxy in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage ich 
in march  we announced  in coordination with astrazeneca  preliminary results from the phase iib chant which involved patients from countries 
an analysis of the data showed that the safety and tolerability of nxy was similar to placebo  with comparable mortality rates in each group and no difference between the nxy and placebo groups on the secondary endpoint of stroke outcomes after ich in the study 
previously in  we were independently conducting clinical trials with two product candidates known as ren and ren in august  we announced our decision to discontinue development of ren as an oral medication based upon the modest effectiveness observed at the maximum dose tested in our phase ii studies  and safety findings that would limit testing of higher oral doses 
in june  we announced our decision to end future development of ren based on a review of interim data from a phase ia study 
we have a limited history of operations 
since our inception we have generated all of our revenues from agreements with corporate partners 
during  we recorded million in contract revenue related to milestone payments that we received from astrazeneca following their receipt of regulatory approval to 
table of contents commence phase iii trials for nxy upon achievement of certain future milestones involving the filing and approval of marketing applications in the us and us or japan  astrazeneca is obligated to make additional payments to us totaling up to million 
in december  we entered into a collaborative research  development and license agreement with genentech for the discovery and development of drugs that inhibit pathological or tumor angiogenesis and promote nerve re growth following nervous system injury 
under the terms of the agreement  genentech paid us an upfront license and technology access fee of approximately million in january and made a million equity purchase concurrent with our initial public offering 
we deferred the upfront payment and are recognizing it as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period 
in july  we revised the estimated completion date of the research period under the agreement to february from our previous estimate of december we recognized million and million related to this agreement during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the funded research period under this agreement ended in february the agreement with genentech remains in effect after february and we will continue to coordinate research efforts through the joint research committee that was set up to guide the program 
we are also eligible to receive future milestones and royalty payments on therapeutic products emerging from the collaboration that are developed and commercialized by genentech 
in exchange  genentech obtained exclusive worldwide rights to research  develop  manufacture and commercialized protein based therapeutics and other drug compositions for the treatment of cancer and other diseases in which mechanisms underlying new blood vessel growth play a significant role 
unless genentech exercises certain rights and makes additional payments to us  we will have the right to develop and commercialize products arising from the collaboration that are specifically useful for the treatment of central and peripheral nervous system diseases and conditions 
we would be required to make royalty payments  and in certain cases milestone payments  to genentech on products that we develop and commercialize under the collaboration 
in may  we entered into a collaborative research agreement and a license and royalty agreement with pfizer to research  develop and commercialize small molecule compounds that target the vanilloid receptor  vr the collaboration focuses on treatments for pain  urinary incontinence and other diseases and disorders 
under the agreement  we received an upfront license fee of million in july we have deferred the upfront license fee and are recognizing it as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period of two years 
in addition to the upfront license fee  the pfizer collaboration also provides us with research funding in excess of million which is being recognized over the estimated research period 
accordingly  we recognized million in contract revenue related to these agreements during the year ended december  pfizer has the option to extend the agreements for up to two additional years subject to additional funding requirements 
additionally  we will be eligible to receive research  development  approval and commercialization milestone payments resulting in total potential payments to the company greater than million through successful achievement of research development and commercialization milestones for each product resulting from the collaboration 
upon commercialization of a product resulting from the collaboration  we will be entitled to receive royalties on net sales by pfizer 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for more than the next months 
however  changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume our capital resources sooner than we expect 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development programs  and advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs 
in addition  we may acquire or in license technology and products and may also acquire or invest in businesses that are complementary to our own 

table of contents revenues to date  all of our revenue has been earned under agreements with astrazeneca  genentech and pfizer 
we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales or royalties until at least  if at all 
we seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  upfront fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships  as well as those we may receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
revenue derived from collaborative and strategic relationships helps us fund our operations and may increase in the future if we are successful in achieving milestones in our existing collaborations  licensing our technology and establishing new collaborations or strategic relationships 
if we are unsuccessful in these goals  our revenues will decline and we may be required to limit our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research  preclinical development and clinical trials involving product opportunities in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and inflammatory diseases 
we do not incur research and development costs for nxy  which is licensed exclusively to astrazeneca 
the expenses we incur in connection with our research  preclinical and clinical development consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants  contract research and clinical trials including non cash expenses for options granted to non employees  license fees  facilities and overhead costs  funded r d at other companies and research institutions  manufacturing of clinical drug supplies  and depreciation of equipment 
r d costs  including some upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators  are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in our future r d expenses 
we are unable to estimate the portion of costs incurred that are allocable to the individual research activities we have conducted because we do not segregate costs among early stage research programs for both management and external reporting 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred research and development expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the total r d costs related to individual research activities are as follows in millions for the year ended december  clinical development activities preclinical r d programs 
table of contents the decrease in clinical development expenses in as compared to is a result of our decisions to end two clinical development programs  both of which involved multiple phase ii clinical studies that were ongoing throughout preclinical r d expenses  on the other hand  increased in from as a result of growth of our research programs in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and inflammatory diseases 
during the period  we made significant new investments to add key personnel in chemistry and pharmacology to support expansion of our preclinical programs  including our program with pfizer to identify vr antagonists  as well as external studies needed to support advancement of ren into clinical development during the first half of we also maintained our effort to identify and advance molecules with properties similar to nxy that we believe could be useful in a range of ischemic conditions and we invested in certain pilot programs to build our pipeline of new investment opportunities within the company 
our clinical development efforts during were focused exclusively on initiating and conducting multiple phase ii clinical trials with ren and ren we discontinued clinical development activities involving ren and ren during and  respectively 
our preclinical r d activities during included toxicology and efficacy studies of various development candidates in preclinical models of pain and inflammatory disease as well as formulation and manufacturing of drug supply for these studies 
the preclinical r d amount of million was expended primarily on employee costs  supplies and materials and infrastructure related to neurobiology  chemistry  cell biology and related functions associated with our earlier stage research programs 
our clinical development efforts during were primarily related to activities required to advance ren and ren to ind filings with the fda and into clinical trials that commenced in the second half of and the first quarter of  respectively 
the preclinical r d amount of million was expended primarily on employee costs  supplies and materials and infrastructure related to neurobiology  chemistry and related functions associated with our earlier stage research programs 
development timelines and costs are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly for each product candidate and from quarter to quarter 
the process of seeking regulatory approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including finance  human resources and business development 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we anticipate incurring increases in general and administrative expenses  such as increased costs for compliance with certain sections of the sarbanes oxley act of  insurance and investor relations 
these increases will also likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company s revenues are generated by complex collaborative research and licensing arrangements 
revenues under such agreements may include upfront payments  research funding  milestone payments and royalties 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the delivered element under these arrangements has value to our collaborative partner or licensee on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered element exists 
arrangements with multiple deliverables that do not meet these criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for the purposes of revenue recognition 
revenues from nonrefundable upfront technology license fees  for product candidates where we are providing continuing services related to product development  are deferred and recognized as revenues ratably over the estimated period of performance under the research agreement 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is periodically reevaluated 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized which would result in an acceleration or delay of expected revenue recognition 
research funding is recognized as revenue as the related effort is performed 
milestone payments we receive under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenues upon achievements of the milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner or licensee 
accordingly  the milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone as the milestone payments we receive are nonrefundable 
stock compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the information regarding net loss as required by sfas no 
has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  other models that may be developed in the future may generate fair value that differ from those calculated based on the black scholes valuation model 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january  generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

table of contents under sfas no 
r  option grants are generally valued at the grant date and those valuations do not change once they have been established 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense we expect to record in will be based largely upon the amortization of costs for awards granted in and prior periods 
this portion of our stock based compensation expense will be fairly predictable and is expected to be similar to our historical pro forma disclosures 
however  because of the variability in the assumptions to be used in the valuation of stock options we may grant in and the variability in the quantity and other terms of stock based awards we may issue in  our ability to predict the stock based compensation expense is limited 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our results of operations and financial condition and although the adoption of sfas no 
r will have no impact on our overall financial position  it will have a material impact on our results of operations in the first quarter of and in future quarters 
as required by sfas no 
r  unamortized deferred compensation at december  will be reversed out of stockholder s equity in connection with the company s adoption of sfas no 
r in january compensation expense for stock options that were granted prior to  but not vested as of december  will be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations starting in january in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r as the related options vest 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development relates primarily to purchased in licensed technology  intellectual property and know how 
we evaluate the stage of development of acquired projects  taking into account the level of effort  time and estimated cost associated with further developing the in process technology and producing a commercial product 
the remaining efforts for completion of acquired in process research and development projects generally include completion of clinical trials  completion of manufacturing validation  interpretation of clinical and preclinical data and obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory bodies  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to determine 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with timely completion of development projects  including clinical trial results  manufacturing process development results  and ongoing feedback from regulatory authorities  including obtaining marketing approval 
in addition  acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals  the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting  changes in the reimbursement environment or the introduction of new competitive products 
as a result of the uncertainties noted above  we expense such acquired in process research and development projects when incurred 
clinical study activities and other expenses from third party contract research organizations some of our research and development  including certain clinical study activity  is conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
we recognize expenses for these contracted activities based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers  and adjustments are made accordingly 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the twelve months ended december   and revenue total revenue and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the years ended december  and are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  pfizer collaboration genentech collaboration astrazeneca license total revenue dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease the increase in revenue in as compared to resulted from a collaborative research agreement and a license and royalty agreement with pfizer that we signed in may under the agreements we received an upfront license fee of million in july we recorded the upfront license fee as deferred revenue and are recognizing it as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period of two years 
in addition to the upfront license fee  the agreements with pfizer also provide the company with total research funding of more than million during the two year research period 
the decrease in revenue in as compared to occurred because we earned a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in following fda approval to begin phase iii clinical trials with nxy and did not earn any milestone payments from astrazeneca in our revenue in resulted from a collaboration agreement which we entered into with genentech at the end of under this agreement  we received an upfront payment of million that we are recognizing as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period of the agreement 
in july  we revised the estimated completion date of the research period under the agreement with genentech to february from december accordingly  we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue on a straight line basis through february we expect that any revenue we may earn will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of and amount of any milestone payments we earn or any new collaborations we may enter into in the future 
for the year ending december   we presently anticipate contract revenue from existing agreements of million to million 
this estimate includes approximately million from our collaboration with genentech related to the completion of the research period under our agreement in february research and development expenses total research and development expenses and dollar and percentage change as compared to the years ended december  and are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total r d expense dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease the decrease in r d expense in as compared to was primarily due to our decisions to end two clinical development programs  both of which involved multiple phase ii clinical studies that were on going 
table of contents throughout  which was partially offset by increases as a result of our investment in our preclinical activities in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and inflammatory diseases 
specific changes included external clinical trial costs  manufacturing cost of clinical trial supplies and other costs related to pharmacology and in vivo studies decreased by million primarily due to our decisions to end two clinical development programs involving ren and ren and cancellations of certain other clinical projects  employee related expense increased by million due to increased headcount and increases in merit pay  partially offset by decreases in recruiting and relocation related expenses  and facilities and other shared expense increased by million due to increased headcount in allocated cost centers such as information technology and increased building operating expenses including utilities and other shared costs 
the increase in r d expense in as compared to was primarily due to increased clinical development activities 
we advanced ren and ren into phase ii clinical trials during the second half of and the first quarter of  respectively  and conducted multiple phase ii clinical trials with both product candidates during most of also in  we conducted preclinical studies with ren to support filing an ind and advancing the drug candidate into a phase i clinical trial that commenced in the first quarter of in addition  we made new investments in expanding our research programs in the areas of neuroprotection and pain during specific changes included external clinical trial costs increased by million as a direct result of multiple clinical trials with ren and ren that were ongoing during most of  employee costs increased by million as we added r d personnel to expand our capabilities in assay development  chemistry  pharmacology  and clinical development 
these new employees were integral to progress in our research programs in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and inflammation as well as conduct of the clinical trials with ren and ren employee costs also increased due to annual merit pay increases and rising employee benefit costs  outside service costs increased by million as we utilized third parties to assist with preclinical development of ren and the conduct of clinical trials with ren and ren  license fees increased by million in connection with the licensing of intellectual property for use in our preclinical development programs  including a one time fee that we paid to cutanix corporation cutanix to secure exclusive rights to certain chemical compounds that were previously subject to limited development and commercialization rights held by cutanix  laboratory supplies and related material costs increased by million as a result of the expansion of our preclinical programs in neuroprotection  pain and inflammatory diseases  and amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the centaur acquisition increased by million primarily due to additional contingent consideration that was recognized in may as all earn out conditions related to the asset acquisition were met 
we recorded a portion of the additional contingent consideration as an intangible asset in the second quarter of which resulted in additional quarterly amortization expense commencing in the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing expense of million in in our manufacturing effort was limited to production of ren for preclinical studies and phase i clinical trials that we initiated in february in we incurred greater manufacturing expenses as we contracted with outside parties to manufacture drug supplies for our phase ii clinical trials with ren and ren excluded from research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  of employee stock based compensation 
table of contents which is reported under a separate caption see further discussion below under amortization of employee stock based compensation 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we move preclinical products into clinical trials 
however  we currently do not have estimates of total costs of clinical trials nor the cost to reach regulatory approval for any drug candidate as all drug candidates are subject to an uncertain and lengthy regulatory process which may not result in obtaining the necessary regulatory approval 
we also expect compensation expense to increase in future periods following our adoption of sfas no

purchased in process research and development in process research and development expense recorded in related to our acquisition of pharmaceutical assets and intellectual property from centaur pharmaceuticals  inc in december and the related purchase price allocation 
in the second quarter of we recorded an expense of million upon the commencement of phase iii clinical trials for nxy by astrazeneca  which triggered a contingent payment of additional shares of our series d preferred stock to centaur 
the principal technology acquired as part of the centaur acquisition related to nxy and ren that were in the process of being developed

table of contents interest expense total interest expense and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the years ended december  and are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total interest expense dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease interest expense was nominally higher in than in interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily due to the lower aggregate interest rates on our debt balances related to the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
financial guidance we expect our operating expenses to increase as we move preclinical products into clinical trials 
for the year ending december   the company presently anticipates total contract revenue from existing agreements of million to million 
this estimate includes approximately million from our collaboration with genentech related to the completion of the research period under our agreement in february  and total operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation to be recognized upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  of million to million 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as well as through equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
as of december   we had received approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in february  we received approximately million from our initial public offering of common stock and concurrent private placement with genentech 
in september  we completed a public offering of common stock under which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  since inception to december   we financed the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements with debt totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at that date 
these obligations are secured by the purchased equipment and leasehold improvements  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to and are due in monthly installments through december as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase resulted primarily from the closing of our public offering of common stock in september  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  and payments totaling million that we received from pfizer under our vr collaboration  including an upfront license fee of million that we received in july these sources of cash were partially offset by cash used in operating activities and principal payments on outstanding debt related to capital purchases 
our cash and investments are invested in a diversified portfolio of financial instruments  including money market instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government or governmental agency securities and other debt securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million in the corresponding period in the million decrease in cash used in operations in primarily reflected a decrease in net operating loss of million as a result of an increase in contract revenue and a decrease in research and development expenses 
the decrease in net operating loss was partially offset by an increase in the change of deferred revenue from million in to million in net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million in the corresponding period in net cash used in investing activities in and resulted primarily from capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million in the corresponding period in and primarily reflected net proceeds of million received from issuance of common stock through our public offering in september  million in proceeds received from issuance of common stock upon option exercises and espp purchases  and million in proceeds received from financing of equipment purchased through our existing credit facilities partially offset by principal payments of million on these financings 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected net proceeds received from the completion of our initial public offering and concurrent private placement with genentech of million  and million in proceeds received from financing of equipment purchased through our existing credit facilities partially offset by principal payments of million on these financings 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter operating leases equipment financing interest related to equipment financing total we have entered into a variety of license agreements relating to our research and development efforts  most of which relate to product candidates in the early stage of preclinical development 
we have a cancelable license agreement relating to our product candidate in clinical trials  nxy under this agreement  we are required to pay  annually in minimum royalty payments through nda approval and  annually in minimum royalty payments after nda approval 
additionally  low single digit royalties are payable on net product sales 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of preclinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies  the number of product candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our plans to establish sales  marketing and or manufacturing capabilities  
table of contents our ability to establish  enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances and activities required for product commercialization  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development and commercialization of our products 
based upon our current operating plan we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for more than the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources 
we will be required to seek additional sources of funding to complete development and commercialization of our products 
when we raise funds in the future  we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that the funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to be able to sell from time to time up to million worth of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants 
the sec declared this registration statement effective in may any actual sale will be offered using a prospectus in amounts  at prices and at terms determined at the time of an offering and may be sold directly by us to investors  through agents  or through underwriters or dealers 
in september  we sold  shares of common stock to the public at per share for gross proceeds of million 
as of december   million remains available for issuance under this registration statement

r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

table of contents the company has elected to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company has accounted for share based payments to employees using apb no 
opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
under sfas no 
r  option grants are generally valued at the grant date and those valuations do not change once they have been established 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense we expect to record in will be based largely upon the amortization of costs for awards granted in and prior periods 
this portion of our stock based compensation expense will be fairly predictable and is expected to be similar to our historical pro forma disclosures 
however  because of the variability in the assumptions to be used in the valuation of stock options we may grant in and the variability in the quantity and other terms of stock based awards we may issue in  our ability to predict the stock based compensation expense is limited 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our results of operations and financial condition and although the adoption of sfas no 
r will have no impact on our overall financial position  it will have a material impact on our results of operations in the first quarter of and in future quarters 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp no 
fas provides additional guidance on the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of the loss 
although fsp no 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   we believe the fsp s clarification to the guidance regarding when an other than temporary impairment should be recognized is consistent with other existing literature  such as staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  and has been applied as of december  we do not expect the adoption of fsp to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
