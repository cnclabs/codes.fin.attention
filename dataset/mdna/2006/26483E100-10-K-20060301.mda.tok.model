business segments we currently manage and report our business globally through two business segments united states which consists solely of our united states or us operations  and international which consists of our operations in canada  europe  asia pacific  and latin america

our sales force we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our customers solutions  of which approximately  are in our us segment and are in our international segment as of december  our sales force includes relationship managers and solution specialists who sell to our higher revenue customers  teams of telesales people who sell to our lower revenue customers and a team that sells to resellers of our solutions and our data 
we deliver our solutions primarily through the web and other electronic methods  including desktop and enterprise application software  as well as through third party resellers and enterprise software vendors 
our customers our principal customers are banks and other credit and financial institutions  major manufacturers and wholesalers  insurance companies and telecommunication companies 
the principal customers for our e business solutions are sales  marketing and business development professionals 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue or of the revenue of our us or international business segments 
accordingly  neither we nor either of our business segments is dependent on a single customer or a few customers  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations or the annual results of either of our business segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
a number of competitors are active in specific aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright quality process 
in the us  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of market share and revenue  including revenue from sales of third party business credit information 
we compete with our customers own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers risk management processes in order to capture more of their internal spend 
we also directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc experian  which have traditionally offered primarily consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete in the us with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions as well as our customers own purchasing departments 
in our sales marketing solutions business  our direct competitors include companies such as experian and infousa  inc infousa 
in our supply management solutions business  we directly compete with consulting firms  specialty data providers and specialty software companies 
in our e business solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of the customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s pro  hoover s pro plus and hoover s pro premium products compete with other business information providers 
table of contents such as infousa 
on the lower end of product pricing  our hoover s lite solution mainly competes with advertising supported websites and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and cbs marketwatch 
outside the us  the competitive environment varies by country  and in some countries we are a market leader 
for example  in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as cerved in italy and experian in the united kingdom uk 
in addition  common links exist among some of these competitors through their membership in european information network alliances  such as bignet experian  and we believe that competitors may be pursuing the establishment of their own pan european network through direct investment  which could ultimately be positioned by them as an alternative to our d b worldwide network 
however  we believe we offer superior solutions when compared to these networks because of our dunsright quality process 
in addition  the sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
we also face significant competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our brand  our financial flexibility and our winning culture form a powerful competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring and sources of data not publicly available  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  and attract and retain a high performing workforce 
intellectual property we own and control various intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  confidential information  trademarks  trade names  copyrights  patents and applications therefor 
these rights  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
we also believe that each of the d b name and related trade names  marks and logos are of material importance to our business 
we are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others  and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 
we consider our trademarks  service marks  databases  software  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary  and we rely on a combination of statutory eg  copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent  etc 
and contract and liability safeguards for protection thereof throughout the world 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this annual report on form k are trademarks  service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries 
we own patents and patent applications both in the us and in other selected countries of strategic importance to us 
the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection 
we believe that the protection of our innovative technology  especially technology pertaining to our proprietary dunsright quality process  
table of contents through the filing of patent applications is a prudent business strategy and we will continue to seek to protect those assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital 
filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology 
however  these patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us 
where appropriate  we may also consider asserting or cross licensing our patents 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  team members worldwide  of which approximately  were in our us segment and corporate and approximately  were in our international segment 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
there are no unions in our us segment 
workers councils and trade unions represent a portion of our employees in the european and latin american operations of our international segment

item a 
risk factors our business model is dependent upon third parties to provide data and certain operational services  the loss of which would materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely significantly on third parties to support our business model 
for example we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  including public record sources  we partner with single source providers in certain countries that support the needs of our customers around the globe and rely on our strategic partners in our d b worldwide network to provide local data in countries in which we do not directly operate  we have outsourced various functions  such as our technology help desk and network management functions in the us and in the uk  and 
table of contents we have also outsourced certain portions of our data acquisition and delivery  customer service and some financial processes  such as cash collections and accounts payable 
if one or more data providers were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  or not adhere to our data quality standards  our ability to provide solutions and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
similarly  if one of our outsource providers  including our strategic partners  were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us would suffer or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all  materially impacting our business and financial results 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we could replace our large third party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
large web search engine companies can provide low cost alternatives to data gathering and change how our customers perform key activities such as marketing campaigns 
such companies  and other third parties which may not be readily apparent today  may become significant low cost competitors and adversely impact the demand for our solutions and services 
weak economic conditions also can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we are facing increased competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information solutions to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
in addition  consumer information companies are seeking to expand their operations more broadly into aspects of the business information space 
while their presence is currently small in the business information market  given the size of the consumer market in which they play  they have scale advantages in terms of scope of operations and size of relationship with customers  which they can potentially leverage to an advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based upon a number of factors including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring  and sources of data not publicly available  demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth  deliver reliable and high quality business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  
table of contents attract and retain a high performing workforce  enhance our existing services and introduce new services  and improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management of strategic partner relationships in our international segment that are part of our d b worldwide network 
we may not be able to successfully complete undertaking various initiatives in our international segment that are critical to increasing our international revenues and enhancing our operating margins 
we are undertaking a number of initiatives in our international segment that are primarily focused on improving our competitive position  growing our revenues and improving our operating margins 
examples of initiatives we are currently undertaking or will seek to undertake in the near future include implementing subscription plan pricing for customers to increase their access to our risk management reports and data  to help them increase profitability while mitigating risk  improving the management of our d b worldwide network in order to  among other things  optimize revenue and profits realized by the sale of data collected by strategic partner organizations in certain markets  and implementing specific process re engineering projects designed to improve efficiency and productivity in our business 
these and other initiatives we undertake may not be successful in attaining a consistent and sustainable level of improved international financial performance 
for example  we may not be able to reduce costs of our operations through re engineering to the extent expected due to challenges in implementing our technology plans  or the efforts by our partner organizations to increase the value of the data they provide us may not result in significant improvements in data quality 
if we fail to improve the performance of our international segment  the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on annual contract renewals for a substantial part of our revenue and our quarterly results may be significantly impacted by the timing of these renewals 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  our results of operations from period to period may vary due to the timing of customer contract renewals 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may adversely impact our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data 
certain types of information we gather  compile and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in certain markets in which we operate  particularly in europe and other international markets 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new laws and regulations 
in general  compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date seriously affected our business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information  could affect our operations 
this could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue 
in addition  governmental agencies may seek  from time to time  to increase the fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data that such governmental agencies collect 
while we would seek to pass along any such price increases to our customers  there is no guarantee that we would be able to do 
table of contents so  given competitive pressures or other considerations 
in addition  any such price increases to our customers may result in reduced usage by our customers and or loss of market share 
we may be unable to achieve our revenue and earnings per share growth targets  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have established revenue and earnings per share growth targets for and aspirations for our growth is dependent upon successfully executing our strategy to reduce our expense base and reallocating a portion of the savings into new initiatives with higher revenue growth 
our initiatives and investments may not be sufficient to achieve and maintain such growth targets 
a failure to reach and maintain our desired revenue growth or our earnings per share growth targets could have a material adverse affect on the market value of our common stock 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our solutions  which could adversely impact our revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our solutions to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding both lower prices and more features from our solutions  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
if we do not successfully adapt our solutions to our customers preferences  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
specifically  for our larger customers  our continued success will be dependent on our ability to satisfy more of their needs by providing solutions beyond data  such as enhanced analytics and assisting with their data integration efforts 
for our smaller customers  our success will depend in part on our ability to simplify our solutions and pricing offerings and enhancing our marketing efforts to these customers 
to address customer needs for pricing certainty and increased access to our solutions  in the fourth quarter of we began to rollout a subscription pricing plan 
the subscription pricing plan provides expanded access to our risk management solutions in a way that provides more certainty over related costs to the customer  which in turn generally results in customers increasing their spend on our solutions 
this plan has been an important driver of our growth in our success moving forward is dependent  in part  on the continued penetration of this offering and the successful rollout of similar programs in various markets around the world 
similarly  our continued success is dependent on customers acceptance of dnbi 
our operations in the international segment are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries  which could adversely impact our operating results 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside the united states 
for the three years ended december   and  our international segment accounted for  and of total revenue 
our international business is subject to many challenges  the most significant being our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets  thus reducing the demand for our risk management solutions  and in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customers need to purchase our data 
our international strategy includes forming strategic partner relationships in certain markets with third parties to improve our data quality 
we form and manage these strategic partner alliances to create a competitive advantage for us over the long term  however  these strategic partnerships may not be successful 

table of contents the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various international markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment that could adversely impact aspects of our business or the business of our partners on whom we depend 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and strategic partnership alliances  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our solutions 
also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the business partners to whom we grant non exclusive licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
we may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
in addition  we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to our data centers  failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements  resulting in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigations that arise in the ordinary course of business 
as discussed in greater detail under note contingencies legal proceedings in notes to consolidated financial statements herein in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  certain of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 

table of contents we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth which would negatively impact our financial results 
successful execution of our blueprint for growth strategy includes reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives to produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to implement all of the actions required under this program within the established timeframe  our ability to implement actions which require process or technology changes to reduce our expense base  entering into or amending agreements with third party vendors to renegotiate terms beneficial to us  managing third party vendor relationships effectively  completing agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets  and maintaining quality around key business processes utilizing our reduced and or outsourced resources 
if we fail to reduce our expense base  or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth from new initiatives  the market value of our common stock may suffer 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could impact the quality of our performance and customer satisfaction 
our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel at all levels and to appropriately utilize the time and resources of such personnel 
competition for this personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
acquisitions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are subject to the following risks acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  and we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any acquisition

our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide 
we generally consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet current operating 
table of contents requirements  and most of the space is being utilized 
as of december   the most important of these other properties include the following sites a  square foot leased space in bethlehem  pennsylvania  which houses various sales  finance and data acquisition personnel approximately one third of this space is subleased to a third party  a  square foot office building that we own in parsippany  new jersey  housing personnel from our us sales  marketing and technology groups approximately one third of this space is leased to a third party  a  square foot office building that is leased in austin  texas  which houses a majority of hoover s employees  and a  square foot leased space in high wycombe  england  which houses operational and technology services for europe and serves as the executive office for our european operations 
in addition to the above locations  we also conduct operations from other offices located throughout the us  of which are leased  and non us office locations  of which are leased 
item legal proceedings we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of the uncertainties related to the probability of the outcome and or amount or range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of our liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from our currently recorded reserves and that such differences could be material 
based on our review of the latest information available  we believe our ultimate liability in connection with pending tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  with the possible exception of the matters described below 
in order to understand our exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between us and moody s corporation  our predecessors and other parties that  through various corporate reorganizations and contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation d b separated through a spin off into three separate public companies d b  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution 
this was accomplished through a spin off by d b of its stock in acnielsen and cognizant 
in september  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to rh donnelley corporation donnelley d b  and a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation d b the distribution 
during  cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated ims and nielsen media research  inc nmr the cognizant distribution 
in september  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to moody s corporation moody s and also referred to elsewhere in this annual report on form k as moody s d b  and a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation we or d b and also referred to elsewhere in this annual report on form k as d b the distribution 
tax matters moody s d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  principally through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
as further 
table of contents described below  we undertook contractual obligations to be financially responsible for a portion of certain liabilities arising from certain historical tax planning initiatives legacy tax matters 
as of the end of  settlement agreements have been executed with the irs with respect to the legacy tax matters previously referred to in our sec filings as utilization of capital losses and royalty expense deductions 
with respect to the utilization of capital losses matter  the settlement agreement resolved the matter in its entirety 
for the royalty expense deductions matter  the settlement covered tax years and  which represented approximately of the total potential liability to the irs  including penalties 
we believe we are adequately reserved for the remaining exposure 
in addition  with respect to these two settlement agreements  we believe that ims and nmr did not pay their allocable share to the irs under applicable agreements 
under our agreement with donnelley d b  we and moody s were each required to cover the shortfall  and each of us paid to the irs approximately million in excess of our respective allocable shares 
if we are unable to resolve our dispute with ims and nmr through the negotiation process contemplated by our agreements  we will commence arbitration to enforce our rights and collect these amounts from ims and nmr 
we believe that the resolution of the remaining exposure to the irs under the royalty expense deduction matter and the foregoing disputes with ims and nmr will not have a material adverse impact on d b s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our remaining legacy tax matter is referred to as amortization and royalty expense deductions royalty income 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we received a series of notices with respect to a partnership agreement entered into in in these notices the irs asserted  among other things  that certain amortization expense deductions claimed by donnelley d b  moody s d b and d b on applicable tax returns for years should be disallowed 
in addition to the foregoing  the irs has asserted that royalty expense deductions claimed for for royalties paid to the partnership should be disallowed 
we have filed protests with the irs with respect to these notices 
the irs has also asserted that the receipt of these same royalties by the partnership should be reallocated to and reported as royalty income by the taxpayers  including the portions of the royalties that were allocated to third party partners in the partnership  and thus included in their taxable income 
we believe that the irs positions with respect to the treatment of the royalty expense and royalty income are mutually inconsistent 
if the irs prevails on one of the positions  we believe that it is unlikely that it will prevail on the other 
in addition to the foregoing  the irs has asserted that certain business expenses incurred by moody s d b and d b during should be capitalized and amortized over a year period  if but only if the proposed adjustments described above are not sustained 
we estimate that the net impact to cash flow as a result of the disallowance of the amortization expense deductions and the disallowance of such deductions claimed from to date could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of tax benefits but not taking into account the moody s d b repayment to us of million described below 
this transaction is scheduled to expire in and  unless terminated by us  the net impact to cash flow  based on current interest rates and tax rates would increase at a rate of approximately million per quarter including potential penalties as future amortization expenses are deducted 
we anticipate making a deposit to the irs of approximately million in the first quarter of in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to tax years this deposit would not impact our free cash flow and will be a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also estimate that  with regard to the possible disallowance of deductions for royalty expenses paid to the partnership and the reallocation of royalty income from the partnership  after taking into account certain other tax benefits resulting from the irs position on the partnership  it is unlikely that there will be any net impact to cash flow in addition to the amounts noted above related to the amortization expense deduction disallowance 
in the unlikely event the irs were to prevail on both positions with respect to the royalty expense and royalty income  we estimate that the net impact to cash flow as a result of the disallowance of the royalty expense deductions  and the inclusion of the reallocated royalty income for all relevant 
table of contents years  could be up to million tax  interest  and penalties  net of tax benefits 
this million would be in addition to the million noted above related to the amortization expense deduction 
at the time of the distribution  we paid moody s d b approximately million in cash representing the discounted value of future tax benefits associated with this transaction 
pursuant to the terms of the distribution  should the transaction be terminated  moody s d b would be required to repay us an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
if the transaction was terminated at december   the amount of such repayment from moody s d b to us would be approximately million and would decrease by approximately million to million per year 
we are attempting to resolve this matter with the irs before proceeding to litigation  if necessary 
if we  on behalf of donnelley d b  moody s d b  and d b were to challenge  at any time  any of these irs positions for years in us district court or the us court of federal claims  rather than in us tax court  the disputed amounts for each applicable year would need to be paid in advance for the court to have jurisdiction over the case 
we have considered the foregoing legacy tax matters and the merits of the legal defenses and the various contractual obligations in our overall assessment of potential tax liabilities 
as of december   we have net million of reserves recorded in the consolidated financial statements  made up of the following components million in accrued income tax and million in other non current liabilities 
we believe that these reserves are adequate for our share of the liabilities in these legacy tax matters 
any payments that would be made for these exposures could be significant to our cash from operations in the period a cash payment took place  including any payments for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction in us district court or the us court of federal claims to challenge any of the irs s positions 
information resources  inc on or about february   this antitrust lawsuit was settled and mutual releases were signed by the parties 
the dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the mutual releases are being held in escrow pending dismissal of the lawsuit 
as more fully explained below  we were fully indemnified for this matter and therefore did not contribute to the settlement payment 
under an amended joint defense agreement  vnu nv  a publicly traded dutch company and certain of its us subsidiaries collectively  the vnu parties  assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this lawsuit 
because of this indemnity obligation  d b did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the vnu parties defaulted on their obligations  which did not occur 
accordingly  the vnu parties paid the entire settlement amount of million 
by way of background  in  iri filed a complaint  subsequently amended in  in federal court in new york that named as defendants a company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation and now known as rh donnelley referred to in this annual report on form k as donnelley d b  ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant corporation 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a wholly owned subsidiary of donnelley d b the amended complaint alleged various violations of us antitrust laws 
iri sought damages in excess of million  which iri asked to be trebled  as well as punitive damages and attorneys fees 
as noted above  we did not contribute to the settlement payment and  therefore  the resolution of this matter did not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of this matter had been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
hoover s initial public offering litigation on november   a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against hoover s  certain of its then current and former officers and directors the individual defendants  and one of the investment banks that was an underwriter of hoover s july initial public offering ipo 
the lawsuit was filed in the 
table of contents united states district court for the southern district of new york and purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the stock of hoover s during the period from july  through december  a consolidated amended complaint  which is now the operative complaint  was filed on april  the purported class action alleges violations of sections and of the securities act of  as amended  the act and sections b  rule b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  against hoover s and the individual defendants 
plaintiffs allege that the underwriter defendant agreed to allocate stock in hoover s ipo to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at predetermined prices above the ipo price 
plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for hoover s ipo was false and misleading in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements 
the action seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
the defense of the action is being coordinated with more than other nearly identical actions filed against other companies 
on july   hoover s moved to dismiss all claims against it and the individual defendants 
on october   the court dismissed the individual defendants from the case based upon stipulations of dismissal filed by the plaintiffs and the individual defendants 
on february   the court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint against hoover s 
on october   the court certified a class in six of the approximately other nearly identical actions and noted that the decision is intended to provide strong guidance to all parties regarding class certification in the remaining cases 
plaintiffs have not yet moved to certify a class in the case involving hoover s 
hoover s has approved a settlement agreement and related agreements that set forth the terms of a settlement between hoover s  the plaintiff class and the vast majority of the other approximately issuer defendants 
among other provisions  the settlement provides for a release of hoover s and the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the action to be wrongful 
hoover s would agree to undertake certain responsibilities  including agreeing to assign away  not assert  or release certain potential claims hoover s may have against its underwriters 
the settlement agreement also provides a guaranteed recovery of billion to plaintiffs for the cases relating to all of the approximately issuers 
to the extent that the underwriter defendants settle all of the cases for at least billion  no payment will be required under the issuers settlement agreement 
to the extent that the underwriter defendants settle for less than billion  the issuers are required to make up the difference 
it is anticipated that any potential financial obligation of hoover s to plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement and related agreements will be covered by existing insurance 
hoover s currently is not aware of any material limitations on the expected recovery of any potential financial obligation to plaintiffs from its insurance carriers 
its carriers are solvent  and hoover s is not aware of any uncertainties as to the legal sufficiency of an insurance claim with respect to any recovery by plaintiffs 
therefore  we do not expect that the settlement will involve any payment by hoover s 
if material limitations on the expected recovery of any potential financial obligation to the plaintiffs from hoover s insurance carriers should arise  hoover s maximum financial obligation to plaintiffs pursuant to the settlement agreement is less than million 
on february   the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement  subject to certain modifications consistent with its opinion 
those modifications have been made 
there is no assurance that the court will grant final approval to the settlement 
a further hearing with regard to the settlement is scheduled for april  as previously noted  if the settlement is ultimately approved and implemented in its current form  hoover s reasonably foreseeable exposure in this matter  if any  would be limited to amounts that would be covered by existing insurance 
if the settlement is not approved in its current form  we cannot predict the final outcome of this matter or whether such outcome or ultimate resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of any potential judgment in this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
pension plan litigation march action in march  a lawsuit seeking class action status was filed against us in federal court in connecticut on behalf of specified former employees relating to our retirement plans 
as noted below  during the fourth 
table of contents quarter of  most of the counts in the complaint were dismissed 
the complaint  as amended in july the amended complaint  sets forth the following putative class current d b employees who are participants in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account and were previously participants in its predecessor plan  the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  current employees of receivable management services corporation rmsc who are participants in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account and were previously participants in its predecessor plan  the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  former employees of d b or d b s receivable management services rms operations who received a deferred vested retirement benefit under either the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account or the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  and former employees of d b s rms operations whose employment with d b terminated after the sale of the rms operations but who are not employees of rmsc and who  during their employment with d b  were eligible employees for purposes of the dun bradstreet career transition plan 
the amended complaint estimates that the proposed class covers over  individuals 
there are four counts in the amended complaint 
count claims that we violated erisa by not paying severance benefits to plaintiffs under our career transition plan 
count claims a violation of erisa in that our sale of the rms business to rmsc and the resulting termination of our employees constituted a prohibited discharge of the plaintiffs and or discrimination against the plaintiffs for the intentional purpose of interfering with their employment and or attainment of employee benefit rights which they might otherwise have attained 
count claims that the plaintiffs were materially harmed by our alleged violation of erisa s requirements that a summary plan description reasonably apprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plans and that  therefore  undisclosed plan provisions in this case  the actuarial deduction beneficiaries incur when they leave d b before age and elect to retire early cannot be enforced against them 
count claims that the interest rate the rate is actually used to actuarially reduce early retirement benefits is unreasonable and  therefore  results in a prohibited forfeiture of benefits under erisa 
in the amended complaint  the plaintiffs sought payment of severance benefits  equitable relief in the form of either reinstatement of employment with d b or restoration of employee benefits including stock options  invalidation of the actuarial reductions applied to deferred vested early retirement benefits  including invalidation of the plan rate of the actual rate is used to actuarially reduce former employees early retirement benefits  attorneys fees and such other relief as the court may deem just 
we deny all allegations of wrongdoing and are aggressively defending the case 
in september  we filed a motion to dismiss counts  and of the amended complaint on the ground that plaintiffs cannot prevail on those claims under any set of facts  and in february  the court heard oral argument on our motion 
with respect to count  the court requested that the parties conduct limited expert discovery and submit further briefing 
in november  after completion of expert discovery on count  we moved for summary judgment on count on the ground that an interest rate of is reasonable as a matter of law 
on november   the court issued a ruling granting our motion to dismiss counts and shortly after that ruling  plaintiffs counsel stipulated to dismiss with prejudice count which challenged the sale of the rms business as an intentional interference with employee benefit rights  but which the motion to dismiss did not address 
plaintiffs counsel also stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice of count  the severance pay claim  agreeing to forego any appeal of the court s dismissal of that claim 
plaintiffs counsel did file a motion to join party plaintiffs and to amend the amended complaint to add a new count challenging the adequacy of the retirement plan s mortality tables 
the court granted the motion and we filed our objections 
on june   the court granted d b s motion for summary judgment as to count the interest rate issue and also denied the plaintiffs motion to further amend the amended complaint to add a new claim challenging the mortality tables 
on july   the plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal  they are appealing the ruling granting the motion to dismiss  the ruling granting summary judgment  and the denial of leave to amend their amended complaint 
oral argument before the second circuit took place on february  a decision is expected within six weeks 

table of contents while we believe we have strong defenses in this matter  we are unable to predict at this time the final outcome of this matter or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
september action in addition to the foregoing proceeding  a lawsuit seeking class action status was filed in september of against us in federal court in the northern district of illinois on behalf of a current employee relating to our retirement plans 
the complaint the complaint seeks certification of the following putative class current or former d b employees other than employees who on december  i were at least age with years of vesting service  ii had attained an age which  when added to his or her years of vesting service  was equal to or greater than  or iii had attained age  who participated in the dun bradstreet master retirement plan before january  and who have participated in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account at any time since january  the complaint estimates that the proposed class covers over  individuals 
there are five counts in the complaint 
count claims that we violated erisa by reducing the rate of an employee s benefit accrual on the basis of age 
count claims a violation of erisa s non forfeitability requirement  because the plan allegedly conditions receipt of cash balance benefits on foregoing the early retirement benefits plaintiff earned prior to the adoption of the cash balance amendment 
count claims that the cash balance plan violates erisa s anti backloading rule 
count claims that d b failed to supply advance notice of a significant benefit decrease 
count claims that d b failed to provide an adequate summary plan description 
in the complaint  the plaintiff seeks a declaration that a d b s cash balance plan is ineffective and that the d b master retirement plan is still in force and effect  and b plaintiff s benefit accrual under the cash balance plan must be unconditional and not reduced because of age  an injunction a prohibiting the application of the cash balance plan s reduction in the rate of benefit accruals because of age and its conditions of benefits due under the plan  and b ordering appropriate equitable relief to determine plan participant losses caused by d b s payment of benefits under the cash balance plan s terms and requiring the payment of additional benefits as appropriate  attorneys fees and costs  interest  and such other relief as the court may deem just 
a motion to transfer venue to the district of new jersey was filed on january  a decision is expected by the end of march we believe we have strong defenses in this matter and we will deny all allegations of wrongdoing and aggressively defend the case 
we are unable to predict at this time the final outcome of this matter or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
other in addition  in the normal course of business  d b indemnifies other parties  including customers  lessors and parties to other transactions with d b  with respect to certain matters 
d b has agreed to hold the other parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants  or arising out of other claims made against certain parties 
these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 
d b has also entered into indemnity obligations with its officers and directors of the company 
additionally  in certain circumstances  d b issues guarantee letters on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiaries for specific situations 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by d b under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business for internal management purposes  we refer to core revenue which we calculate as total revenue less the revenue of divested businesses 
core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our business segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in a single performance measure 
core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue 
divested business revenue for the three years of results included in this annual report on form k includes the revenue from our operations in israel sold in the third quarter of  the nordic region sweden  denmark  norway and finland  all sold in the first quarter of  india and other distribution channels in pakistan and the middle east sold in the first quarter of  central europe germany  austria  switzerland  poland  hungary and the czech republic  all sold in the second quarter of  iberia spain and portugal  both sold in the fourth quarter of  and france sold in the fourth quarter of 
these divested businesses have been classified as divestitures in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes that this measure provides valuable insight into our revenue from ongoing operations and enables investors to evaluate business performance and trends by facilitating a comparison of results of ongoing operations with past reports of financial results 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
we further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
in addition  with respect to our italian real estate data business  we analyze core revenue both before and after the impact of price increases 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such 
table of contents charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
a recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges  which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as financial flexibility 
through financial flexibility  management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of quality  efficiency and cost  in order to generate savings primarily to invest for growth 
such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period 
management reviews operating results before such charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures 
management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries  target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on such measures and a significant percentage weight is placed upon such measures in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved 
management believes that by eliminating restructuring charges from such financial measures  and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges  business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders  rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for financial information regarding our segments 
similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value 
it should not be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
other components of how we manage our business are free cash flow and net debt position we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
we define net debt position as cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities minus short term debt and long term debt 
we believe net debt position to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating our liquidity on a global consolidated basis 
free cash flow and net debt position should not be considered as a substitute measure for net cash flows provided by operating activities  investing activities or financing activities  or cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  short term debt and long term debt  respectively 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow and net debt position as complements to our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
the adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and  as noted above  for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies

with each program we have incurred a restructuring charges which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  
table of contents contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations  less assumed sublease income and transition costs which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
our financial flexibility programs are continuing 
on january   our board of directors approved our financial flexibility program 
this program will create financial flexibility through initiatives including the following eliminating  standardizing  and consolidating redundant technology platforms  software licenses and maintenance agreements  standardizing and consolidating customer service teams and processes to increase productivity and capacity utilization  consolidating our vendors to improve purchasing power  and improving operating efficiencies of facilities 
we expect to complete all actions under the program by december on an annualized basis  these actions are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility  of which approximately million to million will be generated in  before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of spending 
to implement these initiatives  we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million 
in addition  we expect to incur non core charges  totaling million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance  approximately million to million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately million relate to other exit costs in approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures 
in addition  as a result of this re engineering program  we expect that approximately to positions will be eliminated globally 
our critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein  we have applied the significant accounting policies described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the actual results could have a material impact on such period 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we offer substantially all of our us based employees coverage in a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account the us qualified plan 
the defined benefit plan covers active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of spin off companies 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states the us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for 
table of contents approximately and of our pension obligations  respectively  at december  our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees who retire with years of vesting service after age are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  our pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
other postretirement benefits ie  health care are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by our outside actuaries 
the key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement costs are  expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on current and expected asset allocations as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments  discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
the discount rates are derived by using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with an applicable yield curve developed from high quality bond portfolios  rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators  and health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will lower this assumption to from in and from in the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
we expect this one quarter percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return will reduce our annual operating income by approximately million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually  based on the factors noted above 
for example  as of december   for all of our us pension plans  we lowered the discount rate to from used at december  we expect that this one quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate applied with respect to the us qualified and non qualified plans will reduce our annual operating income by approximately million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
as of december   we increased the discount rate for our postretirement benefit plan to from used at december  the discount rate has a minimal effect on the postretirement cost and  therefore  we do not expect this five basis point increase in the discount rate to have a significant impact on our annual operating income 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in sfas no 
the purpose of the corridor is to average 
table of contents the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total unrecognized actuarial losses as of december  and were million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was attributable to the us qualified plan  million and million  respectively  was attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
also see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to recognize such losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million  million and million  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and non us plans  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the increased amortization of actuarial loss of million related to the us qualified plan  which will be included in our pension cost in  is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding the corridor threshold under sfas no 
at january  differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
we recorded net periodic cost for our pension plans of million for and net periodic pension income of million and million for the years and  respectively 
a major component of the net periodic pension cost is the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
in  and  we recorded investment gains of million  million and million  respectively  in our pension plans  of which million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan and million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the non us plans 
at january   the market related value of plan assets of our us qualified plan and the us plans was  million and million  respectively  which excludes million of unrecognized investment loss and million of unrecognized investment gain  respectively  from prior periods 
if the unrecognized losses are not recovered in future years  our market related value of assets will decrease  causing our expected return on plan assets to fall and our net periodic pension costs to rise 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in a significant future charge to our equity 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 if the plan asset value falls below the related accumulated benefit obligation  we would be required to record a minimum pension liability for the difference between the two amounts and reverse our prepaid pension cost 
this charge would be recorded against a component of shareholders equity  net of applicable deferred taxes 
we recognized charges of million  million and million  net of applicable taxes  to shareholders equity for minimum pension liabilities related to our us non qualified plans and us plans for  and  respectively 
the us qualified plan  our principal plan  is currently over funded 
the excess of the fair value of plan assets over the related accumulated benefit obligation was million at december   compared with million at december  the prepaid pension cost associated with this plan was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our pension plans by changing the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation 
for the us qualified plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
for the non qualified plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million

contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

we had a net pension cost of million for the year ended december  and net pension income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for all of our global pension plans 
the increase in pension cost or decrease in pension income from to was primarily due to increased actuarial loss amortizations included in annual expense as required by sfas no 
actuarial loss amortizations included in annual pension expense for all global plans were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million was attributable  respectively for such years  to our us plans 
the losses subject to amortization are primarily the result of asset losses from through  and the impact of lower discount rates 
additionally  a one quarter percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return assumption for our us qualified plan  and a three quarter percent decrease in the discount rate used to value our us plans also contributed to the increase in expense during the period

table of contents well as the impact of medicare reform act 
specifically  in the fourth quarter of  we amended our postretirement benefit plan and starting january   we began to limit the amount of our insurance premium contribution based on the amount we contributed in per retiree 
this change is expected to reduce our annual postretirement benefit costs by approximately million a year for five to six years  starting in the impact of the medicare reform act in the third quarter of also contributed to the decreased postretirement benefit cost 
postretirement benefit income was greater in than in primarily due to the savings from medicare reform for a full year as well as an actuarial gain from the plan valuation 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately million for the year ended december  the expected decrease in postretirement benefit income is primarily due to a portion of the negative unrecognized prior service cost recognized immediately in as a one time curtailment gain as a result of the and financial flexibility program 
the curtailment gain is included within restructuring charges 
we consider net pension income and postretirement benefit costs to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs

sales marketing solutions a million  or  increase in sales marketing solutions 
for the year ended december   value added solutions revenue  which accounted for of total us sales marketing solutions  increased 
there were two main drivers of this growth double digit growth in our customer information management cim solutions  and our planned migration of our customers from our traditional solutions to our more automated value added solutions 
for the year ended december   our value added sales marketing solutions growth was partially offset by the decrease in traditional sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of total us sales marketing solutions 
the decline was primarily attributed to continued weakness in certain of our traditional list and label businesses 
e business solutions a million  or  increase in e business solutions  representing the results of hoover s  inc the increase was primarily due to continued growth in subscription revenue and the benefit of our marketing efforts  which have driven increased traffic to the hoover s web site and strong ad sales

year ended december  international overview international total revenue decreased million  or decrease before the effect of foreign exchange  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decline is primarily a result of our having divested certain businesses  which for the year ended december   accounted for million of revenue  and a decrease in revenues from our united kingdom uk market  partially offset by our italian real estate data business  which contributed six percentage points of revenue growth  mainly due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in ribes spa  a leading provider of business information to italian banks  and an aggregate increase in revenue from our other international markets

this growth was attributable primarily to our italian real estate data business  which contributed eight percentage points of such growth  mainly due to a price increase and the acquisition of a controlling interest in ribes spa  and an increase in revenue in our other international markets  primarily resulting from increased product usage by existing customers  partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the uk resulting primarily from the continued impact of lower customer product usage due to our insufficient focus on customer renewals in late and the first quarter of in the second half of  we introduced a subscription plan in our european markets  leveraging our success in rolling out a similar program in the us this new plan provides our customers unlimited use  within pre defined ranges  of our risk management reports and data  provided such customers commit to an increased level of spend from their historical levels 
we believe that the subscription plan will be an important contribution to our revenue growth in future years

sales marketing solutions a million  or  decrease in sales marketing solutions decrease before the effect of foreign exchange

such decrease was primarily attributed to lower revenues in the uk  resulting from a highly competitive marketplace 
for the year ended december   our value added sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of our total international sales marketing solutions  increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
this was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases by customers utilizing our new value added solutions and revenue from our international partners 
e business solutions international revenue also benefited from million of revenue from e business solutions 
we first began offering our hoover s solution to customers in europe in the fourth quarter of supply management solutions a million  or decrease in supply management solutions decrease before the effect of foreign exchange 
international operating income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decline in revenue in the uk  the loss of income from our divested businesses  and increased expenses related to the investigation and final resolution of a dispute arising out of the sale of our french business  
table of contents partially offset by the benefits of our reengineering efforts  and an increase in revenue from other international markets 
the following factors affecting international create particular challenges to our international business our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets 
this reduces the demand for our risk management solutions  in certain local markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customers need to purchase our data  and governmental agencies  which may seek  from time to time  to increase the fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data 
for example in february  regulations implementing new tax legislation became effective in italy that significantly increased data acquisition costs for our italian real estate data business and required that we pay a fee each time we resell that data 
in response to this  we instituted a combination of price increases to our customers and reengineering efforts 
as a result  both our revenue and our operating costs increased  without a material impact to our operating income 
we believe that aspects of the regulations are illegal and  therefore  are challenging them in court and with anti trust authorities 
we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts 
similar to its actions at the end of  which led to the february regulations set forth above  the italian government is considering legislation that could seek to increase the data acquisition costs and re use fees for other public data that we currently use to support our italian risk management solutions business 
at this time we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or its final form or the impact of any such legislation on our results of operations 
we continue to monitor our italian operations and we are continuing to consider our strategic alternatives with respect to this business 
as we continue to implement our international market leadership strategy  we will continue to use different approaches to improve our competitive position from market to market worldwide 
in some markets  we are investing to strengthen our position  either through organic growth or by acquisition 
in other markets  we have established strategic relationships to strengthen our global data coverage and our customer value propositions 
additionally  we will continue to leverage our dunsright quality process to establish leadership positions in our international markets 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  international overview international total revenue decreased million  or decrease before the effect of foreign exchange  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of our having divested certain businesses  which  for the two years ended december  and  accounted for million and million of revenue  respectively  partially offset by the success of our monitoring solution  e portfolio  and the impact of having a full year of revenue from our acquisitions of italian real estate data companies  which contributed two percentage points of growth in

for the year ended december   traditional risk management solutions  which accounted for of total international risk management solutions  increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
the two main drivers of this growth were the success of our monitoring solution  e portfolio  and the full year benefit from our acquisition of the italian real estate data companies  which contributed two percentage points of the growth in traditional risk management solutions 
for the year ended december   our value added risk management solutions  which accounted for of total international risk management solutions  increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
this increase was driven by our customers preference to continue to automate their decisioning processes through solutions such as global decision maker tm  and to integrate existing systems using our toolkit solutions

for the year ended december   traditional sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of our total international sales marketing solutions  increased decrease before the effect of foreign exchange  reflecting the highly competitive local marketplace for traditional solutions 
for the year ended december   our value added sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of our total international sales marketing solutions  decreased decrease before the effect of foreign exchange 
such decrease was primarily attributed to our need to enhance our value propositions for our customers by offering the same value added solutions that have been successfully leveraged in our us segment  and our focus on migrating our customers to value added solutions from traditional solutions 
e business solutions million of revenue from e business solutions 
we first began offering our hoover s solution to customers in europe in the fourth quarter of supply management solutions a million  or  decrease in supply management solutions decrease before the effect of foreign exchange 
international operating income increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the increase in core revenue  reduced operating expenses as a result of divested businesses  
table of contents the benefits of our reengineering initiatives  and the positive effect of foreign exchange 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions and  from time to time  we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes  as discussed under interest rate risk  below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and financial position and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to achieve our policy objectives  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
in  we issued million in principal of five year  fixed rate notes that mature in march see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in connection with that note issuance  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with notional principal amounts totaling million see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term  fixed rate notes 
the arrangement is considered a highly effective hedge and therefore  the accounting for these hedges has no impact on earnings 
the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
during september  we entered into an interest rate derivative transaction with the objective of hedging a portion of the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in the anticipation of a future debt issuance during the first half of this transaction was accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
as such  changes in fair value of the swap that take place through the date of debt issuance are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   the derivative transaction had a mark to market value of million recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
foreign exchange risk we have offices in countries outside the us and conduct operations through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local players in more than additional countries 
our international operations generated approximately and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our assets  as of december  and  respectively  were located outside the us  and no country outside the us  other than the uk  had a significant concentration of our aggregate cash balances 

table of contents our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
in addition  we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and investments 
we use short term foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling and the euro 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet position hedges are recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated financial statements and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with net investment hedges are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in our consolidated financial statements 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  from time to time we use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
as of december  and  there were no option contracts outstanding 
the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter  and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  we had a notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively  of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated intercompany loans 
gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  in addition  at december  we had million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding associated with our international investments 
losses associated with these contracts were million at december  these contracts typically have various expiration dates within three months of entry into such contracts 
if exchange rates on average were to increase from year end levels  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from year end levels  the unrealized gain would be approximately million 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be offset substantially by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
subsequent to the completion of our million foreign cash repatriation in the fourth quarter of  we had a notional amount of approximately million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  with net unrealized gain of million 
if exchange rates on average were to increase from those levels  the unrealized loss would be approximately million 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from those levels  the unrealized gain would be approximately million 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be offset substantially by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
liquidity and financial position in accordance with our blueprint for growth strategy  we have used our cash for three primary purposes investments in the current business  acquisitions  as appropriate  and our share repurchase programs 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements  are sufficient to meet our short term and long term needs  including the cash cost of our restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations and contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  excluding the legal matters identified therein for which the exposures are not estimable 
in addition  our million debt obligation under our fixed rate notes is repayable in march  and we believe that we will refinance such

as such  changes in fair value of the swap that take place through the date of debt issuance are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   the derivative had a fair value of approximately million 
most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities  which are under operating leases that expire over the next years  with the majority expiring within five years 
we also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years 
these computer and other equipment leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as the lease terms expire and as advancements in computer technology present opportunities to lower costs and improve performance

pension and other postretirement benefits payments contributions represents projected contributions to our non us defined benefit plans as well as projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans  including the us non qualified plans and our postretirement benefit plan 
we do not expect to make any contributions to our us qualified plan 
the expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service 
a closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments  assuming that only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for up to approximately years 
as part of our spin off from moody s d b in  moody s and us entered into a tax allocation agreement dated as of september  the taa 
under the taa  moody s d b and d b agreed that moody s d b would be entitled to deduct compensation expense associated with the exercise of moody s d b stock options including moody s d b options exercised by d b employees and we would be entitled to deduct the compensation expense associated with the exercise of d b stock options including d b options exercised by employees of moody s d b 
in other words  the tax deduction goes to the company that issued the stock options 
the taa provides  however  that if the irs issues rules  regulations or other authority contrary to the agreed upon treatment of the tax deductions thereunder  then the party that becomes entitled under such new guidance to take the deduction may be required to reimburse the tax benefit it has realized  in order to indemnify the other party for its loss of such deduction 
the irs issued rulings discussing an employer s entitlement to stock option deductions after a spin off or liquidation that appear to require that the tax deduction belongs to the employer of the optionee and not the issuer of the option 
accordingly  under the taa  we received the benefit of additional tax deductions and under the taa we may be required to reimburse moody s d b for the loss of income tax deductions relating to to of approximately million in the aggregate for such years 
this potential reimbursement is a reduction to shareholders equity and has no impact on eps 
capital structure every year we examine our capital structure and review our plans 
for  we have made decisions to target returning all excess cash to shareholders  and maintaining our current debt rating 

table of contents in the past  we had chosen to keep excess cash on our balance sheet so it would be available to us as we worked through our legacy matters 
given that we have significantly reduced our exposure to these matters and have visibility into our cash requirements for  we are comfortable with the position of no excess cash on hand 
in addition  we have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs  acquisitions and share repurchases  if needed 
such borrowings would be supported by our bank credit facilities 
the lower cash position will decrease our interest income in share repurchases and dividends on january   our board of directors approved the addition of million to our existing million two year special share repurchase program  of which million was repurchased during the year ended december  the program is to be completed by the end of fiscal year and we plan to buy a total of million under our special share repurchase program in this amount is in addition to the existing repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under our stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   we repurchased  shares associated with this two year special share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of million 
in addition  we continued to repurchase shares  subject to market conditions  to offset the dilutive effect of the shares issued under our stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of stock for million 
partially offsetting the cash used for repurchase is million of net proceeds from employees related to the stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan 
in  we expect to see a significant increase in share repurchases to offset dilution from our equity plans 
we did not pay any dividends on our common stock during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we do not currently have plans to pay dividends to shareholders in potential payments in tax and legal matters we and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are at various stages of resolution  but could ultimately result in significant cash payments as described in item legal proceedings 
we believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters 
financial flexibility program on january   our board of directors approved our financial flexibility program 
through this program  we will create financial flexibility through a number of initiatives in  including eliminating  standardizing  and consolidating redundant technology platforms  software licenses and maintenance agreements  standardizing and consolidating customer service teams and processes to increase productivity and capacity utilization  consolidating our vendors to improve purchasing power  and improving operating efficiencies of facilities 
we expect to complete all actions under the program by december on an annualized basis  these actions are expected to create million to million of financial flexibility  of which approximately million to million will be generated in  before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of spending 
to implement these initiatives  we expect to incur transition costs of approximately million 
in addition  we expect to incur non core charges totaling million to million pre tax  of which million to million relate to severance  approximately million to million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately million relate to other exit costs in 
table of contents approximately million to million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures

pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements for financial statement reporting purposes  the funded status of our pension plans  as determined in accordance with gaap  was a surplus of million for the us qualified plan  a deficit of million for the us non qualified plans  and a deficit of million for the non us plans at december   as compared to a surplus of million  a deficit of million  and a deficit of million  respectively for such plans  at december  the reduction in funded status of the us plans was due primarily to the higher projected benefit obligation at december  driven by a lower discount rate and other assumption changes and experience loss during the year  partially offset by the gains in the plans equity investments 
this is detailed further in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
for funding purposes  as governed by the internal revenue service regulations  we are not required to contribute to the us qualified plan  the largest of our plans in  as the plan is considered fully funded under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
if the us qualified plan asset returns are flat and the assets decline by the amount of benefits paid to plan participants  and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same  we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until if plan assets appreciate between now and  the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond if plan assets depreciate  we could be required to make contributions sooner than in addition  if the us congress renews the pension funding equity act  we could delay contributions beyond  assuming there is no return on plan assets 
this act includes a provision governing the current liability interest rate to be used beginning in for calculating the additional funding requirement under the internal revenue code 
however  the act provides only two years of relief 
currently there are two pension reform bills in congress that have been passed separately in the house and in the senate 
if either of these is passed into law  a contribution to the retirement account could be due sooner than whether or not contributions are required  we may voluntarily make contributions to this plan sooner than  if allowable under internal revenue code funding provisions 
we expect to continue to make cash contributions to our other pension plans for the year ended december  the expected contribution is approximately million  compared to million in in addition  we expect to make benefit payments related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december see the table of contractual cash obligations above for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions we do not have any transactions  obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements
