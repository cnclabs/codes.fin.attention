overview our business we are a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures  markets and sells branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
we seek to capitalize on opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry through the development  including through in licensing arrangements and acquisitions  of novel branded prescription pharmaceutical products in attractive markets and the strategic acquisition of branded products that can benefit from focused promotion and marketing and product life cycle management 
under our corporate strategy we work to achieve organic growth by maximizing the potential of our currently marketed products and prudent product life cycle management 
we also work to achieve organic growth by continuing to develop investigational drugs that are in our pipeline 
our strategy also focuses on growth through the acquisition of novel branded pharmaceutical products in later stages of development and technologies that have significant market potential that complement our three key therapeutic areas of focus 
utilizing our internal resources and a disciplined business development process  we strive to be a leader and partner of choice in bringing innovative  clinically differentiated therapies and technologies to market in our key therapeutic areas 
we may also seek company acquisitions which add products or products in development  technologies or sales and marketing capabilities to our key therapeutic areas or that otherwise complement our operations 

table of contents our business consists of five segments which include branded pharmaceuticals  meridian medical technologies  royalties  contract manufacturing  and other 
in accordance with our strategy  our branded pharmaceutical products can be divided into the following therapeutic areas cardiovascular metabolic including altace and levoxyl  neuroscience including sonata and skelaxin  hospital acute care including thrombin jmi  and other 
we believe each of our key therapeutic areas of focus has significant market potential and our organization is aligned accordingly 
our meridian medical technologies segment consists of our auto injector business  which includes epipen and nerve gas antidotes which we provide to the us military 
royalties relates to revenues we derive from successfully developed products that we have licensed to third parties 
our contract manufacturing segment manufactures pharmaceutical products for third parties under contracts with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
highlights introduction during  we achieved many important accomplishments that we believe will better position us for long term growth 
among our many accomplishments  we believe we normalized the level of wholesale inventories of our branded pharmaceutical products  entered into definitive settlement agreements to resolve the governmental inquiries related to our underpayments of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to  enhanced the strength of our executive management team  and strengthened our research and development pipeline with the addition of remoxy tm and up to three additional opioid products  and the continued development of pt and other investigational drugs in our pipeline 
we believe these accomplishments position us to continue executing our strategy for long term growth in wholesale inventory reductions during late  we became aware of the need to improve our visibility with respect to wholesale inventory levels of our branded pharmaceutical products 
as a result  in april we successfully entered into inventory management agreements imas with each of our three key wholesale customers covering all of our branded products for the purpose of obtaining data regarding and reducing the level of wholesale inventories of our products 
as we anticipated  entering into the imas adversely affected net sales of some of our branded pharmaceutical products  particularly during  as wholesale inventory levels of these products were aggressively reduced 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended our imas with our key wholesale customers with the objective of further reducing their inventory of our products 
as a result  the average wholesale inventory level of our key products was further reduced during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this process was substantially complete for our key products by the end of the first quarter of wholesale inventory data provided by our customers indicates that wholesale inventory levels of our key branded products  altace  skelaxin  thrombin jmi  sonata and levoxyl  were each at one month or less of estimated end user demand as of december  the data on which we based our original third quarter estimate of wholesale inventory levels was incorrect primarily due to reporting errors by some of our customers 
accordingly  we now believe that the wholesale inventory levels of altace and 
table of contents skelaxin  as of the end of the third quarter of  were slightly higher than one month of end user demand 
we estimate that the wholesale and retail inventories of our products as of december  represents gross sales of approximately million to million 
settlement of governmental pricing investigation on october   we entered into definitive settlement agreements with the united states of america and with states and the district of columbia to resolve the governmental investigations related to the underpayment of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to we have agreed to a settlement with the remaining state on substantially the same terms as the other state settlements  and we expect to enter into a definitive settlement agreement with that state before the end of the first quarter of on march   we paid approximately million  comprising the settlement amount and accrued interest under our settlement agreements with the united states and the states and the district of columbia 
we have further agreed to pay approximately million to the remaining state and  subject to certain conditions  certain legal fees and settlement costs in the amount of approximately million 
we currently expect to pay these additional amounts by the end of the first quarter of in addition  we have entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services pursuant to which we are required  among other things  to keep in place our current compliance program  to provide periodic reports and to submit to audits relating to our medicaid rebate calculations 
consummation of the federal settlement agreement and some state settlement agreements is or was subject to court approval 
on february   the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania district court approved the federal settlement agreement 
all interested parties  including us  the individual purportedly acting as a relator under the false claims act and the affected states  have requested that the district court approve the state settlement agreements that require court approval 
the previously disclosed claim seeking damages from us because of alleged retaliatory actions against the relator was dismissed with prejudice on january  the settlement agreements described above will not resolve any of the previously disclosed civil suits that are pending against us and related individuals and entities discussed under the heading securities and erisa litigation in the section below entitled liquidity and capital resources 
also  the sec investigation of our previously disclosed errors relating to reserves for product returns is continuing 
for additional information and a discussion regarding the governmental investigations  please see settlement of governmental pricing investigation and sec investigation in the section below entitled liquidity and capital resources 
executive management team additions we continued to enhance our executive management team in with several notable additions  including joseph squicciarino  our new chief financial officer  who has over twenty years of financial experience in the pharmaceutical industry 
another important addition is eric j 
bruce  our new chief technical operations officer  who assumes responsibility for our manufacturing  logistics  distribution and quality organizations 
mr 
bruce has over years of manufacturing experience 
remoxy tm r d pipeline on november   we entered into a strategic alliance with pain therapeutics  inc to develop and commercialize remoxy tm and potentially up to three other abuse resistant opioid painkillers 
remoxy tm is an investigational drug in late stage clinical development by pain therapeutics for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain and represents the first of what is expected to be an entirely new class of proprietary drugs  abuse resistant opioid painkillers 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an up front payment of million in cash during the fourth quarter of pain therapeutics could also receive additional milestone payments of up to 
table of contents million in cash based on the successful clinical and regulatory development of remoxy tm and other abuse resistant opioid products 
this amount includes a million cash payment upon acceptance of a regulatory filing for remoxy tm and an additional million upon its approval 
we are responsible for all research and development expenses related to this alliance  which could total million 
we are also responsible for the payment of third party royalty obligations of pain therapeutics related to products developed under this collaboration 
remoxy tm  which is currently in phase iii clinical trials  is being developed as an abuse resistant version of long acting oxycodone  which is also known as oxycontin 
the remoxy tm formulation consists of a sticky  high viscosity mass that is not prone to injection or snorting 
it is intended to meet the needs of physicians who appropriately prescribe opioid painkillers and who seek to minimize risks of drug diversion  abuse or accidental patient misuse 
published data show that freezing  crushing  or submerging remoxy tm in high proof alcohol for hours at a time releases just a fraction of oxycodone compared to currently available formulations of oxycodone at time points when abusers presumably expect to be able to abuse its active ingredient 
with the addition of remoxy tm  our current research and development pipeline includes three products in phase iii and two products in late phase ii 
in addition to remoxy tm  our phase iii products include binodenoson  a pharmacologic cardiac stress imaging agent intended to provide a reduced side effects profile compared to the currently approved product adenoscan 
also in phase iii is vanquix tm  our diazepam filled auto injector that is currently under development as the only therapy of its kind for the treatment of acute  repetitive epileptic seizures 
our phase ii compounds are led by pt  under our collaborative agreement with palatin technologies 
pt is the first compound in a new drug class called melanocortin receptor agonists under development to treat sexual dysfunction in both men and women 
data obtained in trials  completed to date  indicates that pt is effective in male erectile dysfunction ed and provides additive benefit to pde inhibitors 
this new chemical entity is being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials studying the efficacy and safety profile of varying doses of this novel compound in men experiencing ed and women experiencing female sexual dysfunction 
also in phase ii is mre  an adenosine aa receptor agonist for the topical treatment of chronic  neuropathic  diabetic foot ulcers 
in the second half of  we also expect to begin the phase ii program for t  an adenosine a allosteric enhancer that we are developing for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
on december   we entered into a cross license agreement with mutual pharmaceutical company  inc under the terms of the agreement  each of the parties granted the other a worldwide license to certain intellectual property  including patent rights and know how  relating to metaxalone 
the intellectual property licensed to us relates to the potential for improved dosing and administration of metaxalone 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid mutual an upfront payment of million and will pay mutual royalties on net sales of products containing metaxalone beginning on january  our current formulation of metaxalone is skelaxin 
the royalty rate may increase depending on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones of metaxalone products 
on september   we entered into a strategic collaboration with inyx  inc relating to intal and tilade  which includes the continued development of a new formulation of intal utilizing hydrofluoroalkane hfa  an environmentally friendly propellant 
these products are our currently marketed inhaled anti inflammatory agents for the management of asthma 
pursuant to the agreements  we and inyx will co market intal and tilade and each have a share of net revenues 
we will continue to market to hospitals and primary care physicians  while inyx will pursue direct sales to the specialist markets 
inyx also plans to supervise the distribution of intal hfa in canada

table of contents our products 
while our calculation for returns reserves is based on historical sales and return rates over the period which customers have a right of return  we also consider the amount of wholesale inventory levels 
the significant reduction in wholesale inventories of our products during the first quarter of resulted in a decrease of approximately million in our reserve for returns and a corresponding increase in net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations 
in the second quarter of  an additional reduction in wholesale inventories resulted in a decrease of approximately million in our reserve for returns and a corresponding increase in net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations 
the current provision amounts in the table accrual for returns  above  have therefore been reduced by these amounts 
during the third quarter of  our actual returns of branded pharmaceutical products continued to decrease significantly on a quarterly basis compared to actual returns during the quarterly periods in and the first quarter of additionally  based on data received pursuant to our inventory management agreements with our key wholesale customers  we continued to experience normalized wholesale inventory levels of our branded pharmaceutical products during the third quarter of accordingly  we believe that the rate of returns experienced during the second and third quarters of is more indicative of what we should expect in future quarters and have adjusted our returns reserve accordingly 
this change in estimate resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the returns reserve in the third quarter and a corresponding increase in net sales from branded pharmaceutical products  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations 
the current provision amount in the accrual for returns above  has therefore been reduced by this amount 
as a result of this increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace in the third quarter of increased by approximately million 
the effect of the change in estimate on third quarter operating income was  therefore  approximately million 
as a result of our previously disclosed determination that we underpaid amounts due to medicaid and other government pricing programs from through  we developed a refined calculation to compute the average manufacturer s price amp and best price in compliance with federal laws and regulations 
for a discussion regarding the underpayment to medicaid and other government pricing programs from through  please see settlement of governmental pricing investigation in item  legal proceedings 
during the third quarter of  we began reporting to the centers for medicare and medicaid services using our refined calculation for computing amp and best price 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we recalculated rebates due with respect to prior quarters utilizing the refined amp and best price calculations 
as a result of this updated information  during the third quarter of  we decreased our reserve for estimated medicaid and other government pricing program obligations and increased net sales from branded pharmaceutical products by approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to this does not include the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations 
as a result of the increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace increased by approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to the effect of the change in estimate on operating income was  therefore  approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to

an intangible asset impairment charge in of million  which primarily related to our decision to discontinue the sonata mr development program  and a greater than expected 
table of contents decline in prescriptions for florinef and tapazole due to availability of generics for these products 
an intangible asset impairment charge of million in primarily reflecting the reduction in the fair value of the florinef intangible assets upon the fda s approval of a second generic on january  the additional intangible asset impairment charge pertaining to florinef recorded in reflects a further reduction in the fair value of the intangible assets associated with this product due to a decline in prescriptions that exceeded our original estimate 
these special items were recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the intangible assets on our balance sheet associated with these products so as to reflect the estimated fair value of these assets at the relevant time 
restructuring charges in the amount of million in due to a decision to reduce our workforce in order to improve efficiencies in our operations 
restructuring charges in the amount of million and million in and  respectively  primarily as a result of separation agreements with several of our executives  the relocation of our sales and marketing operations from bristol  tennessee to princeton  new jersey and our decision to discontinue some relatively insignificant products associated with meridian medical technologies business 
income of million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to a gain on our divestiture of our anusol hc and proctocort product lines and a gain on the termination of our co promotion and license agreements with novavax inc regarding estrasorb tm and the repurchase by novavax of all of its convertible notes which we held 
during  we had income of million due to a gain on the sale of our animal health products and certain non income producing intangible assets 
demand for some of our non key products  including but not limited to intal  tilade and synercid  declined over the past year at a rate which triggered a review of the intangible assets associated with these products 
as of december   the net intangible assets associated with these three products totaled approximately million 
we believe that these intangible assets are not currently impaired based on estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
however  if demand for the products associated with these intangible assets declines below current expectations  we may have to reduce the estimated remaining useful life and or write off a portion or all of these intangible assets

if a generic version of altace  skelaxin or sonata enters the market  we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with these products 
our rochester  michigan facility manufactures products for us and various third parties 
as of december   the net carrying value of the property  plant and equipment at the rochester facility  excluding that associated with the production of bicillin  was million 
overall production volume at this facility has been declining 
we are currently transferring to this facility the manufacture of certain products that are currently manufactured by us at other facilities or for us by third parties 
these transfers should increase production and cash flow at the rochester facility 
we currently believe that the long term assets associated with the rochester facility are not impaired based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  if production volumes continue to decline or if we are not successful in transferring additional production to the rochester facility  we may have to write off a portion of the property  plant  equipment associated with this facility

this supply agreement is reflected in the unconditional purchase obligations above 
this supply agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum levels of ramipril as long as we maintain market exclusivity on altace in the united states  and thereafter the parties must negotiate in good faith the annual minimum purchase quantities 
if sales of altace do not increase  if we are unable to maintain market exclusivity for altace in accordance with our current expectations  if our product life cycle management is not successful  or if the supply agreement or the annual minimum purchase commitments do not terminate at an optimal time for us  we may incur losses in connection with the purchase commitments under the supply agreement

elan was working to develop a modified release formulation of sonata  which we refer to as sonata mr  pursuant to an agreement we had with them which we refer to as the sonata mr development agreement 
in early  we advised elan that we considered the sonata mr development agreement terminated 
on august   elan filed a request for mediation pursuant to the terms of the sonata mr development agreement 
we participated in mediation with elan in early  which did not result in an agreed resolution

settlement of governmental pricing investigation on october   we entered into i a definitive settlement agreement with the united states of america  acting through the united states department of justice and the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania and on behalf of the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services hhs oig and the department of veterans affairs  to resolve the governmental investigations related to our underpayment of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to the federal settlement agreement  and ii similar settlement agreements with states and the district of columbia collectively  the state settlement agreements  and together with the federal settlement agreement  the settlement agreements 
we have agreed to a settlement with the remaining state on substantially the same terms as the other state settlements  and we currently expect to enter into a definitive settlement agreement with that state before the end of the first quarter of consummation of the federal settlement agreement and some state settlement agreements is or was subject to court approval 
on february   the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania district court approved the federal settlement agreement 
all interested parties  including king  the individual purportedly acting as a relator under the false claims act and the affected states  have requested that the district court approve the state settlement agreements that require court approval 
pursuant to the settlement agreements  we agreed to pay a total of approximately million the settlement amount and interest on the settlement amount at the rate of from july  to the date of consummation of the settlement 
we have further agreed to pay  subject to certain conditions  i legal fees relating to the settlement in the amount of approximately million  and ii approximately million in settlement costs 
the settlement amount includes approximately million of the settlement amount for payment to states and the district of columbia 
the settlement amount includes approximately million representing the amount of underpayments to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs from to and approximately million to cover interest  penalties and other costs 
we currently expect to pay the settlement amount and the other amounts described above 
on march   we paid approximately million  comprising the settlement amount and accrued interest under our settlement agreements with the united states and the states and the district of columbia 
we have agreed to pay approximately million to the remaining state 
we currently expect to make this payment and the other remaining payments by the end of the first quarter of certain decisions of the district court relating to the relator s dispute with certain states over a potential share award remain subject to appeal 
any share award would be paid solely by the government and would not affect the amount we are required to pay pursuant to the settlement 
consequently  we believe the reversal of any such decision or decisions would not have a material effect on us 
in addition to the settlement agreements  we have entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with hhs oig the corporate integrity agreement pursuant to which we are required  among other things  to keep in place our current compliance program  to provide periodic reports to hhs oig and to submit to audits relating to our medicaid rebate calculations 

table of contents we accrued in prior years a total of million in respect of our estimated underpayments to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs and estimated settlement costs with all relevant governmental parties  which sum is classified as restricted cash and an accrued expense on our balance sheet 
this sum is sufficient to cover the full cost of all sums owed the federal and state governments pursuant to the settlement agreements  together with related obligations to reimburse the expenses of some of the parties 
the previously disclosed claim seeking damages from us because of alleged retaliatory actions against the relator was dismissed with prejudice on january  the settlement agreements will not resolve any of the previously disclosed civil suits that are pending against us and related individuals and entities discussed in the section securities and erisa litigation below 
the foregoing description of the settlement  the settlement agreements and the corporate integrity agreement is qualified in its entirety by the company s current report on form k filed november   which is incorporated herein by reference 
sec investigation as previously reported  the sec has also been conducting an investigation relating to our underpayments to governmental programs  as well as into our previously disclosed errors relating to reserves for product returns 
while the sec s investigation is continuing with respect to the product returns issue  the staff of the sec has advised us that it has determined not to recommend enforcement action against us with respect to the aforementioned governmental pricing matter 
the staff of the sec notified king of this determination pursuant to the final paragraph of securities act release although the sec could still consider charges against individuals in connection with the governmental pricing matter  we do not believe that any governmental unit with authority to assert criminal charges is considering any charges of that kind 
we continue to cooperate with the sec s ongoing investigation 
based on all information currently available to us  we do not anticipate that the results of the sec s ongoing investigation will have a material adverse effect on king  including by virtue of any obligations to indemnify current or former officers and directors 
securities and erisa litigation subsequent to the announcement of the sec investigation described above  beginning in march  purported class action complaints were filed by holders of king s securities against the company  its directors  former directors  executive officers  former executive officers  king s subsidiary  and a former director of the subsidiary in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  alleging violations of the securities act of and or the securities exchange act of  in connection with our underpayment of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  and certain transactions between us and the benevolent fund 
these complaints have been consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee 
in addition  holders of king s securities filed two class action complaints alleging violations of the securities act of in tennessee state court 
king removed these two cases to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee  where these two cases were consolidated with the other class actions 
plaintiffs in these actions unsuccessfully moved to remand these two cases back to tennessee state court 
these two actions therefore remain part of the consolidated action 
the district court has appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action  and those lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on october  alleging that king  through some of its executive officers  former executive officers  directors  and former directors  made false or misleading statements concerning its business  financial condition  and results of operations during periods beginning february  and continuing until march  plaintiffs in the consolidated action have also named the underwriters of king s november public offering as 
table of contents defendants 
the company and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
on august   the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee ruled on defendants motions to dismiss 
the court dismissed all claims as to jones and as to defendants dennis jones and henry richards 
the court also dismissed certain claims as to five other individual defendants 
the court denied the motions to dismiss in all other respects 
following the court s ruling  on september   the company and the other remaining defendants filed answers to plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint 
discovery in this action has commenced 
the court has set a trial date of april  we have estimated a probable loss contingency for the class action lawsuit described above 
we believe this loss contingency will be paid on behalf of us by our insurance carriers 
accordingly  as of december   we have recorded a liability and a receivable for this amount  classified in accrued expenses and prepaid and other current assets  respectively  in our consolidated financial statement 
beginning in march  four purported shareholder derivative complaints were also filed in tennessee state court alleging a breach of fiduciary duty  among other things  by some of our current and former officers and directors  with respect to the same events at issue in the federal securities litigation described above 
these cases have been consolidated  and on october   plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint 
on november   defendants filed a motion to dismiss or stay the consolidated amended complaint 
the court denied the motion to dismiss  but granted a stay of proceedings 
on october   the court lifted the stay to permit plaintiffs to file a further amended complaint adding class action claims related to our then anticipated merger with mylan laboratories  inc on october   defendants filed a partial answer to the further amended complaint  and moved to dismiss the newly added claims 
following the termination of the mylan merger agreement  plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed these claims 
discovery with respect to the remaining claims in the case has commenced 
no trial date has been set 
beginning in march  three purported shareholder derivative complaints were likewise filed in tennessee federal court  asserting claims similar to those alleged in the state derivative litigation 
these cases have been consolidated  and on december  plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint 
on march   the court entered an order indefinitely staying these cases in favor of the state derivative action 
in august  a separate class action lawsuit was filed in tennessee state court  asserting claims solely with respect to our then anticipated merger with mylan laboratories 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case on november   which remains pending 
we believe that the claims in this case are moot following termination of the mylan merger agreement 
additionally  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee under the employee retirement income security act erisa 
as amended  the complaint alleges that king and certain of its executive officers  former executive officers  directors  former directors and an employee of king violated fiduciary duties that they allegedly owed king s k retirement savings plan s participants and beneficiaries under erisa 
the allegations underlying this action are similar in many respects to those in the class action litigation described above 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the erisa action on march  the district court judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation 
on december   the magistrate judge held a hearing on this motion  and  on december   he recommended that the district court judge dismiss the action 
the district court judge accepted the recommendation and dismissed the case on february  the plaintiffs have not appealed this decision  and the deadline for filing any appeal has now passed 
we are unable currently to predict the outcome or to reasonably estimate the range of potential loss  if any  except as noted above  in the pending litigation 
if we were not to prevail in the pending litigation  
table of contents or if any governmental sanctions are imposed in excess of those described above  neither of which we can predict or reasonably estimate at this time  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
responding to the government investigations and defending us in the pending litigation has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and the payment of additional professional fees

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities our cash flows from financing activities for all periods are primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options 
certain indebtedness and other matters as of december   we had outstanding million of convertible debentures due november  these debt securities were issued in a private placement in november holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of these debentures on november   november   and november  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest up to but not including the date of repurchase 
as of december   we have classified the debentures as a current liability due to the right the holders have to require us to repurchase the debentures on november  alternatively  we may elect to repurchase some or all of the debentures  by negotiation with debenture holders  a buy back program  or a tender offer  prior to 
table of contents november  the debentures accrue interest at an initial rate of which will be reset but not below or above on may  we also had available as of december  up to million under a five year senior secured revolving credit facility that we established in april the facility is collateralized in general by all of our real estate with a value of million or more and all of our personal property and that of our significant subsidiaries 
our obligations under the senior secured revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by most of our subsidiaries 
the senior secured revolving credit facility accrues interest at our option  at either a the base rate  which is based on the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus one half of  plus an applicable spread ranging from to based on a leverage ratio or b the applicable libor rate plus an applicable spread ranging from to based on a leverage ratio 
in addition  the lenders under the senior secured revolving credit facility are entitled to customary facility fees based on a unused commitments under the facility and b letters of credit outstanding 
we incurred million of deferred financing costs in connection with the establishment of this facility  which are being amortized over five years  the life of the senior secured revolving credit facility 
this facility requires us to maintain a minimum net worth of no less than billion plus of our consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter after april   excluding any fiscal quarter for which consolidated income is negative  an ebitda to interest expense ratio of no less than to  and a funded debt to ebitda ratio of no greater than to prior to april  and of no greater than to on or after april  as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
as of december   we had million outstanding for letters of credit under this facility 
on september   our universal shelf registration statement on form s was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
this universal shelf registration statement registered a total of billion of our securities for future offers and sales in one or more transactions and in any combination of debt and or equity 
during november  we completed the sale of  newly issued shares of common stock for per share per share net of commissions and expenses resulting in net proceeds of million 
as of december   there was million of securities remaining registered for future offers and sales under the shelf registration statement 
however  due to delays in our filings of one or more reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  we believe that we are not eligible to use a form s registration statement at the present time 
accordingly  unless and until we regain eligibility to use form s  we are not able to offer and sell securities under our shelf registration statement without first amending it to convert it to the registration statement form  form s  that is currently available to us 
whether or not we seek to raise funds in the public equity or debt markets in the near term  we may decide  or the sec may require us  to amend our shelf registration statement for the purpose of converting it to a form s impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
while we have passed some price increases along to our customers  we have primarily benefited from sales growth negating most inflationary pressures 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates for which it is reasonably possible that a material change in estimate could occur in the near term include forecasted future cash flows used in testing for impairments of intangible and 
table of contents tangible assets and loss accruals for excess inventory and fixed purchase commitments under our supply contracts 
forecasted future cash flows in particular require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
in the case of impairment testing  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a material impairment charge and  whether they result in an immediate impairment charge  could result prospectively in a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of tangible or intangible assets  which could be material to the financial statements 
other significant estimates include accruals for medicaid and other rebates  returns and chargebacks  allowances for doubtful accounts and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy and accounting for the co promotion agreement with wyeth 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from the related estimates  and our estimates may change from time to time in response to actual developments and new information 
the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results include the following intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights and trademarks  patents  acquired research and development  if any  and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
however  patents have specific legal lives over which they are amortized 
conversely  trademarks and product rights have no specific legal lives 
trademarks and product rights will continue to be an asset to us after the expiration of the patent  as their economic value is not tied exclusively to the patent 
we believe that by establishing separate lives for the patent versus the trademark and product rights  we are in essence using an accelerated method of amortization for the product as a whole 
this results in greater amortization in earlier years when the product is under patent protection  as we are amortizing both the patent and the trademark and product rights  and less amortization when the product faces potential generic competition  as the amortization on the patent is eliminated 
because we have no discernible evidence to show a decline in cash flows for trademarks and product rights  or for patents  we use the straight line method of amortization for both intangibles 
we review our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in any event  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
this evaluation is performed through our quarterly evaluation of intangibles for impairment 
further  on an annual basis  we review the life of each intangible asset and make adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future if prescriptions for  or sales of  our products are less than current expectations and result in a reduction of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
this may be caused by many factors  including competition from generic substitutes  significant delays in the manufacture or supply of materials  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials  new legislation or regulatory proposals

table of contents the remaining patent amortization period compared to the remaining amortization period for trademarks and product rights associated with significant products is as follows remaining life at december  trademark patent product rights altace years months years skelaxin years sonata year intal years inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate our entire inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we make a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed actual inventory quantities that we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 
accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for returns  chargebacks and medicaid and commercial rebates in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
at the time a rebate or chargeback payment is made or a product return is received  which occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of returns  chargebacks and rebates  the actual amount of product returns and claims for chargebacks and rebates may be different from our estimates 
our product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf life of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily on historical sales and return rates 
we also consider the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel 
we base our estimate of our medicaid rebate and commercial rebate accruals on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and the terms of our commercial and regulatory rebate obligations 
we base our estimate of our chargeback accrual on our estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
the estimate of the level of our products in the distribution channel is based on data provided by our three key wholesalers under inventory management agreements 
our accruals for returns  chargebacks and rebates are adjusted as appropriate for specific known developments that may result in a change in our product returns or our rebate and chargeback obligations 
in the case of product returns  we monitor demand levels for our products and the effects of the introduction of competing products and other factors on this demand 
when we identify decreases in demand for products or experience higher than historical rates of returns caused by unexpected discrete events  we further analyze these products for potential additional supplemental reserves
