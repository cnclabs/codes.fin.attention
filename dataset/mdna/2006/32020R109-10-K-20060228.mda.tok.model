item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as a multi bank financial holding company  we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments  trust fees  and service charges 
our primary source of funding for our loans and investments are deposits held by our subsidiary banks 
our largest expenses are interest on these deposits and salaries and related employee benefits 
we usually measure our performance by calculating our return on average assets  return on average equity  our regulatory leverage and risk based capital ratios  and our efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  and consolidated statements of earnings for the years through in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes  and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this form k 
average share information and earnings per share data related to our common stock have been adjusted to give effect to all stock splits and stock dividends  including the four for three stock split in the form of a stock dividend effective june  critical accounting policies we prepare consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies  generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry 
these policies  in certain areas  require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we deem a policy critical if the accounting estimate required us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our allowance for loan losses and its provision for loan losses  which we deem to be our most critical accounting policy 
we have other significant accounting policies and continue to evaluate the materiality of their impact on our consolidated financial statements  but we believe these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective  or it is less likely they would have a material impact on our reported results for a given period 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount we believe will be adequate to absorb inherent estimated losses on existing loans in which full collectibility is unlikely based upon our review and evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
our methodology is based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues and includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas  and allowance allocations determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have developed a consistent  well documented loan review methodology that includes allowances assigned to certain classified loans  allowances assigned based upon estimated loss factors and qualitative reserves 
the level of the allowance reflects our periodic evaluation of general economic conditions  the financial condition of our borrowers  the value and liquidity of collateral  delinquencies  prior loan loss experience  and the results of periodic reviews of the portfolio by our independent loan review department and regulatory examiners 
our allowance for loan losses is comprised of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with sfas based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with sfas that consider historical loss rates  loan classifications and other factors  and iii a qualitative reserve determined in accordance with sfas based upon general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company 
we regularly evaluate our allowance for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb estimated loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral  and general economic conditions 
all nonaccrual loans rated substandard or worse and greater than  are specifically reviewed and a specific allocation is assigned based on the losses expected to be realized from those loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  a certain portion of the loan portfolio is assigned a reserve allocation percentage 
the reserve allocation percentage is multiplied by the outstanding loan principal balance  less cash secured loans  government guaranteed loans and classified loans to calculate the required general reserve 
the general reserve allocation percentages assigned to groups of loans considers historical loss rates  loan classifications and other factors 
the qualitative reserves are determined by evaluating such things as current economic conditions and trends  changes in lending staff  policies or procedures  changes in credit concentrations  changes in the trends and severity of problem loans and changes in trends in volume and terms of loans 
the portion of the allowance that is not derived by the general reserve allocation percentages compensate for the uncertainty and complexity in estimating loan losses including factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination and application of the general reserve allocation percentages 
although we believe we use the best information available to make loan loss allowance determinations  future adjustments could be necessary if circumstances or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making our initial determinations 
a downturn in the economy and employment could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs  increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income 
additionally  as an integral part of their examination process  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the bank regulatory agencies could require the recognition of additions to the loan loss allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
our policy requires measurement of the allowance for an impaired collateral dependent loan based on the fair value of the collateral 
other loan impairments are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market price

lower ratios indicate better efficiency since more income is generated with a lower noninterest expense total 
our efficiency ratio for was compared to for  and for this increase in is primarily a result of our recent acquisitions of less efficient banks  resulting in increased operating and integration costs

the risk based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off balance sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories ranging from to 
regulatory capital is then divided by risk weighted assets to determine the risk adjusted capital ratios 
the leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangible assets by quarter to date average assets less intangible assets 
regulatory minimums for risk based and leverage ratios are and  respectively 
as of december   our total risk based and leverage ratios were and  respectively  as compared to total risk based and leverage ratios of and as of december  the decline in these ratios is due to the regulatory treatment for intangible assets from our clyde and bridgeport bank acquisitions in we believe by all measurements our capital ratios remain well above regulatory minimums 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
our exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through our strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
we use no off balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies  there is also a holding company wide committee that monitors the aggregate company s interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies 
each subsidiary bank tracks interest rate risk by  among other things  interest sensitivity gap and simulation analysis 
table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december   and sets forth the repricing dates of our consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as our projected consolidated interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
the table is based on our estimates and assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not  and cannot  necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on our consolidated net interest income 
should we be unable to maintain a reasonable balance of maturities and repricing of our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities  we could be required to dispose of our assets in an unfavorable manner or pay a higher than market rate to fund our activities 
our asset liability committees oversee and monitor this risk

we estimate that  as of december   an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a increase in projected net interest income over the next twelve months  and a downward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income over the next twelve months 
these are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
also  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
we believe these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude 
we also believe that it is unlikely that such changes would occur in a short time period 
as interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice in different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements  various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion 
since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions  we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates  and such differences could be material 
liquidity liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise 
such needs can develop from loan demand  deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities 
potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs 
many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position 
the potential need for liquidity arising from these types of financial instruments is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument  as detailed in tables and asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  federal funds sold  and short term investments in time deposits in banks 
liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources  which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to our subsidiary banks 
other sources of funds include our ability to borrow from short term sources  such as purchasing federal funds from correspondents and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase  which amounted to million at december   and an unfunded million line of credit established with a nonaffiliated bank which matures on december  on december   we renewed our loan agreement with the frost national bank  pursuant to which the company is permitted to draw up to million on a revolving line of credit 
interest is paid quarterly at libor plus basis points 
if a balance exists at december   the principal balance coverts to a term facility payable quarterly over five years 
the line of credit is unsecured for an outstanding balance up to million and secured by the stock of a subsidiary bank should the balance exceed million 
among other provisions in the credit agreement  we must satisfy certain financial covenants during the term of the loan agreement  including  without limitation  covenants that require us to maintain certain capital  tangible net worth  loan loss reserve  non performing asset and cash flow coverage ratios 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain operational covenants  that among others  restrict the payment of dividends above of consolidated net income  limit the incurrence of debt excluding any amounts acquired in an acquisition and prohibit the disposal of assets except in the ordinary course of business 
since  we have historically declared dividends as a percentage of our consolidated net income in a range of low in to high in there was no outstanding balance under the line of credit as of december  or on december   we borrowed million in connection with our acquisition of bridgeport financial corporation 
the amount was repaid in full on december  given the strong core deposit base and relatively low loan to deposit ratios maintained at our subsidiary banks  we consider our current liquidity position to be adequate to meet our short and long term liquidity needs 
in addition  we anticipate that any future acquisition of financial institutions and expansion of branch locations could also place a demand on our cash resources 
available cash at our parent company  which totaled million at december   available dividends from subsidiary banks which totaled million at december   utilization of available lines of credit  and future debt or equity offerings are expected to be the source of funding for these potential acquisitions or expansions

off balance sheet arrangements 
we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include unfunded lines of credit  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for unfunded lines of credit  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments 
we generally use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
unfunded lines of credit and commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  as we deem necessary upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the average collateral value held on letters of credit usually exceeds the contract amount 
table commitments as of december  in thousands total notional less than over amounts committed year years years years unfunded lines of credit     unfunded commitments to extend credit 
     standby letters of credit    total commercial commitments      we believe we have no other off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose entities that would expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
parent company funding 
our ability to fund various operating expenses  dividends  and cash acquisitions is generally dependent solely on our own earnings without giving effect to our subsidiaries  cash reserves and funds derived from our subsidiary banks 
these funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses 
we anticipate that our recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from our subsidiary banks 
at december   approximately million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by the subsidiary banks without the prior approval of regulatory agencies 
our subsidiary banks paid aggregate dividends of million in and million in dividends 
our long term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to our shareholders of between and of net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth 
the cash dividend payout ratios have amounted to  and of net earnings  respectively  in  and given our current strong capital position and projected earnings and asset growth rates  we do not anticipate any significant change in our current dividend policy 
also see payments of dividends on page each state bank that is a member of the federal reserve system and each national banking association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the occ  respectively  to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of such bank s net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus its retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two calendar years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation 
to pay dividends  we and our subsidiary banks must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines 
in addition  if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the bank  could include the payment of dividends  the authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice 
the federal reserve board and the occ have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings
