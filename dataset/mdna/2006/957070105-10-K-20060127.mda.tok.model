markets the company provides temporary staffing services primarily in secondary markets  as well as in the downtown areas of certain primary markets in the united states and selected international markets 
the company capitalizes on its presence in secondary markets and to build market share by targeting small to medium sized customers  including divisions of fortune companies 
the company believes that in many cases  such markets are less competitive and less costly to operate in than in the more central areas of primary markets  where a large number of staffing services companies frequently compete for business and occupancy costs are relatively high 
in addition  the company believes that secondary markets are more likely to provide the opportunity to sell retail and recurring business that is characterized by relatively higher gross margins 
the company augments this concentration on secondary markets by also focusing on national contracts with customers having a large presence in these marketplaces 
such accounts include large clients in multiple locations supported by a dedicated corporate level business relationship manager 
the company currently has existing national accounts across many different business sectors such as manufacturing  government  financial services  technology and communications 
the company maintains a professional sales team that services and leverages existing relationships to retain and grow these accounts

the company uses comprehensive methods to identify  assess  select and  when appropriate  measure the skills of its temporary employees to meet the needs of its customers 
the company believes one of its key competitive advantages in attracting and retaining temporary light industrial and clerical administrative staffing personnel is its payroll system  which provides it with the ability to print payroll checks at virtually all of its branch offices within hours after receipt of a timecard 
most company owned offices offer temporary employees a benefit package  including a service bonus and holiday pay

all eligible temporary employees have the option to participate in the company s k plan and discounted employee stock purchase plan 
operations the company operates each company owned office as a separate profit center and provides managers considerable operational autonomy and financial incentives 
the company also operates franchise agent offices in appropriate markets 
managers focus on business opportunities within markets and are provided centralized support to achieve success in those markets 
the company believes that this structure allows it to recruit and retain highly motivated managers who have demonstrated the ability to succeed in a competitive environment 
this structure also allows managers and staff to focus on market development while relying on centralized services for support in back office operations  such as risk management programs and unemployment insurance  credit  collections  accounting  advice on legal and regulatory matters  quality standards and marketing

one or more of these plans may be offered to branch staff as well as market and district managers and regional vice presidents 
these plans are designed to motivate employees to maximize the growth and profitability of their office  district or region  as well as to achieve budgeted goals 
the company believes that its incentive based compensation plans encourage employees in its company owned offices to increase sales and profits  resulting in a creative and committed team 
franchise agent offices 
the company s franchise agents have the exclusive right by contract to sell certain of the company s services and to use the company s service marks  business names and systems in a specified geographic territory 
the company s franchise agent agreements generally allow franchise agents to open multiple offices within their exclusive territories 
as of october   the company s franchise agents operated franchise agent offices 
sales generated by franchise agent operations and related costs are included in the company s consolidated revenue and costs of services  respectively  and during fiscal   and franchise agent sales represented   and respectively  of the company s revenue 
the franchise agent  as an independent contractor  is responsible for establishing and maintaining an office and paying related administrative and operating expenses  such as rent  utilities and salaries of its branch office staff 
each franchise agent functions as a limited agent of the company in recruiting job applicants  soliciting job orders  filling those orders and assisting and cooperating with collection matters upon request  but otherwise functions as an independent contractor 
as franchisor  the company is the employer of the temporary employees and the owner of the customer accounts receivable and is responsible for paying the wages of the temporary employees and all related payroll taxes and insurance 
as a result  the company provides a substantial portion of the working capital needed for the franchise agent operations 
franchise agents are required to follow the company s operating procedures and standards in recruiting  screening  classifying and retaining temporary personnel 
licensed offices 
as of october   one licensee operated one licensed office 
the company is no longer offering the license program 
the licensee is the employer of the temporary employees and the owner of the customer accounts receivable 
the company finances the licensees temporary employee payroll  payroll taxes and insurance 
this indebtedness is secured by a pledge of the licensees accounts receivable  tangible and intangible assets  and the license agreement 
borrowings under the lines of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the reference rate of bank of america  na plus two percentage points 
interest is charged on the borrowings only if the outstanding balance exceeds certain specified limits 
licensees are required to operate within the framework of the company s policies and standards  but must obtain their own workers compensation  liability  fidelity bonding and state unemployment insurance coverage  which determines their payroll costs 
the company s franchise and license agreements have an initial term of five years and are renewable for multiple five year terms 
the agreements generally contain two year non competition covenants which the company vigorously seeks to enforce 
efforts to enforce the non competition covenants have resulted in litigation brought by the company following termination of certain franchise agent and license agreements

the company s sale of franchises is regulated by the federal trade commission and by state business opportunity and franchise laws

for financial information about operating segments for fiscal years  and  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
seasonality the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations may continue 
operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the demand for the company s services  the level of competition within its markets  the company s ability to increase the productivity of its existing offices  control costs and expand operations and the availability of qualified temporary personnel 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be  and have in the past been  adversely affected by severe weather conditions 
the company s fourth fiscal quarter consists of or weeks  while its first  second and third fiscal quarters consist of weeks each 
moreover  the company s results of operations have also historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
demand for temporary staffing historically has been greatest during the company s fourth fiscal quarter due largely to the planning cycles of many of its customers 
furthermore  sales for the first fiscal quarter are typically lower due to national holidays as well as plant shutdowns during and after the holiday season 
these shutdowns and post holiday season declines negatively impact job orders received by the company  particularly in the light industrial sector 
customers the company services small and medium sized companies as well as divisions of fortune companies and local  state and federal government agencies 
as is common in the temporary staffing industry  the company s engagements to provide services to its customers are generally of a non exclusive  short term nature and subject to termination by the customer with little or no notice 
during fiscal  no single customer accounted for more than of the company s revenue 
the company s highest volume customers in fiscal accounted for an aggregate of of the company s revenue 
competition the temporary staffing industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry 
the company believes that the majority of commercial temporary staffing companies are local  full service or specialized operations with less than five offices 
within local markets  typically no single company has a dominant share of the market 
the company also competes for qualified temporary personnel and customers with larger  national full service and specialized competitors in local  regional  national and international markets 
the principal national competitors are adecco sa  spherion corporation commercial staffing segment  kelly services  inc us commercial staffing and international segments  manpower inc  remedytemp  inc clerical and light industrial services  express personnel services  inc  and randstad north america 
many of the company s principal competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  there are a number of medium sized firms which compete with the company in certain markets where they may have a stronger presence  such as regional or specialized markets 
the company believes that the competitive factors in obtaining and retaining customers include understanding customers specific job requirements  providing qualified temporary personnel in a timely manner  monitoring quality of job performance and pricing of services 
due to competitive pressures it has been difficult for the company to raise prices even though its costs may have increased 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in obtaining qualified candidates for temporary employment assignments are wages  benefits and flexibility and responsiveness of work schedules 
the company believes that within its primary light industrial and clerical administrative markets  timeliness of pay is also a key competitive factor 
management information systems the company s domestic management information systems provide support to both branch office locations and the corporate back office 
branch offices utilize a proprietary application designed to assist in candidate search  recruiting  customer order management  customer service  sales management and payroll entry and submission 
the application also provides for the sharing of information between branch offices and corporate headquarters 
utilizing this system  field offices capture and input customer  employee  billing and payroll information 
this information is electronically captured on centralized servers where payroll  billing and financial information is processed overnight 
these systems allow the company to print checks at its branch offices within hours after receipt of the timecard 
invoices are also processed daily and distributed from the company s centralized corporate office 
these systems also support branch office operations with daily  weekly  monthly and quarterly reports that provide information ranging from customer activity to office profitability 
each of the company s international operations have implemented customized or third party front office and or back office operating systems that are designed to meet the specific information technology and reporting requirements within the local jurisdiction 
risk management programs the company is responsible for all employee related expenses for the temporary staff employees of its company owned and franchise agent offices including workers compensation  unemployment insurance  social security taxes  state and local taxes and other general payroll expenses 
the company provides workers compensation insurance covering its domestic regular and temporary employees through a long term relationship with travelers property casualty company of america travelers 
the company is self insured in the states of ohio and washington

prior to fiscal  the company appealed western medical s medicare cost report settlement 
during the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of the favorable appeal settlement  the company recorded million in income from discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company resolved certain significant legal and liability claims and evaluated future risks associated with remaining pending claims 
as a result  million of income from discontinued operations was recognized and is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  as of october   the remaining net current liabilities of the discontinued medical operations of million are primarily for settled but unpaid legal claims 
the company believes it has adequately reserved for the reasonable outcome of future events  however  should actual costs differ materially from those estimated by management  the company would record additional losses or gains in future periods

item a 
risk factors factors affecting future operating results this form k contains forward looking statements concerning the company s future programs  products  expenses  revenue  liquidity and cash needs as well as the company s plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update this information  except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
numerous factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 
price competition in the staffing industry continues to be intense and pricing pressures from both competitors and customers may result in reduced sales and margins to the company 
the temporary staffing industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry and continues to undergo consolidation 
the company expects the level of competition to remain high in the future  and competitive pricing pressures will continue to make it difficult for the company to raise its prices even though its costs may have increased  and may have an adverse effect on the company s market share and operating margins 
the company competes in national  regional and local markets with full service agencies and with specialized temporary services agencies 
many competitors are smaller than the company but may enjoy an advantage over the company in discrete geographic markets because of their stronger local presence 
other competitors have greater marketing  financial and other resources than the company that  among other things  could enable them to attempt to maintain or increase their market share by reducing prices 
furthermore  there has been an increase in the number of customers consolidating their staffing services purchases with a single provider or with a small number of providers 
the trend to consolidate staffing services purchases has in some cases made it more difficult for westaff to obtain or retain business 
any significant recurrent economic downturn could result in the company s customers using fewer temporary employees  which could materially adversely affect the company 
demand for the company s staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and unemployment in the united states and the countries in which the company operates 
frequently  customers use temporary staffing services to manage personnel costs and staffing needs 
when economic activity increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
however  as economic activity slows  many customers reduce their utilization of temporary employees before releasing regular full time employees 
typically  the company may experience less demand for its services and more competitive pricing pressure during periods of economic downturn 
the recent domestic economic recession and resultant economic uncertainty had a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
a recurrent recession or a significant lag in economic recovery would likely have a further material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
unemployment insurance premiums and workers compensation costs and collateral for westaff s temporary employees may continue to rise and reduce westaff s margins and liquidity 
westaff is responsible for and pays unemployment insurance premiums and workers compensation costs for its regular and temporary employees 
in recent years  these costs have risen as a result of increased claims  general economic conditions and governmental regulations 
should these costs continue to increase in the future  there can be no assurance that westaff will be able to increase the fees charged to its customers to keep pace with increased costs and if it does not  its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was notified by the california employment development department edd that its california unemployment tax rates would be increased retroactively for both calendar and this rate increase was based on the edd finding that westaff s wholly owned domestic operating subsidiaries would be considered as a single reporting entity for california unemployment tax reporting purposes 
the company believes that it has properly calculated its unemployment insurance tax and is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
the company has timely appealed the assessment and the rate increase and is working with its outside counsel to resolve this matter 
the company accrued a portion of the increased tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal however  the company believes that it has strong defenses and legal arguments with respect to approximately million of the assessment and accordingly has not accrued for that portion of the assessment as of october  should the company ultimately prove unsuccessful in its appeal  the company would be required to record a charge for the unaccrued portion of the assessment and pay for the taxes out of its working capital 
westaff retains a portion of the risk under its workers compensation program see business risk management programs 
the estimated remaining deductible liability for all existing and incurred but not reported claims is accrued based upon actuarial methods using current claims information  as well as prior experience  and may be subsequently revised each quarter based on new developments related to such claims 
changes in the estimates underlying the claims reserve are charged or credited to earnings in the period determined  and therefore large fluctuations in any given quarter could materially adversely affect earnings in that period 
the company is contractually required to collateralize its obligations to its insurance carrier under these workers compensation insurance contracts through irrevocable letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
as of december   the company s aggregate collateral requirements under these contracts have been satisfied through million of letters of credit  however  under certain circumstances  the company may be required to increase its letters of credit to million 
as noted above  collateral requirements for the company s workers compensation program are significant and place pressure on the company s liquidity and working capital availability 
should the company be required to provide further collateral in addition to the fiscal payments  such additional collateral would reduce the company s borrowing capacity and its liquidity 
westaff s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified temporary personnel 
westaff depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified temporary personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of its customers 
westaff must continually evaluate and upgrade its base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
furthermore  a substantial number of the company s temporary employees during any given year will terminate their employment with the company and accept regular staff employment with customers of the company 
competition for individuals with proven skills remains intense  and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available to westaff in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to the company 
the failure to recruit  train and retain qualified temporary employees could materially adversely affect the company s business 
westaff s information technology systems are critical to its daily operations and the company initiated a process to replace these systems beginning in fiscal the company s domestic information management systems  located at a co location facility and corporate headquarters  are critical to daily operations of the company s business 
while backup and recovery systems are in place  should these key systems fail it could severely impact the company s business and operations  specifically its ability to timely and accurately pay employees and bill customers 
the company s domestic back office payroll and billing systems are at the end of their life cycle and are no longer supported by the companies who originally supplied them 
westaff currently utilizes internal support to maintain and update these systems 
this includes the process of applying updates to remain in compliance with tax mandates and other additional regulatory requirements 
this potentially creates exposure should an update not occur in a timely fashion  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in fiscal  the company successfully implemented two phases of its new enterprise wide information system 
these phases included regular staff human resource management payroll and core financials 
in fiscal  the implementation will continue and will include front office  temporary payroll and billing which will result in the retirement of our existing legacy systems 
this project will continue to require significant investments in consulting fees as well as significant internal personnel resources 
while the company anticipates a successful implementation  there can be no assurance that this initiative will yield the intended results 
delays in completing or an inability to successfully complete these technology initiatives could adversely affect the company s cash flow and operations 
westaff has significant working capital requirements and is heavily dependent upon its ability to borrow money to meet these working capital requirements 
the company requires significant amounts of working capital to operate its business and to pay expenses relating to employment of temporary employees 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
as a result  the company must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary personnel prior to receiving payment from customers 
the company finances its operations primarily through borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and also through cash generated by its operating activities 
as of december   the company s total borrowing availability was million  with million  million and million available in the us  uk and australia  respectively 
the amount the company is entitled to borrow under its us revolving credit facility is calculated each day and is dependent on the trade accounts receivable generated from operations  which are affected by financial  business  economic and other factors  as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows 
if the company experiences a significant and sustained drop in operating profits  or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays  the company may be subject to cash shortfalls 
if such a shortfall were to occur  for even a brief period of time  it may have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
furthermore  the company s receivables may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes  such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities  and the company would be less able to react to changes in the market or industry conditions 
the credit facilities contain covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the company has  in the past  failed to comply with certain of these covenants and has been required to obtain a waiver or amendment to the credit agreement from its lenders 
any future failure to comply with the covenants under the company s credit facilities could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could trigger prepayment obligations 
if the company were forced to refinance borrowings under the current facilities  there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or that such financing would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
even if such refinancing were available  the terms could be less favorable and the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates 
the company typically experiences significant seasonal and other fluctuations in its borrowings and borrowing availability  particularly in the us  and has  in the past  been required to aggressively manage its cash to ensure adequate funds to meet working capital requirements 
such steps included working to improve collections and adjusting the timing of cash expenditures  reducing operating expenses where feasible and working to generate cash from a variety of other sources 
the company has historically experienced periods of negative cash flow from operations and investment activities  especially during seasonal peaks in revenue experienced in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
in addition  the company is required to pledge amounts to secure letters of credit that collateralize certain workers compensation obligations and these amounts may increase in future periods 
any such increase in pledged amounts or sustained negative cash flows would decrease amounts available for working capital purposes and could have an adverse affect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
westaff may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect its business 
westaff is in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplace of other businesses 
attendant risks of these activities include possible claims by customers of employee misconduct or negligence  claims by employees of discrimination or harassment including claims relating to actions of westaff s customers  fines and costs related to the inadvertent employment of illegal aliens  payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims  violations of wage and hour requirements  errors and omissions of temporary employees  and claims by customers relating to employees misuse of customer proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  other criminal activity or torts or similar claims 
in addition  some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation  which could be time consuming to the company s management team as well as costly and therefore could have a negative effect on its business 
in some instances  westaff has agreed to indemnify its customers against some or all of these types of liabilities 
westaff has policies and guidelines in place to help reduce its exposure to these risks and has purchased insurance policies against certain risks in amounts that it believes to be adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that westaff s insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover these types of risks in the future 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that westaff will not experience these problems in the future or that westaff will not incur fines or other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems that could have a material adverse effect on westaff s business

the market for westaff s stock may be limited and the stock price may continue to be extremely volatile 
the average daily trading volume for westaff s common stock on the nasdaq national market was approximately  shares from january   through december   and there have been numerous days with virtually no trading in the stock 
accordingly  the market price of westaff s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations that have been  and may continue to be  exaggerated because an active trading market has not developed for the stock 
the company believes that the common stock price has also been negatively affected by the fact that the company s stock is thinly traded and the absence of analyst coverage 
the lack of analyst reports about the company s stock may make it difficult for potential investors to make decisions about whether to purchase the company s stock and may make it less likely that investors will purchase the stock  thus further depressing the stock price 
these negative factors may make it difficult for stockholders to sell the company s common stock  which may result in losses for investors 
westaff s business may suffer if it loses its key personnel 
westaff s operations are dependent on the continued efforts of its executive officers and senior management 
additionally  westaff is dependent on the performance and productivity of its local managers and field personnel 
westaff s ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of those key executive officers and senior management who have acquired experience in operating a staffing service company may cause a significant disruption to westaff s business 
moreover  the loss of westaff s key local managers and field personnel may jeopardize existing customer relationships with businesses that continue to use westaff s staffing services based upon past direct relationships with these local managers and field personnel 
either of these types of losses could adversely affect westaff s operations  including westaff s ability to establish and maintain customer relationships 
westaff derives a significant portion of its revenue from franchise agent operations 
franchise agent operations comprise a significant portion of the company s revenue 
for fiscal  of the company s total revenue was derived from franchise agent operations 
in addition  the company s ten largest franchise agents for fiscal based on sales volume accounted for of the company s revenue 
the loss of one or more of the company s franchise agents and any associated loss of customers and sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
westaff is subject to business risks associated with international operations and fluctuating exchange rates 
the company presently has operations in the united kingdom uk  australia and new zealand  which comprised of the company s revenue during fiscal operations in foreign markets are inherently subject to certain risks  including  in particular  different cultures and business practices  overlapping or differing tax structures  economic and political uncertainties  compliance issues associated with accounting and reporting requirements and changing  complex or ambiguous foreign laws and regulations  particularly as they relate to employment 
all of the company s sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies and  accordingly  the company is subject to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates which could cause a reduction in the company s profits 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
westaff is a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions from time to time  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
westaff is regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of its business and  in recent years  has paid significant amounts as a result of adverse arbitration awards 
the company does not have insurance for some of these claims and there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage it has will cover all claims that may be asserted against the company 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements not be covered by insurance or exceed its insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain appropriate and sufficient types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the company is subject to the risk of new regulations which could harm the company s business 
the company is subject to bills introduced in congress and various state legislatures  as well as in the foreign countries in which it operates  which  if enacted  could impose conditions that could have a negative financial impact on the company 
such conditions could include new or additional benefits  taxes or other requirements that may increase the company s costs of operations and reduce future earnings

item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company is periodically threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits 
the principal risks that the company insures against  subject to and upon the terms and conditions of its various insurance policies  are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
in september  westaff s australian subsidiary  together with several other entities  was named in a claim for contribution asserted by adi ltd 
the litigation originated in may  when a fire occurred at sea on board an australian navy ship 
the fire resulted in the death of four crewmen  and extensive damage to the ship 
an investigation determined that the fire was caused by the failure of fuel hoses installed by adi in the ship s engine room 
the commonwealth of australia filed a claim against adi which is estimated to have a value of approximately a million 
the investigation further found that mistakes were made in the installation process  including those of a technical supervisor placed by westaff with adi 
adi alleges that if it is liable to the commonwealth  then westaff is vicariously liable for the supervisor s negligence 
a defense to the claim has been filed on behalf of westaff 
trial is scheduled for september at this stage of the litigation  it is not possible to gauge the extent of potential liability of adi and the other defendants  including westaff  or the extent of insurance coverage that westaff may have in the event of an unfavorable outcome 
other than the action listed above  the company is not currently a party to any material litigation 
however  from time to time the company has been threatened with  or named as a defendant in litigation brought by former franchisees or licensees  and administrative claims and lawsuits brought by former employees 
management believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial condition of westaff  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october  cautionary statement this notice is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to forward looking statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed should be considered forward looking statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on those statements 
the forward looking statements in this discussion are made based on information available as of the date hereof and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements and to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business under the heading factors affecting future operating results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis by management and generally affect revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  impairment of goodwill  income taxes  including the realizability of deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are those most significantly affected by management s assumptions or the use of estimates  and are important to the understanding of its business operations and results from operations 
revenue recognition the company follows the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf recording revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in its presentation of revenue and costs of services 
this guidance requires the company to assess whether it acts as a principal in the transaction or as an agent acting on behalf of others 
where the company is the principal in the transaction and has the risks and rewards of ownership  the transactions are recorded gross in the statements of operations 
revenue and related costs of services generated by both company owned offices and franchise agents are included as part of the company s consolidated revenue and costs of services  respectively  since the company has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
the franchise agent acts as the company s agent and local business representative in a manner similar to a branch manager in company owned locations 
in the franchise arrangement  all advertising  signage  invoices and correspondence with the customer are in the company s name 
the company has the direct contractual relationships with its customers and contracts with customers are binding to the company 
the company is also the employer of all temporary employees in the franchise agents operations and  as such  is obligated for the temporary employee payroll and related payroll taxes regardless of customer acceptance of the temporary labor services 
these factors  among others  designate the company as a principal with respect to its franchise agents operations 
franchise agents sales represented  and of the company s total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution earned by the franchise agent for their services in marketing to customers  recruiting temporary employees and servicing customer accounts 
the company also has a licensing program in which the licensee has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  revenue and costs of services generated by the license operation are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company advances funds to licensees for payroll  payroll taxes  insurance and other related items 
fees are paid to the company based either on a percentage of revenue or of gross profit generated by the licensee and such license fees are recorded by the company as license fees and included in revenue 
as of october   the company had only one remaining licensee and is no longer offering license agreements to new prospects 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable balances for estimated losses projected to result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances  which were million and million at october   and october   respectively  are largely determined based on customers financial conditions  the company s historical experiences  interactions with customers and industry trends 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate to the point it would impair their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
workers compensation costs 
the company self insures the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  which was  per claim for policy years and and  per claim for policy year  and maintains accruals for these obligations 
these accruals amounted to million and million at october   and october   respectively 
the company accrues the estimated costs of these claims based upon the expected loss rates incurred within the various temporary employment categories provided by the company 
at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims actually made to date  as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the resulting calculation is partially based on the company s historical loss development trends as well as overall industry trends 
as a result of updates in the actuary s valuation  revisions are made to recorded liabilities 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual loss rates may exceed projected loss rates  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test at least annually or if events or circumstances change that may indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its book value 
intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company utilizes an independent third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of its individual reporting units 
the valuation methodologies considered include analyses of discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  publicly traded companies multiples within the temporary staffing industry and historical control premiums paid by acquirers purchasing companies similar to westaff 
as a result of the initial impairment tests upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in its australia operations 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended november  the company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
at october   substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result of the company s positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  the company s long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in the company s financial position  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company reversed its full domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company is periodically threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits  claims and pending actions 
the principal risks that the company insures against are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
if a potential loss arising from these lawsuits  claims and actions is probable and reasonably estimable  the company records the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
executive overview we believe that westaff made substantial progress during fiscal towards achieving its long term objectives of improved growth  sustained profitability and financial strength 
the following are some of the key westaff achievements during fiscal fiscal revenue increased million or as compared to fiscal despite a loss of sales from the divestiture of two of the company s significant franchise agents in november and august the company launched a permanent placement growth initiative in the us during fiscal which resulted in an increase in domestic permanent placement fees of for fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase in the fourth quarter permanent placement fees of as compared to the prior year fourth quarter 
gross margin improved to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal primarily as a result of stabilization of workers compensation costs  bill rate increases  changes in business mix and increased permanent placement fees 
the company generated income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a result of increasing market demand and the company s improved financial performance  the company is in the first phase of executing its plan to reinvest in its field office staff in an effort to grow its temporary staffing and permanent placement lines of service 
as of the end of fiscal  field office staff had been increased by over as compared to the end of fiscal the company is continuing to prudently invest in new staff as considered appropriate to help foster top line growth 
the company successfully completed a restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal which was designed to streamline and focus the organization  improve profitability and support expansion 
based on preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal  management believes the effect of the restructure is demonstrating positive results 
the company currently expects domestic revenue for the first quarter of fiscal to increase between and as compared to the fiscal first quarter 
in fiscal  the company invested million in capital expenditures  primarily relating to domestic business process management bpm system initiatives expected to result in a fully integrated  front office to back office system to help support future growth of the company as well as to provide opportunities for additional efficiencies and operating leverage 
the company has successfully implemented the first two phases of its bpm system including its human resources system for regular westaff employees and the core financial accounting and reporting systems 
the final phase  which will include fully integrated front office functionality along with payroll and billing for temporary associates  is currently scheduled to begin rollout starting late in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of positive cash flow from operations and the conversion of the majority of its domestic workers compensation cash collateral to letters of credit  the company ended fiscal with total borrowings under its revolving credit facilities of million as compared to million as of the end fiscal equally significant  the company reduced its domestic borrowings under its revolving credit facilities from million as of october  to million at october   in spite of the significant investment in bpm systems 
as of january   the end of the company s first fiscal quarter  there were no borrowings outstanding under the domestic revolving credit facility and the company had million of excess cash on hand 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its norway and denmark subsidiary operations 
this generated a gain of million as well as cash to the us of million  which includes million of intercompany debt repayment from norway 
we believe that this divestiture allows the company to focus its full efforts on its key markets of the us  uk  australia and new zealand 
as a result of the company s positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  the company s long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in the company s financial position  the company has determined that it is more likely than not that its domestic deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reversed its full deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
for fiscal  the company intends to focus on the following key operating objectives grow organically by prudently adding revenue generating staff while also seeking appropriate new markets to enter through new office openings 
firmly establish the company s permanent placement service line within the us and continue to generate significant growth and improved margins as a result of this business 
complete the initial implementation of the company s new business process management system and begin the roll out of the fully integrated system to the field offices 
carefully monitor the company s financial performance against its goals by establishing specific performance targets for each office and linking achievement of those goals with incentive plans 
the key objective will be to continue to foster the long term growth of the company while also seeking reasonable operating returns during fiscal launch a number of marketing campaigns during fiscal following some successful campaigns that we launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal continue to expand our base of regional and national account relationships 
as opportunities and financing allow  carefully consider potential strategic acquisitions that would provide access to important new markets  expansion within existing markets and opportunities to take immediate advantage of operating leverage 
in recent years  the company has carefully managed its expenses  exercised discipline in its management of cash  implemented prudent growth and business development initiatives and successfully restructured its field and corporate organization 
as a result  the company believes that is has positioned itself to take advantage of future opportunities within the staffing industry to grow revenue and improve its operating margins 
however  the company is also keenly aware of many of the business and economic risks connected with the staffing industry and intends to continue to be prudent in its investments and conservative in its use of cash 
discontinued operations effective june   the company sold its norway and denmark subsidiary operations to personalhuset as  a recruitment and staffing company headquartered in norway 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
additionally  as a part of the sale transaction  westaff norway repaid approximately million of intercompany debt to westaff us 
of the total proceeds  approximately million is being held in an interest bearing escrow account as security for potential westaff norway pension claims 
the escrowed funds  net of any claim payments  will be remitted to the company in june the company recorded a net gain on the sale of million 
the company has classified the operations as discontinued operations and  accordingly  has segregated the assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses of these discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto 
as required under the terms of the company s multicurrency credit agreement  the net proceeds from the sale of the norway and denmark operations were used to pay down borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility 
interest expense has been allocated to these discontinued operations in accordance with eitf during fiscal  the company discontinued its medical business western medical principally through a sale to intrepid usa under the terms of the sale  the company retained the majority of accounts receivable  including trade and medicare accounts receivable balances 
prior to fiscal  the company appealed western medical s medicare cost report settlement 
during the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of the favorable appeal settlement  the company recognized million of income from discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  the company resolved certain significant legal and liability claims and evaluated future risks associated with remaining pending claims and  as a result  recorded million of income from the medical discontinued operations 
as of october   there are remaining current liabilities of the discontinued medical operations of million  primarily for settled but unpaid claims 
results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal year revenue costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization arbitration expenses operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle less than fiscal compared to fiscal revenue increased million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal domestic revenue increased million or  while international revenue increased over fiscal the domestic revenue increase is the result of a decrease in billed hours of which was offset by an increase in average bill rates of 
the decline in domestic billed hours reflects the effects of the november divestiture of one the company s franchises  the august divestiture of another of the company s franchises and a shift in business mix in an effort to increase gross margin 
the increase in average bill rates reflects the generally more positive economic environment with lower national unemployment rates which allows the company to pass along bill rate increases to customers in certain circumstances 
permanent placement fees increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is virtually all attributable to westaff s domestic operations which grew from million in fees in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenue  permanent placement fees in the u 
s were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the company is continuing to invest in permanent placement consultants and expects this revenue to increase in the us during fiscal of the increase in international revenue noted above  is attributable to higher currency exchange rates 
international billed hours increased and average bill rates increased 
local currency revenue from australia increased as a result of strong national account sales growth 
local currency revenue in the uk declined during fiscal primarily due to offshoring of certain staffing functions by a number of westaff s uk customers 
the company was been aggressively working to increase its top line sales growth rates in the us 
during the first eight weeks of fiscal  domestic sales have increased over as compared to the prior year 
taking into consideration the timing of the fiscal holidays  the company currently expects domestic revenue for the first quarter of fiscal to increase to as compared to the fiscal quarter 
costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal gross profit dollars increased million  or  and gross margin increased to as compared to for fiscal gross margin increased primarily as a result of stabilization of workers compensation costs as noted below  bill rate increases  changes in business mix and increased permanent placement fees as noted above  partially offset by higher state unemployment insurance costs 
the company s workers compensation costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative and light industrial staffing 
unexpected adverse development of open claims and increases in the company s incurred but not reported ibnr claims can also significantly affect the level of accruals needed to cover workers compensation costs 
the company reviews interim and annual actuarial estimates and monitors claim activity to ensure that accruals remain appropriate in light of loss trends 
however  unanticipated adverse loss development trends can result in a need for additional charges to be recorded 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic workers compensation costs decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the fiscal fourth quarter included a charge of million to increase the company s domestic workers compensation reserves as a result of unfavorable loss development trends 
during fiscal the company increased its basic accrual rates for workers compensation which  combined with more stable loss trends  resulted in no such charge in fiscal the company aggressively works to close out claims on terms that are favorable to the company and continually monitors its costs and accrual rates in light of actual loss trends 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic state unemployment rates increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is largely due to an increase in the unemployment tax rate assessed in the state of california 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was notified by the california employment development department edd that its california unemployment tax rates would be increased retroactively for both calendar years and this rate increase was based on the edd finding that westaff s wholly owned domestic operating subsidiaries would be considered as a single reporting entity for california unemployment tax reporting purposes 
the company believes that it has properly calculated its unemployment insurance tax and is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
the company has timely appealed the ruling by the edd and is working with its outside counsel to resolve this matter 
the company accrued a portion of the increased tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal however  the company believes that it has strong defenses and legal arguments with respect to approximately million of the assessment and accordingly has not accrued for that portion of the assessment as of october  the company continues to focus its efforts on improving gross margin through development of its permanent placement service line as well as through increases in its billing rates 
management believes that there are opportunities to continue to improve gross margin during fiscal based on higher estimated permanent placement fees  potentially lower national unemployment rates which may allow for continued bill rate increases and potential continued stabilization of workers compensation costs and state unemployment insurance rates 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of the sales or gross profit generated by the franchise agents operations 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit was for both fiscal and fiscal in november the company sold one of its franchise agents operations  representing four franchise offices  back to the franchise agent 
revenue for this franchise agent comprised of total domestic revenue for the fiscal year ended october  in august the company sold one additional franchise agent operation  representing two franchise offices  back to the franchise agent 
year to date fiscal revenue for this franchise agent through the date of the sale comprised approximately of the company s fiscal domestic revenue 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal due primarily to investments in new and existing personnel along with associated benefits and payroll taxes 
as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company is continuing its investment in its field office staff  increasing full time equivalent positions by approximately as of the end of fiscal as compared to the prior year end 
these staff increases have been made to support the development of the company s domestic permanent placement line of business along with increasing staff in selected offices to help support future growth and business development 
additionally  the company has increased staffing to support the implementation of its new business process management system 
the fiscal fourth quarter included million of costs associated with a restructure while the fiscal second quarter included separation costs of million for the company s former chief executive officer 
selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal were reduced by a million gain on the sale of the executive headquarters building in walnut creek  california 
the fiscal fourth quarter included costs of million associated with an unfavorable arbitration ruling 
depreciation and amortization decreased million or  primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated partially offset by higher depreciation starting in the fourth quarter associated with the portions of the company s bpm system that have been placed in service 
the company expects depreciation expense to increase in fiscal as a result of the ongoing depreciation of the new bpm system 
interest expense decreased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower average borrowings outstanding during the year partially offset by higher average interest rates
