item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as part of this strategy  we have consolidated and closed certain manufacturing sites  upgraded equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinued production in a number of others that cannot support more advance technology platforms or products within our focus product segments 
we are actively considering a sale of our entire  or a significant portion of our  non focus product business with fiscal year revenues of million  and certain complementary products of our focus product segments with fiscal year revenues of approximately million the divestiture 
at june   our board of directors had not yet committed to a definitive plan to sell  but we had prepared a variety of strategic options for consideration 
any ultimate sale transaction will also require our board of directors approval  and is currently contemplated to include operations at our mumbai  india  borgaro  italy  xian  china  krefeld  germany  swansea  wales  and halifax  canada sites 
the divestiture will also include certain wafer manufacturing  product assembly and research and development equipment currently located at our temecula  california  tijuana  mexico and el segundo  california locations related to our non focus products 
if the contemplated divestiture is completed we will continue to retain the manufacturing facilities primarily used for our focus products 
marketing  sales and distribution we market our products through direct sales staff  representatives and distributors 
for our customers in our focus product segments  we primarily use direct sales staff and representatives  including field application engineers and technical sales support staff who may be better able to serve the customers needs 
for customers in the non focus product segments  we primarily sell through distributors 
for the fiscal year ended june   our product sales by region  based on the location of the customer  were percent from north america  percent from europe and percent from asia  which includes japan and asia pacific  compared to percent  percent and percent for north america  europe and asia  respectively  for the prior fiscal year ended june  our domestic direct sales force is organized into five regional sales zones 
in europe  our products are sold through our own sales force as well as through independent sales agents and distributors 
our european sales and representative offices are in austria  denmark  finland  france  germany  italy  sweden  switzerland  russia and the united kingdom 
in asia  we have sales representative or liaison offices in china  hong kong  india  japan  the philippines  singapore  south korea and taiwan 
we also have sales representative or liaison offices in australia  mexico and new zealand 
for financial information about the results for our geographic areas for each of the last three fiscal years  refer to note  segment and geographic information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the risks attendant to our foreign operations  see item  risk factors our international operations expose us to material risks 
because many applications require products from several product groups  we have organized our product development and marketing efforts by sector and application  rather than product type 
those general sectors are now reported within our defined segments 
in addition  our application engineers provide customers with technical advice and support regarding the use of our products 
we have increased the number of engineering offices to help support our focus products 
we believe the depth of our power management product line enhances our competitive position in the overall power semiconductor market 
customers our devices are incorporated in subsystems and end products manufactured by other companies 
our customers include oems  distributors and subcontract manufacturers 
no single oem customer  distributor or subcontract manufacturer accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  the majority of our products in our focus product segments  including those in the c c  esp and a d segments  are sold directly to oem customers 
however  two distributors  individually accounting for more than ten percent of c c s revenue  accounted for approximately percent of the segment s revenue for the fiscal year ended june  one of the distributors accounted for approximately percent of our cp revenue for the fiscal year ended june  one of the oem customers included at the table below accounted for approximately percent of our nap revenue for the fiscal year ended june  no single oem customer  distributor or subcontract manufacturer accounted for more than ten percent of the revenues in our other segments

competition we encounter differing degrees of competition for our various products  depending upon the nature of the product and the particular market served 
generally  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid price changes and product design changes 
several of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources 
we believe that we are differentiated from our competitors by our comprehensive line of power management products and our ability to combine these products into compact  cost effective packages and system level solutions 
our products compete with products manufactured by others on the basis of enabling capability  performance  reliability  quality  price  delivery time to customer and service including technical advice and support 
our major competitors in power management ics include intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  semtech and texas instruments 
our major competitors in power components include fairchild semiconductor  infineon technologies  mitsubishi  on semiconductor  philips  renesas  stmicroelectronics  toshiba and vishay 
aside from typical industry competitors  our power systems products often offer our customers an improved alternative to their internal manufacturing systems internally 
our major competitors by business segment are as follows business segment competitors computing and communications fairchild semiconductor  infineon technologies  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  national semiconductor  on semiconductor  philips  renesas  semtech  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments  vishay  and volterra energy saving products fairchild  infineon technologies  intersil  mitsubishi  national semiconductor  philips  renesas  stmicroelectronics  shindengen  texas instruments  toshiba and vishay aerospace and defense babcock  interpoint  microsemi  modular devices  ms kennedy  semelab  sensitron  vpt commodity products fairchild semiconductor  infineon technologies  matsushita  philips  renesas  stmicroelectronics  toshiba and vishay non aligned products mitsubishi  stmicroelectronics and toshiba we do not believe that the completion of the contemplated divestiture will substantially alter the competition that we face currently in the focus product segments remaining following the divestiture 
backlog as of june   our backlog of orders was million compared to million as of june  the increase in our backlog is primarily in our c c and esp segments  reflecting major new programs in game stations  servers  digital televisions  and energy efficient appliances 
backlog is comprised of purchase orders and customer forecast commitments scheduled to be shipped within the following twelve months 
given adequate notice  we usually allow customers to cancel purchase orders without penalty 
the amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by numerous factors  including the timing of the receipt of orders  changes in product mix  our ability to schedule the manufacturing or shipping of products and the availability of subcontract manufacturing 
the amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent on various factors and can vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
backlog by business segment as of fiscal years ended june  and is as follows in thousands computing and communications energy saving products aerospace and defense focus products backlog commodity products non aligned products non focus products backlog total backlog research and development our research and development program focuses on power management ics and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet  power fet and igbt product lines 
we have been developing and introducing some of the most advanced power management products and new architectures for the next generation of applications  including new game stations  servers  digital televisions  and energy efficient appliances 
we continue to commit to research and development to generate new patents and other intellectual property and concentrate on incorporating our technologies into our focus products 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  we spent million percent of revenue  million percent of revenue  and million percent of revenue  respectively  on research and development activities 
our design centers are located throughout the world  including the united states  canada  the united kingdom  denmark  italy  france  germany and singapore 
during fiscal year  we continued to introduce advanced power management solutions that drive high performance computing and save energy across our served markets 
these products also highlighted the company s focus on delivering integrated solutions and extensive applications support 
among them were a tailored imotion integrated design platforms for washers and air conditioners  b ics and chipsets improving power density and efficiency in dc dc applications found in high performance computers and servers  c the continued expansion of ir s popular xphase and directfet product families  d ics for class d audio and electronic lighting ballasts  e several application ready reference designs for point of load dc dc conversion  v isolated dc dc conversion  multi channel class d audio  and power factor correction  f ir s smartrectifier ic helping computer and consumer entertainment devices meet emerging system and standby power regulations  and g new radiation hardened dc dc converters and ultra low dropout uldo voltage regulators for military and aerospace applications 
if the contemplated divestiture is completed  it is anticipated that the canada and germany design centers that relate to our non focus products will be divested as part of the sale 
intellectual property we continue to make significant investments in developing and protecting our intellectual property 
in the past fiscal year  we added over patents worldwide 
we have approximately issued unexpired us patents and approximately  patent applications pending worldwide including us applications  foreign applications and applications filed under treaty 
our power mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
we have several registered trademarks in the united states and abroad  including the trademark hexfet and directfet 
we believe that our intellectual property contributes to our competitive advantage 
we are committed to enforcing our patent rights  including litigation if necessary 
through successful enforcement of our patents over the past decade  we have entered into more than license agreements  generated royalty income  and received substantial payments in settlement of litigation 
our broadest power mosfet patents were subject to  and have successfully emerged from  reexamination by the united states patent and trademark office 
we currently have license agreements with the majority of power mosfet manufacturers in the united states and abroad 
we report ongoing and one time royalties from the licensing and activities related to the enforcement of our patents and other intellectual property under the ip segment 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  we derived million  million and million of royalty revenues from license agreements  respectively 
however  the ip segment revenue is dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our mosfet technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such royalties is subject to a number of risks see item a  risk factors our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks 
aside from our mosfet technologies  our intellectual property strategy has been to use our intellectual property primarily for the design and development of a value added family of products  and to defend those products in the marketplace 
in our ip segment  we concentrate our efforts on the licensing of technologies or fields of use that have application beyond our product groups or which no longer align with our long term business strategies for our product groups 
we also target certain technologies for licensing that we believe help establish our product platforms and structures as industry standards and thereby  enhance the growth of certain products 
environmental matters federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the storage  use and discharge of certain materials  chemicals and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes  and on the operation of our facilities and equipment 
we believe we use reasonable efforts to maintain a system of compliance and controls for these laws and regulations 
despite our efforts and controls  from time to time  issues may arise with respect to these matters 
however  we do not believe that general compliance with such laws and regulations as now in effect will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
additionally  under some of these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if properties are contaminated or if waste is sent to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if it releases substances that damage or harm third parties 
we cannot make assurances that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as could any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
ir and rachelle laboratories  inc rachelle  a former operating subsidiary of ours that discontinued operations in  were each named a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation by the united states environmental protection agency epa of the disposal of allegedly hazardous substances at a major superfund site in monterey park  california oii site 
certain prps who settled certain claims with the epa under consent decrees filed suit in federal court in may against a number of other prps  including us  for cost recovery and contribution under the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
we have settled all outstanding claims that have arisen against us out of the oii site 
no claims against rachelle have been settled 
we have taken the position that none of the wastes generated by rachelle were hazardous 
counsel for rachelle received a letter dated august from the us department of justice  directed to all or substantially all prps for the oii site  offering to settle claims against such parties for all work performed through and including the final remedy for the oii site 
the offer required a payment from rachelle in the amount of approximately million in order to take advantage of the settlement 
rachelle did not accept the offer 
it remains the position of rachelle that the wastes were not hazardous 
our insurer has not accepted liability  although it has made payments for defense costs for the lawsuit against us 
we have made no accrual for potential loss  if any  however  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
we received a letter in june from a law firm representing udt sensors  inc relating to environmental contamination chlorinated solvents such as trichlorethene assertedly found in udt s properties in hawthorne  california 
the letter alleges that we operated a manufacturing business at that location in the s and or s and that we may have liability in connection with the claimed contamination 
we have made no accrual for any potential losses since there has been no assertion of specific facts on which to form the basis for determination of liability 
employees as of august   we employed approximately  people  of whom approximately  were employed in north america   in europe and in asia pacific and japan 
the only collective bargaining agreements to which we are subject apply to our employees in italy 
we have approximately employees in italy 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
as previously discussed  we are considering the sale of our entire non focus product business and certain complementary products within our focus product segments 
if a sale is completed  we currently believe up to  of our employees may be affected by the sale

item a 
risk factors statement of caution under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k report includes some statements and other information that are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the materials presented can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  should  view  or will or the negative or other variations thereof 
we caution that such statements are subject to a number of uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
factors that could affect our actual results include those set forth below under factors that may affect future results and other uncertainties disclosed in our reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  to reflect new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results changes in end market demand or downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry could affect our operating results and the value of our business 
we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales  changes in product mix sought by customers  seasonality  price competition for orders and the costs associated with the introduction of new products and start up of new facilities and additional capacity lines 
the markets for our products depend on continued demand with the product technological platforms and in the mix we plan for and produce in the information technology  consumer  industrial  aerospace and defense and automotive markets 
changes in the demand mix  needed technologies and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products  inventory and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the value of our business may decline during the down portion of these cycles 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the recent past and we cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to recover fully from its recent downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although markets for our semiconductors appear stable  we cannot assure you that they will continue to be stable or that our markets will not experience renewed  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future 
consumer and or corporate spending for the end market applications which incorporate our products may be reduced due to increased oil prices or otherwise 
our revenue and gross margin guidance is dependent on a certain level of consumer and or corporate spending for the specific mix of products we produce and have the capacity to produce 
if our projections of these expenditures fail to materialize  or materialize in a mix different from that for which we anticipate and build inventory  whether due to reduced consumer or corporate spending from increased oil prices or otherwise  our revenue and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
we maintain backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation  reduction or delay in delivery schedules  which may result in lower than expected revenue and margins 
with certain exceptions related to products within our aerospace and defense and non aligned product segments  we manufacture primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
for example  in our computing and communications segment  we have announced substantial new design or program wins in next generation game stations and are currently manufacturing and shipping on that basis 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand generally or in the mix of that demand 
accordingly  many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products  and a specific mix of products  without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to build them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory the value of our inventory  our revenue and our operating results generally 
additionally  cancellation or significant reduction in significant customer programs  like those for next generation game stations and servers  could materially affect our ability to achieve our revenue and margin targets 
we build and maintain inventory in order to meet our historic and projected needs  but cannot guarantee that our inventory will be adequate to meet our needs or will be usable at a future date 
at the end of fiscal year ended june   we reported net inventories of million 
we build and maintain inventory in order to meet our historic and projected needs  but cannot guarantee that the inventory we build will be adequate or the right mix of products to meet market demand 
if we do not project and build the proper mix and amount of inventory  our revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected 
additionally  if we produce or have produced inventory that does not meet current or future demand  we may determine at some point that certain of the inventory may only be sold at a discount or may not be sold at all  resulting in the reduction in the carrying value of our inventory and a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
the semiconductor business is highly competitive and increased competition could adversely affect the price of our products and otherwise reduce the value of an investment in our company 
the semiconductor industry  including the sectors in which we do business  is highly competitive 
competition is based on price  product performance  technology platform  product availability  quality  reliability and customer service 
price pressures often emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices or by offering a more desirable technological solution 
pricing and other competitive pressures can adversely affect our revenue and gross margin  and hence  our profitability 
we also compete in various markets with companies of various sizes  many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have  and thus they may be better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
failure to timely complete our expansion plans for our wafer fabrication facility could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to achieve our margin targets 
we operated at over percent of our worldwide in house wafer fabrication and assembly manufacturing capacities  without considering subcontract or foundry capacity 
during the fiscal year  our revenues were negatively affected by wafer fabrication constraints for certain fast growing focus products 
in order to meet the high demand for our focus products  we accelerated our capital expansion plans and added capacity to our wafer fabrication manufacturing facility in newport  wales 
in calendar year  we expect we will have added incremental production capacity of million to million in annual revenue from this facility 
we plan to use this fabrication capacity almost exclusively for our focus products 
if we fail to timely execute on our plans in advance of demand for our products  our revenues could be adversely affected which may prevent us from achieving our margin targets 
we cannot assure you that we will complete our plans timely  that the ramp up of the expanded facilities will occur effectively and without error or delay  or that sufficient third party sources would be available to satisfy our ability to meet customer demand 
even if we fully execute and implement our plans  we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient worldwide wafer fabrication and assembly manufacturing capacities to meet demand and there may be other unforeseen factors that could adversely impact our operating results 
delays in initiation of production at new facilities  implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies 
our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency 
our manufacturing and testing processes are complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continually being modified in our efforts to improve yields and product performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
technical or other problems could lead to production delays  order cancellations and lost revenue 
in addition  any problems in achieving acceptable yields  construction delays  or other problems in upgrading or expanding existing facilities  building new facilities  problems in bringing other new manufacturing capacity to full production or changing our process technologies  could also result in capacity constraints  production delays and a loss of future revenue and customers 
our operating results also could be adversely affected by any increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if net sales in the appropriate mix do not increase proportionately  or in the event of a decline in demand for some or all of our products 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully of transforming our business to one led by our focus products and succeeding on our plans to restructure our company  including our plan for the potential sale of our entire non focus products business 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
the failure to execute on our plans to divest or discontinue product lines that are not consistent with our business objectives  and replace those revenues with higher margin product sales could adversely affect our operating results 
we are actively considering a sale of our entire  or a significant portion of our  non focus product business fiscal year revenues of million  and certain complementary products of our focus product segments fiscal year revenues of approximately million the divestiture 
if the divestiture is completed  it is our goal that within the next couple of years  the remaining revenues will grow faster and the remaining business will be more profitable 
we do not believe that the completion of the divestiture will substantially alter the customer base that we serve or the competition that we face currently 
however  to achieve our goals  for a few quarters following a successful completion of the divestiture  we plan to more fully develop our focus product segments by realigning our sales  distribution and product development functions 
we will also configure our manufacturing and support infrastructure to address at least initially lower revenue levels 
despite our plans and efforts  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving our goals or carrying out plans for realignment 
completion of the divestiture may require us to be involved in a significant transition of the divested business and assets with the buyer 
we anticipate that the buyer may require manufacturing  sales and marketing and administrative support services  although we do not yet know the length of time the complete scope of support services that may be required 
the activities involved with the divestiture could involve changes to various aspects of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement our plans  there may be unforeseen factors that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the failure to implement and complete our restructuring programs and accomplish planned cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
in december  we announced a number of restructuring initiatives 
our goal was to reposition our company to better fit the market conditions and de emphasize our commodity business 
the restructuring includes consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
the restructuring also includes lowering overhead costs across our support organization 
we have substantially completed our restructuring plan and anticipate million to million in remaining charges 
however  there may be unforeseen factors that could result in additional amount of charges to be taken or otherwise adversely impact our profitability and business 
our products may be found to be defective and  as a result  product claims may be asserted against us  which may harm our business and our reputation with our customers and significantly adversely affect our results and financial condition 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated 
although we maintain rigorous quality control systems  we shipped large quantities of semiconductor devices in fiscal year to a wide range of customers around the world  in a variety of high profile and critical applications  and continue to do so 
in the ordinary course of our business we receive warranty claims for some of these products that are defective  or that do not perform to published specifications 
since a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers depending on applicable law and contract  we often need to defend against claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profit we receive from the products involved 
in addition  our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business 
even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims  we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer s business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation 
our results of operations and business would be adversely affected as a result of a significant alleged quality or performance issues in our products  if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result 
in addition  in our aerospace and defense segment  we are sometimes subject to government procurement regulations and other laws that could result in costly investigations and other legal proceedings as a consequence of allegedly defective products or other actions 
although we currently have product liability and other types of insurance  we have certain deductibles and exclusions to such policies and may not have sufficient insurance coverage 
we also may not have sufficient resources to satisfy all possible product liability or other types of product claims 
in addition  any perception that our products are defective would likely result in reduced sales of our products  loss of customers and harm to our business and reputation 
while we attempt to monitor the credit worthiness of our customers  we may from time to time be at risk due to the adverse financial condition of one or more customers 
we have established procedures for the review and monitoring of the credit worthiness of our customers and or significant amounts owing from customers 
however  from time to time  we may find that  despite our efforts  one or more of our customers become insolvent or face bankruptcy proceedings delphi is currently one such customer 
such events could have an adverse effect on our operating results if our receivables applicable to that customer become uncollectible in whole or in part  or if our customers financial situation result in reductions in whole or in part of our ability to continue to sell our products or services to such customers at the same levels or at all 
if some original equipment manufacturers oems do not design our products into their equipment or convert design or program wins to actual sales  a portion of our revenue may be adversely affected 
a design win or program award from a customer does not guarantee that the design or program win will become future sales to that customer 
for example  in our computing and communications segment  we have announced new design or program wins in next generation game stations  and our other segments have had other design or program wins 
we also are unable to guarantee that we will be able to convert design or program wins into sales for the life of any particular program  or at all  or that the revenue from such wins would be significant 
we also cannot guarantee that we will achieve the same level of design or program wins as we have in the past  or at all 
without design or program wins from oems  we would only be able to sell our products to these oems as a second source  if at all 
once an oem designs another supplier s semiconductor into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design or program wins with that oem s product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk 
achieving a design or program win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenue from that customer and we may be unable to convert design or program wins into actual sales 
corporate investment and expenditures in the information technology sector and in information technology purchases may not materialize as we have planned 
our revenue and gross margin guidance is dependent on a certain level of corporate investment and expenditures in the information technology sector and in information technology purchases 
if our projections of these expenditures fail to materialize  whether due to increased oil prices  change in market conditions  or otherwise  our revenue and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
new technologies could result in the development of new products and a decrease in demand for our products  and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand 
our failure to develop new technologies or react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in decreased revenue and a loss of market share to our competitors 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the semiconductor industry 
as a result  we must devote significant resources to research and development 
our financial performance depends on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce die sizes and improve manufacturing yields 
we cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals 
our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain technologies may negatively affect our financial results 
our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products  which is achieved in part by defending and maintaining the validity of our patents and defending claims by our competitors of intellectual property infringement 
we license certain patents owned by others 
we have also been notified that certain of our products may infringe the patents of third parties 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations  we cannot eliminate the risk of litigation alleging patent infringement 
we are currently a defendant in intellectual property claims and we could become subject to other lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our involvement in existing and future intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
if any such infringements exist  arise or are claimed in the future  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners  discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in such efforts or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms 
our failure to develop or acquire non infringing technologies or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms or the occurrence of related litigation itself could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to risks and continued levels of revenue in our ip segment is subject to our ability to maintain current licenses  licensee and market factors not within our control and our ability to obtain new licenses 
we have traditionally relied on our patents and proprietary technologies 
patent litigation settlements and royalty income substantially contribute to our financial results 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights is costly  risky and time consuming 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully continue to protect our intellectual property rights  especially in foreign markets 
our key mosfet patents expire between and  although our broadest mosfet patents expire in and our royalty income is largely dependent on the following factors the remaining terms of our mosfet patents  the continuing introduction and acceptance of products that are not covered by our patents  remaining covered under unexpired mosfet patents  the defensibility and enforceability of our patents  changes in our licensees unit sales  prices or die sizes  the terms  if any  upon which expiring license agreements are renegotiated  and our ability to obtain revenue from new licensing opportunities 
market conditions and mix of licensee products  as well as sales of non infringing devices can significantly adversely affect royalty income 
we also cannot guarantee that we can obtain new licenses to offset reductions in royalties from existing licenses 
while we try to predict the effects of these factors and efforts  often there are variations or factors that can significantly affect results different from that predicted 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee that our predictions of our ip segment revenue will be consistent with actual results 
we also cannot guarantee that our royalty income will continue at levels consistent with prior periods 
any decrease in our royalty income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our international operations expose us to material risks 
we expect revenue from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenue 
we maintain or contract with significant operations in foreign countries 
among others  the following risks are inherent in doing business internationally changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including tax laws in the united states and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  economic and political instability  and foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  certain of our operations and products are subject to restrictions or licensing under us export laws 
if such laws or the implementation of these restrictions change  or if in the course of operating under such laws we become subject to claims  we cannot assure you that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  it is more difficult in some foreign countries to protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as is possible in the united states 
therefore  the risk of piracy or misuse of our technology and products may be greater in these foreign countries 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operating results as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in the future 
delays in initiation of production at new facilities  implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities  defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes 
as a consequence  we have experienced delays in product deliveries and reduced yields 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenue 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenue does not increase proportionately 
we have transferred manufacturing from our krefeld  germany to our swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities 
we are ramping up our newport  wales facility 
we have experienced some delays and or technical problems in moving our various facilities 
continued delays and or technical problems in completing the remaining transfers could lead to increased costs  reduced yields  delays in product deliveries  order cancellations and or lost revenue 
interruptions  delays or cost increases affecting our materials  parts or equipment may impair our competitive position and our operations 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment  including silicon  mold compounds and leadframes  on a timely basis from third parties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment in a timely manner from our third party suppliers or if the costs of materials  parts or equipment increase significantly 
from time to time  suppliers may discontinue products  extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
we have a limited number of suppliers or sole suppliers for some materials  parts and equipment  and any interruption could materially impair our operations and adversely affect our customer relations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our wafer product at our temecula  california and newport  wales facilities 
any disruption of operations at those facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  some of our products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
we do not have any long term assembly agreements with these subcontractors 
as a result  we do not have immediate control over our product delivery schedules or product quality 
due to the amount of time often required to qualify assemblers and testers and the high cost of qualifying multiple parties for the same products  we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to assemble or test them 
any product delivery delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated 
we must commit resources to product manufacturing prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment 
we sell products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the manufacturing of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we receive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers and distributors 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has come from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
the loss or financial failure of any significant customer or distributor  any reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or distributors  or the cancellation of a significant order  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel required to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
personnel with the necessary semiconductor expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing key technical  sales  marketing and managerial employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we have acquired and may continue to acquire other companies and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we have acquired several companies over the past few years 
we may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future 
our common stock  which is traded on the new york stock exchange  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results  earnings below analysts estimates and financial performance and other activities of other publicly traded companies in the semiconductor industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent periods  our common stock  the stock market in general and the market for shares of semiconductor industry related stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
any similar fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our investments in certain securities expose us to market risks 
we invest excess cash in marketable securities consisting primarily of commercial paper  corporate notes  corporate bonds and governmental securities 
we also hold as strategic investments the common stock of two publicly traded japanese companies  one of which is nihon inter electronics corporation nihon 
while we have sold percent of our previous holdings in nihon  we have retained a percent interest 
the value of our investments is subject to market fluctuations  which if adverse  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and if sold at the down turn  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or financial reporting practices  we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud 
we are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls 
these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements  modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable 
as noted with the material weakness that we disclosed and remediated in fiscal year  while management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective or any assurance that the controls  accounting processes  procedures and underlying assumptions will not be subject to revision 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls and financial reporting practices  including collusion  management override  and failure of human judgment 
because of this  control procedures and financial reporting practices are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or if and for so long as management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if our system of controls and audits result in a change of practices or new information or conclusions about our financial reporting like the disclosed material weakness  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud and it could harm our financial condition and results of operations and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price 
large potential environmental liabilities  including those relating to a former operating subsidiary  may adversely impact our financial position 
federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes  and on the operation of our facilities and equipment 
we believe we use reasonable efforts to maintain a system of compliance and controls for these laws and regulations 
however  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective or that issues with respect to these matters will not from time to time occur 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls including the failure of human judgment 
under some laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
under other laws  we may be subject to fines and penalties if facilities or equipment are not operated in technical compliance with permit conditions or if required reports are not timely filed with applicable agencies 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
further  we cannot assure you that changes in environmental laws or regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future 
additionally  as we prepare for the contemplated divestiture of certain of our facilities  such facilities may undergo further environmental review and investigation which may lead to previously unknown environmental liabilities 
any present or prior failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to serious liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
some of our facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines 
our corporate headquarters  one of our manufacturing facilities  one of our research facility and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
we could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although we maintain earthquake insurance  we can give you no assurance that we have obtained or will maintain sufficient insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
semiconductor manufacturing requires a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we are also attempting to add the appropriate level and mix of capacity to meet our customers future demand 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  existing cash reserves and other equity or debt financings that we may obtain will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that alternative sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the maturity of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in july may expose us to risks 
we have outstanding in principal million of convertible subordinated notes due in july while we intend to refinance or pay down such notes prior to maturity  if we decide to refinance such notes  in whole or in part  we cannot guarantee that the terms  including interest rate and costs  would be comparable to the current interest rates and costs  and if higher  could adversely affect our future results 
additionally  if we elect in whole or in part to pay down such notes  it would lower the amount of funds we have available for operations or investment 
a failure to renew or replace our existing million revolving credit facility may expose us to risks 
our million revolving credit facility with bnp paribas as administrative agent expires in november while we currently intend to replace such facility with another facility of at least comparable size  we cannot guarantee that the size and terms including interest rate and costs  would be comparable to those under the current facility  and if adversely different  could adversely affect our future results 
additionally  if we do not replace or fail to replace such facility it would lower the amount of readily available funds for operations or investment 
unforeseen changes in market conditions  tax laws and other factors could impact our judgment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we have made certain judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on the belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets  after considering all available positive and negative evidence 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future given unforeseen changes in market conditions  tax laws or other factors  then the valuation allowances established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
our aerospace and defense segment is subject to governmental regulation that exposes us to additional risks 
our aerospace and defense segment manufactures and sells certain products that are subject to us export control laws and regulations 
the aerospace and defense segment also manufactures and sells products that are sold directly or indirectly to the us government and may subject us to certain government procurement regulations  investigations or review 
while we maintain a system of control of such products and compliance with such laws and regulations  we cannot provide absolute assurance that these controls will always be effective 
there are also inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls including the failure of human judgment 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of control or are otherwise found non compliant with applicable laws and regulations  violations could lead to governmental investigations  fines  penalties and limitations on our ability to export product  all of which could have a material affect on our results 
final outcomes from the various tax authorities audits are difficult to predict and an unfavorable finding may negatively impact our financial results 
as is common with corporations of our size  we are from time to time under audit by various taxing authorities 
it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter 
we have provided certain tax reserves which have been included in the determination of our financial results 
however  unpredicted unfavorable settlements may require additional use of cash and negatively impact our financial position or results of operations 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results 
natural disasters  like those related to hurricanes katrina and wilma  or occurrences of other natural disasters whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
natural disasters  like those related to hurricanes katrina and wilma  or threats or occurrences of other similar events  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
such events could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains  and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
while we do not have facilities located near the affected areas  such activities could affect physical facilities  primarily for raw materials and process chemicals and gases of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that natural events have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results

during the fiscal year ended june   we operated at over percent of our worldwide in house wafer fabrication and assembly manufacturing capacities  without considering subcontract or foundry capacity 
during the fiscal year  our revenues were negatively affected by wafer fabrication constraints for certain fast growing focus products 
in order to meet the high demand for our focus products  we accelerated our capital expansion plans and added capacity to our wafer fabrication manufacturing facility in newport  wales 
in calendar year  we expect we will have added incremental production capacity of million to million in annual revenue from this facility  although we cannot assure you that capacity constraints will not affect revenue growth in the future 
we plan to use this fabrication capacity almost exclusively for our focus products 
in addition to the facilities listed above  we have sales or technical support offices located in australia  canada  china  the czech republic  denmark  finland  france  germany  hong kong  hungary  india  italy  japan  mexico  new zealand  the philippines  russia  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  switzerland  taiwan  the united kingdom and the united states 
potential divestiture 
we are actively considering a sale of our entire  or a significant portion of our  non focus product business with fiscal year revenues of approximately million  and certain complementary products of our focus product segments with fiscal year revenues of approximately million the divestiture 
at june   our board of directors had not yet committed to a definitive plan to sell  but we had prepared a variety of strategic options for consideration 
any ultimate sale transaction will also require our board of directors approval  and is currently contemplated to include operations at our mumbai  india  borgaro  italy  xian  china  krefeld  germany  swansea  wales  and halifax  canada sites 
the divestiture will also include certain wafer manufacturing  product assembly and research and development equipment currently located at our temecula  california  tijuana  mexico  and el segundo  california locations related to our non focus products 
if the contemplated divestiture is completed  we will continue to retain the manufacturing facilities primarily used for our focus products 
item legal proceedings in june  we filed suit in federal district court in los angeles  california against ixys corporation  alleging infringement of our key us patents   and  the suit sought damages and other relief customary in such matters 
the federal district court entered a permanent injunction  effective on june   barring ixys from making  using  offering to sell or selling in  or importing into the united states  mosfets including igbts covered by our us patents   and or  in august  the court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed that injunction  pending appeal on the merits 
in that same year  following trial on damages issues  a federal district court jury awarded us million in compensatory damages 
the federal district court subsequently tripled the damages  increasing the award from million to approximately million  and ruled that we are entitled to an additional award of reasonable attorney s fees for a total monetary judgment of about million 
in march  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the summary judgment granted to us by the federal district court in los angeles of infringement by ixys of our us patents   and  the federal circuit reversed in part and vacated in part infringement findings of the district court  granted ixys the right to present certain affirmative defenses  and vacated the injunction against ixys entered by the district court 
the ruling by the federal circuit had the effect of vacating the damages judgment obtained against ixys 
the federal circuit affirmed the district court s rulings in our favor regarding the validity and enforceability of the three ir patents 
following remand a federal court jury in los angeles  california  held on september   that ixys elongated octagonal mosfets and igbts infringed our  patent but did not infringe our  and  patents 
on october   the jury awarded us million in damages 
based on the jury s verdict  on february   the district court entered its final judgment including permanent injunctions prohibiting ixys from further infringing sales for the remaining life of the  patent and found that we are entitled to million in compensatory damages for infringement through september   plus an additional percent of infringing sales after september  on july   the federal circuit entered an order vacating that judgment and remanded the ir v 
ixys action so that the district court could consider whether to reissue a permanent injunction in light of the supreme court s decision in ebay inc v 
mercexchange  llc  llc  s 
ct 
 l 
ed 
d 
we then requested that the district court re enter the final judgment and permanent injunction 
on september   the district court granted our motion and re entered the final judgment 
even though we expect ixys to appeal the judgment  we believe that it is reasonably assured that the value of the judgment is at least million and accordingly  for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized million by releasing a previous allowance related to the royalty income

certain reclassifications have been made to june  and cash used in investing activities 
previously  our investments in auction rate preferred securities were recorded in cash and cash equivalents rather than short term cash investments

for further information regarding our financial condition and results of operation  please read our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety  of which this is a part 
company and industry we are a designer  manufacturer and marketer of power management product devices which use power semiconductors 
power semiconductors address core challenges of power management  power performance and power conservation  by increasing system efficiency  allowing more compact end products  improving features and functionality  increasing fuel efficiency  and extending battery life 
our products are used in a variety of end applications  including computers  communications networking  consumer electronics  energy efficient appliances  lighting  satellites  launch vehicles  aircraft and automotive diesel injection 
in addition  we license our intellectual property to third parties 
according to isuppli  a market research firm  the market for power management semiconductors in calendar year will be approximately billion 
our products address approximately billion  or over approximately percent  of this market in calendar year we believe current demand for our products is driven largely by the following information technology demand for increased speed and functionality consumer and industrial demand for energy efficiency automotive demand for increased fuel economy aerospace and defense demand for advanced power management technology our products consist of power management integrated circuits  or power management ics  power components and power systems 
we report our results in six segments that generally reflect the products end markets and our decision making for our company about allocating resources  including the focus of research and development activities  and in assessing performance 
we also generate revenues by licensing and other activities related to the enforcement of our patents and other intellectual property 
we summarize our segments in two groups  focus products and non focus products 
our focus product segments are computing and communications c c  energy saving products esp  aerospace and defense a d  and intellectual property ip 
our non focus product segments are commodity products cp and non aligned products nap 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements  segment and geographic information for further details about our segments 
we market our products through direct sales staff  representatives and distributors 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and subcontract manufacturers 
for our customers in our focus product segments  we primarily use direct sales staff and representatives  including field application engineers and technical sales support staff who are able to better address our customers requirements 
for customers in the non focus product segments  we primarily sell through distributors 
no single oem customer  distributor or subcontract manufacturer accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  our research and development program focuses on power management ics and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet  power fet and igbt product lines 
we have been developing and introducing some of the most advanced power management products and new architectures for the next generation of applications  including the new game stations  digital televisions  high performance services  hybrid vehicles and energy efficient appliances 
we continue to commit to research and development to generate new patents and other intellectual property and concentrate on incorporating our technologies into our focus products 
in the fiscal years ended june   and  we spent million percent of revenue  million percent of revenue and million percent of revenue  respectively  on research and development activities 
we fabricate most of our chips in facilities designed to address the specific requirements of power semiconductors 
we believe our wafer fabrication costs are among the lowest in the industry 
we have wafer fabrication and or assembly production facilities in california  massachusetts  mexico  the united kingdom  italy  india and china 
we also use third party foundries and assemblers that provide us with capacity flexibility 
during fiscal year  we ramped up our inch 
micron capable wafer manufacturing facility in newport  wales united kingdom  to support our most advanced analog and mixed signal ics and trench mosfets 
in calendar year  we expect we will have added incremental production capacity of million to million in annual revenue from this facility 
we plan to use this fabrication capacity almost exclusively for our focus products 
potential divestiture 
we regularly review our products and technology portfolio to determine whether they are aligned with our long term strategic objectives 
we are actively considering a sale of our entire  or a significant portion of our  non focus product business with fiscal year revenues of approximately million  and certain complementary products of our focus product segments with fiscal year revenues of approximately million the divestiture 
at june   our board of directors had not yet committed to a definitive plan to sell  but we had prepared a variety of strategic options for consideration 
any ultimate sale transaction will also require our board of directors approval  and is currently contemplated to include operations at our mumbai  india  borgaro  italy  xian  china  krefeld  germany  swansea  wales  and halifax  canada sites 
the divestiture will also include certain wafer manufacturing  product assembly and research and development equipment currently located at our temecula  california  tijuana  mexico  and el segundo  california locations 
if the divestiture is completed  we plan to continue our strategy of growing our focus products business and achieving greater profitability 
we do not believe that the completion of the divestiture will substantially alter the customer base that we serve or the competition that we face currently 
for a few quarters following a successful completion of the divestiture  we plan to realign our sales  distribution and product development functions to a business based solely on our focus products 
we also plan to configure our manufacturing and support infrastructure to address the initially lower revenue levels following the divestiture 
as part of the divestiture we anticipate that we will provide certain manufacturing  sales  marketing and administrative support services to the buyer 
we do not yet know the length of time or level of all of the support services that may be required 
because the nature  timing  costs and reimbursements related to these services and other affects of the divestiture are not finalized  we cannot determine their impact on our financial performance or position

selling and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june   selling and administrative expense was million percent of revenues  compared to million percent of revenues for the fiscal year ended june   reflecting primarily new profit sharing and stock options expenses  and higher incentive bonuses and employee fringe benefit expenses  in fiscal year research and development expense for the fiscal year ended june  and research and development expense was million and million percent and percent of revenues  respectively  primarily reflecting increased research and development spending for ics and new profit sharing and stock options expense in fiscal year impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges during fiscal year second quarter ended december   we announced our restructuring initiatives 
under these restructuring initiatives  our goal was to reposition us to better fit the market conditions and de emphasize the commodity business 
our restructuring plan included consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
we also planned to lower overhead costs across our support organizations 
we have substantially completed these restructuring activities as of june  we estimate that total charges associated with the restructuring will be approximately million 
these charges will consist of approximately million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million of raw material and work in process inventory  and approximately million for severance 
of the million in total charges  we expect cash charges to be approximately million 
as of fiscal year ended june   we have realized savings of approximately million from the restructuring activities 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total restructuring related charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges and million for severance related costs 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total restructuring related charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges and million for severance related costs 
restructuring related costs were measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
asset impairments were calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining the asset groups  we grouped assets at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows information was available 
in determining whether an asset was impaired we evaluated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors such as changes in strategy and technology 
the undiscounted cash flows from our initial analyses were less than the carrying amount for certain of the asset groups  indicating impairment losses 
based on this  we determined the fair value of these asset groups using the present value technique  by applying a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows that is consistent with the rate used when analyzing potential acquisitions 
as of june   we had recorded million in total charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million for raw material and work in process inventory charges  and million for severance related costs 
components of the million asset impairment  plant closure and other charges included the following items as we emphasize more advanced generation planar products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facilities in temecula  california to decrease significantly 
these facilities had a net book value of million and were written down by million 
it is expected that these facilities will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
as we emphasize more advanced generation trench products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in el segundo  california to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
this facility had significantly reduced production as of fiscal year ended june   and is being used primarily for research and development activities 
as we emphasize more advanced generation schottky products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in borgaro  italy to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
it is expected that this facility will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
we are restructuring our manufacturing activities in europe 
based on a review of our swansea  wales facility  a general purpose module facility  we determined that this facility would be better suited to focus only on automotive applications 
the general purpose assembly assets in this facility  with a net book value of million  were written down by million 
in addition  we have substantially completed the move of our manufacturing activities at our automotive facility in krefeld  germany to our swansea  wales and tijuana  mexico facilities as of june  we have also moved the production from our venaria  italy facility to our borgaro  italy and mumbai  india facilities  which was completed as of december  we stopped manufacturing activities in our oxted  england facility as of september  we have eliminated the manufacturing of our non space military products in our santa clara  california facility as of july  currently  subcontractors handle our non space qualified products formerly manufactured in this facility 
we have also transitioned the assembly and test of non space power components from our leominster  massachusetts facility to our tijuana  mexico facility  as of december  associated with this reduction in manufacturing activities  certain assets with a net book value of million were written down by million 
million in other miscellaneous items were charged  including million in relocation costs and other impaired asset charges and million in contract termination and settlement costs 
as a result of the restructuring initiatives  certain raw material and work in process inventories were impaired  including products that could not be completed in other facilities  materials that were not compatible with the processes used in the alternative facilities  and materials such as gases and chemicals that could not readily be transferred 
based on these factors we wrote down these inventories to their net realizable value  with a carrying value of million  by million 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  we had disposed of million  million and million  respectively  of these inventories  which did not have a material impact on gross margin for the fiscal years then ended 
as of june   million of these inventories remained to be disposed 
our restructuring activities were expected to result in severance charges of approximately million through june below is a table of approximate severance charges by major activity and location location activity amount el segundo  california close manufacturing facilities million santa clara  california and leominster  massachusetts eliminate certain manufacturing activities million oxted  england close manufacturing facility million veneria  italy move manufacturing to india and discontinue certain products million company wide realign business processes million total million to date  of the million noted above  we have recorded million in severance related charges million in severance termination costs related to approximately  administrative  operating and manufacturing positions  and million in pension termination costs at our manufacturing facility in oxted  england 
for the fiscal years ended june  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in severance termination costs and million and  respectively  in pension termination costs 
the severance charges associated with the elimination of positions  which included the  employees notified to date  had been and will continue to be recognized ratably over the future service period  as applicable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we measured the total termination benefits at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date 
a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash over the future service period will be measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to initially measure the liability 
the cumulative effect of the change will be recognized as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
in fiscal  we had recorded an estimated million in severance costs associated with the acquisition of technofusion gmbh in krefeld  germany 
in fiscal  we finalized our plan and determined that total severance would be approximately million  and accordingly  we adjusted purchased goodwill by million 
we communicated the plan and the elimination of approximately positions primarily in manufacturing to its affected employees at that time 
we have completed the restructuring of our krefeld facility as of december   and determined that million of the severance reserve was excess 
accordingly  we decreased technofusion purchased goodwill by million 
the following summarizes our severance accrued related to the june restructuring  the technofusion acquisition and the december restructuring plan for the fiscal years ended june   and severance activity related to the elimination of administrative and operating personnel as part of the june restructuring is also disclosed

our licensed mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and commodity products for the fiscal year ended june   cp revenue was million  down five percent from million in the fiscal year ended june   as we continued to discontinue certain low margin business opportunities in fiscal year gross margin for our cp segment was percent for the fiscal year ended june   and percent in the prior fiscal year 
non aligned products nap revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million  decreasing two percent from million in the fiscal year ended june  gross margin for our nap segment improved to percent for the fiscal year ended june   from percent in the prior fiscal year  reflecting greater manufacturing efficiency from increased capacity utilization and restructuring cost savings 
selling and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june   selling and administrative expense was million percent of revenues  compared to million percent of revenues for the fiscal year ended june  the decline in the selling and administrative expense ratio primarily reflected a higher revenue base in the current year compared to the prior year and our cost containment efforts 
the absolute selling and administrative expense increase primarily reflected sales commissions and other variable costs paid on a higher revenue base 
research and development expense for the fiscal year ended june  and  research and development expense was million and million percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenditures increased reflecting continued development efforts on our focus products across our c c  esp and a d segments 
approximately percent of the fiscal year spending was related to new technology and product development for our focus products across our c c  esp and a d segments 
impairment of assets  restructuring and severance charges for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total restructuring related charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges and million for severance related costs

r 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized million in one time pretax gains from the hitachi settlement  net of legal costs and related expenses 
interest income and expense interest income was million and million for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in income reflected higher prevailing interest rates and higher average cash and cash investment balance in the current year 
interest expense was million and million for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in current period expense primarily reflected higher effective interest rate payable on our million convertible subordinated notes outstanding see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  bank loans and long term debt regarding the modification of the effective interest payable on our convertible notes 
income taxes our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended june  and  was percent and percent  respectively  rather than the expected us federal statutory tax rate of percent  as a result of lower statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of foreign tax credits and research and development credits  partially offset by state taxes and certain foreign losses without foreign tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and cash equivalent balances of million and cash investments of million 
our cash  cash equivalents  cash investments and unused credit facilities of million  totaled billion 
as of june  our investment portfolio consists of available for sale fixed income and investment grade securities 
during the fiscal year ended june   operating activities generated cash flow of million compared to million generated in the prior fiscal year 
cash flow from operations included million of depreciation and amortization and million of tax benefit from options exercised for the twelve months ended 
cash flow from operations excluded million of excess tax benefit from options exercised as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash by million 
the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory as we prepare for the record order and backlog as of the fiscal year ended june   and a higher accounts receivable balance primarily due to average extended payment terms in japan  partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued salaries and wages  and accrued taxes due to timing of cash payments 
during the fiscal year ended june   cash used in investing activities totaled million 
proceeds from sales or maturities of cash investments were million  while purchases were million for the twelve months ended june  as discussed in note  related party transactions  we sold million shares of our investment in nihon inter electronics corporation  which contributed million 
we invested million in capital expenditures  reflecting an increase of percent over the prior fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal years ended june  and  we operated at over percent of our worldwide in house wafer fabrication and assembly manufacturing capacities  without considering subcontractor or foundry capacity 
during the first half of our fiscal year  our revenues were negatively affected by wafer fabrication constraints for certain fast growing focus products 
in order to meet the high demand for our focus products  we accelerated our capital expansion plans and added capacity to our wafer fabrication manufacturing facility in newport  wales 
in calendar year  we expect we will have added incremental production capacity of million to million in annual revenue from this facility  although we cannot assure you that capacity constraints will not affect revenue growth in the future 
we plan to use this fabrication capacity almost exclusively for our focus products 
at june   we had purchase commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million  the majority of which is at our newport facility 
we intend to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements through cash and cash equivalents on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations and available credit facilities 
financing activities during the fiscal year ended june  generated million 
as discussed in note  bank loans and long term debt  in june  our subsidiary in singapore entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na boa 
proceeds from the credit agreement contributed million 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options contributed million 
cash flows from financing activities included million of excess tax benefit from options exercised as a result of the adoption of the sfas no 
r 
as of june   we had revolving  equipment and foreign credit facilities of million  against which million had been used 
as discussed in note  derivative financial instruments  we are required to obtain irrevocable standby letters of credit in favor of jp morgan chase bank  for million plus the collateral requirement for the december and april interest rate swap transactions  as determined periodically 
at june   million in letters of credit were outstanding related to these transactions 
the collateral requirement of the transactions may be adversely affected by an increase in the five year libor curve  a decrease in our stock price  or both 
we cannot predict what the collateral requirement of the transactions and the letter of credit requirement will be over time 
to illustrate the potential impact  had a percent increase in the five year libor curve and a percent decrease in our stock price occurred at the close of the fiscal quarter ended june   our letter of credit commitment would have increased by million to million 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of june  as of june   the following lists our contractual obligations for the next five years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years years years thereafter long term debt interest payable on convertible notes operating leases capital equipment purchase commitments total we believe that our current cash and cash investment balances  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  including unused amounts under the million credit facility with bnp paribas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  bank loans and long term debt  will be sufficient to meet our currently foreseeable operating cash requirements and to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they occur in the next twelve months 
the credit facility with bnp paribas will expire in november and we intend to replace this with another million facility 
our million convertible subordinated notes are due in july we anticipate that these notes will be refinanced through public or private offerings of debt or equity  or be paid down with our existing cash and cash investments 
the credit agreement entered into by our singapore subsidiary with bank of america  na is due in june  which we anticipate may be refinanced or be paid down with the existing cash and cash investments at that time 
although we believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient for normal operating activities  we may also consider the use of funds from other external sources  including  but not limited to  public or private offerings of debt or equity 
recent accounting pronouncement in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
this interpretation requires that the impact of a tax position be recognized if it is more likely than not of being sustained in an audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin no 
also provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin no 
excludes income taxes from the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin no 
is effective beginning with our fiscal first quarter ended september  of fiscal year we are currently assessing the impact of fin no 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition and allowances in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when the evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery or performance of service has occurred 
we recognize the majority of revenues upon shipment for product sales to all customers  including distributors  with provisions for estimated returns and allowances recorded at the time of shipment 
certain customers have limited rights of returns and price protection programs 
we continuously monitor product returns and potential price adjustments and records a provision for these based on known credits and historical experience 
while such credits have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same predictability in estimating returns and allowances 
if the historical data and estimates we used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could be impacted 
certain of our customers contracts contain substantive acceptance provisions 
in such circumstances  we recognize revenue in accordance with specific contract acceptance provisions  in most instances upon customer inspection or upon delivery of proof of conformance to customer specifications 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed for excess and obsolescence based upon demand forecasts within a specific time horizon and reserves are established accordingly 
if actual market demand differs from our forecasts  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially impacted 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income 
valuation allowances are established for the deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
judgments regarding future taxable income may be revised due to changes in market conditions  tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future  then the valuation allowances established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize certain tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit findings in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which additional taxes would be due  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if the audit findings result in actual taxes owed more or less than what we had anticipated  our income tax expense would be increased or decreased  accordingly  in the period of the determination 
us income taxes have not been provided on approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since we consider these earnings to be invested indefinitely or offset by foreign tax credits 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred us taxes on these undistributed earnings 
loss contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that we provide an allowance for the estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
requires that we disclose material loss contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and whether we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to assess whether such accruals should be adjusted 
if the actual outcome of the legal proceeding or claim differs from our assessment  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially impacted 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
share based payment sfas no 
r to account for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is based on an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments 
derivatives our primary objectives for holding derivative financial instruments are to hedge non us currency risks and minimize non us interest rate risk 
we have entered into short and long term foreign exchange forward contracts with various banks  to hedge the variability in cash flows from foreign currency fluctuations 
we have not designated the short term forward contracts as accounting hedges and their unrealized gains or losses are included in the current period s other income or expense 
the fair values of the forward contracts are based on reuters published rates on the trade date 
we anticipate that the settlement and the mark to market of the short term forward contracts will offset the income statement impact from revaluing the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
to the extent the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts are materially different than the balance of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  our operating results  financial position and cash flows may be materially impacted 
to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on million of quarterly forecasted intercompany purchases by our japan subsidiary  we have entered into a five year forward contract with bnp paribas in may this contract replaced the march five year forward contract that expired in march  which hedged million of quarterly forecasted intercompany purchases by our japan subsidiary 
the forward contracts qualified and were designed as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which required that the mark to market adjustments be recorded in other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity  until the forecasted transactions are recorded in earnings 
we evaluate the effectiveness of the cash flow hedges based on updated forecasts of intercompany purchases by our japan subsidiary through the contract expiration date 
based on this test  if we determine that the original hedged transaction will probably not occur as anticipated  and the cash flow hedge is to be discontinued  any unrealized gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income would be reclassified into earnings 
our forecasted intercompany purchases by our japan subsidiary is dependent on a number of factors  including sale of certain products and maintaining certain customer relationships  which if different from originally forecasted  may cause the cash flow hedge to be materially ineffective  and thereby  have a material impact on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to modify the effective interest payable on our million convertible notes from a fixed coupon rate of percent to a variable rate that is based on the london interbank offered rate 
the swap transactions qualified and were designated as fair value hedges  which required that the swaps and the convertible notes be marked to market through interest expense 
we use a regression analysis to measure the effectiveness of the interest rate swaps  and the changes in the fair value of the swaps is materially offset by the mark to market adjustments on the debt 
our million convertible notes mature in july  and we anticipate that the notes may be refinanced through public or private debt or equity offering or be paid down with our available cash and cash investments 
we plan that the interest rate swaps would be terminated at the same time the underlying debt is terminated 
however  the timing of the debt and swap terminations may be subject to certain events outside of our control  which could result in material impact on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
long lived assets long lived assets are property  plant and equipment and purchased or internally developed software 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to a significant change in business strategy or in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant negative change in the business climate  industry conditions  economic conditions or market value of an asset  and current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets based on the expected undiscounted cash flows for their asset group as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  without regard to taxes 
impairments  if any  are recognized based upon the fair value of the assets 
fair value is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
we use the undiscounted cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate that is representative of the discount rate used when evaluating potential acquisitions 
in developing the cash flow projections  we use revenue and cost assumptions based on current levels adjusted for anticipated future market conditions 
if these market conditions do not materialize  the cash flow forecasts could be materially impacted 
goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets we classify the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition as goodwill 
we classify intangible assets apart from goodwill if the assets have contractual or other legal rights or if the assets can be separated and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
depending on the nature of the assets acquired  the amortization period may range from four to twelve years for those acquisition related intangible assets subject to amortization 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets  including the related amortization period  in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  we complete the two step goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we identify the reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  in order to assess goodwill for impairment 
in the first of a two step impairment test  we determine the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model  and assume certain revenues and costs based on current levels adjusted for anticipated future market conditions 
we have also assumed fair values based on current market bids for certain of our reporting units  which may differ significantly from the actual sale amount if we are to sell the reporting units 
any significant negative variances in actual results from our assumptions could potentially indicate impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets at one or more of our reporting units 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analyses  as well as risks set forth under the heading factors that may affect future results 
interest rate risk our financial assets and liabilities subject to interest rate risk are cash investments  variable rate convertible notes and bank loan  credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
our primary objective is to preserve principal while maximizing net investment yield without significantly increasing risk 
at june   we evaluated the effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on these transactions 
a change of as much as ten percent in the london interbank offered rate libor would have had an annualized favorable impact of approximately million on net interest income expense since the interest income on our cash and cash investments would have outweighed additional interest expense on our variable rate debt 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the transaction with jp morgan chase bank the bank  to modify our effective interest payable with respect to million of our million outstanding convertible debt the debt see notes  derivative financial instruments  and  bank loans and long term debt 
at the inception of the transaction  interest rates were lower than that of the debt and we believed that interest rates would remain lower for an extended period of time 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the april transaction with the bank to modify the effective interest payable with respect to the remaining million of the debt 
the variable interest rate we have paid since the inception of the swap has averaged percent  compared to a coupon of percent on the debt 
during the fiscal year ended june   these arrangements increased interest expense by million 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  these arrangements reduced interest expense by million and million  respectively 
accounted for as fair value hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the mark to market adjustments of the two transactions were offset by the mark to market adjustments on the debt  resulting in no material impact to earnings 
to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship  we use a regression analysis 
to evaluate the relationship of the fair value of the transaction and the changes in fair value of the debt attributable to changes in the benchmark rate  we discount the estimated cash flows by the libor swap rate that corresponds to the debt s expected maturity date 
in addition  our ability to call the debt was considered in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
for those years that were projected to include at least a portion of redemption of the convertible debentures  we employed a valuation model known as a monte carlo simulation 
this simulation allows us to project probability weighted contractual cash flows discounted at the libor swap rate that corresponded to the debt s expected maturity date 
the market value of the december transaction was a million liability and a million liability at june  and  respectively 
the market value of the april transaction was a million liability and a million liability at june  and  respectively 
at june   we had million in letters of credit outstanding as part of the collateral requirement on these transactions 
the collateral requirement of the transactions may be adversely affected by an increase in the five year libor curve  a decrease in our stock price  or both 
we cannot predict what the collateral requirement of the transactions and the letter of credit requirement will be over time 
to illustrate the potential impact  had a percent increase in the five year libor curve and a percent decrease in our stock price occurred at the close of the fiscal quarter ended june   our letter of credit commitment would have increased by million to million 
in april  we entered into an interest rate contract the contract with an investment bank  lehman brothers lehman  to reduce the variable interest rate risk of the transaction 
the notional amount of the contract is million  representing approximately percent of the debt 
under the terms of the contract  we have the option to receive a payout from lehman covering our exposure to libor fluctuations between percent and percent for any four designated quarters 
the market value of the contract at june  and  was million and million  respectively  and was included in other long term assets 
interest expense was decreased by mark to market gains of million for the fiscal year ended june  and increased by mark to market losses of million and million  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
as of june   an increase of ten percent in interest rates would have had a favorable impact of million  and a decrease of ten percent in interest rates would have had an adverse impact of million  on net interest income expense 
foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in several foreign currencies  and at various times  we have currency exposure related to the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
our risk to the european currencies is partially offset by the natural hedge of manufacturing and selling goods in both us dollars and the european currencies 
considering our specific foreign currency exposures  we have the greatest exposure to the japanese yen  since we have significant yen based revenues without yen based manufacturing costs 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using foreign exchange forward contracts  including the forward contract described below  to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established revenue  expense and balance sheet hedging programs 
currency forward contracts and local yen and euro borrowings are used in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we considered an adverse near term change in exchange rates of ten percent for the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
such an adverse change  after taking into account our derivative financial instruments and offsetting positions  would have resulted in an annualized favorable impact on income before taxes of million for the fiscal year ended june  in march  we entered into a five year foreign exchange forward contract the forward contract for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany purchases by our subsidiary in japan which expired in march we designated the forward contract as a cash flow hedge under which mark to market adjustments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity  until the forecasted transactions are recorded in earnings 
under the terms of the forward contract  we were required to exchange billion yen for million on a quarterly basis from june to march the mark to market gains losses  net of tax  of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were included in other comprehensive income 
in may  following the expiration of our march forward contract in march  we entered into another five year foreign exchange forward contract with bnp paribas the may forward contract for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany purchases by our japan subsidiary 
we have designated the may forward contract as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the may forward contract  we are required to exchange million yen for million on a quarterly basis starting in june and expiring in march at june   quarterly payments of million yen remained to be swapped at a forward exchange rate of yen per us dollar 
the market value of the may forward contract was million  included in other assets  at june  and the mark to market gains  net of tax  of million for the fiscal year ended june   were included in other comprehensive income 
based on effectiveness tests comparing forecasted transactions through the may forward contract expiration date to its cash flow requirements  we do not expect to incur a material charge to income during the next twelve months as a result of the may forward contract 
we had approximately million and million in notional amounts of forward contracts which were not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
at june  and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized foreign currency gains recognized in earnings were million for the fiscal year ended june   million for the fiscal year ended june  and less than million for the fiscal year ended june
