as of february   the retail operations segment owned and operated card and gift shops throughout north america 
our international operations include wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom uk  canada  australia  new zealand  mexico and south africa  as well as licensees in approximately other countries 
our business exhibits seasonality  which is typical for most companies in the retail industry 
sales are higher in the second half of the year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
net earnings are highest during the months of september through december when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage 
working capital requirements needed to finance operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as inventory is increased in preparation for the peak selling season 
we recognized net income of million in compared to million in included in the results this year is the net loss from discontinued operations of million resulting primarily from the planned divestiture of our south african business 
the prior year results included income from discontinued operations of million primarily from our divestiture of the magnivision reading glasses subsidiary in october cash flow generation remained strong and we ended the year with a combined balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
during the year  and in our planning for next year  we continue to focus on two key operational and financial strategies 
our operational strategy of investing in growth is focused on strengthening our core greeting card business 
this strategy targets improved card product and the merchandising of that product to enrich our consumers shopping experience 
this represents the next step in the process we have been following the past few years as we worked to stabilize the infrastructure of the business  reduce costs  modify business processes relative to product development  sourcing and delivery systems and become a consumer driven organization 
in executing this next step  we have committed approximately million to converting customers to scan based trading  refreshing product at retail  implementing new delivery systems and improving the merchandising of our product  including new and enhanced display fixtures 
these expenditures  which we expect to be weighted toward the second half of the year  will significantly reduce our operating earnings during fiscal 
table of contents our financial strategy focuses on optimizing our capital structure  which includes investing in our own stock as we continue to believe that our shares are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value and refinancing our debt 
during  we completed the million stock repurchase program announced in april and initiated another million stock repurchase program in february 
for the year  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million 
on april   we announced our plan to significantly change our debt structure 
we expect that these changes  along with our continued strong cash generation  will permit us to simultaneously execute these strategies 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the debt refinancing plan 
during  we continued the implementation of the initiatives  including the implementation of a new merchandising strategy for seasonal space management  an overhead reduction program and the closure of the franklin  tennessee manufacturing facility 
the operational benefits and cost savings from these initiatives favorably impacted results and we anticipate will provide an even greater impact in the future 
continuing our commitment to improve efficiency and cost reduction  in  we announced the planned closure of the lafayette  tennessee facility and made additional reductions to overhead at a total cost of approximately million 
in reporting our results  we noted that due to declining results and cash flows during the past two years  the fair value of the retail operations segment and our australian business  determined for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment  had declined and as a result we established performance metrics to monitor these businesses for potential indicators of impairment 
during the third quarter of  indicators emerged within these businesses that led us to conclude that an interim goodwill impairment test was required 
as a result of this testing  we recorded an impairment charge to write off the goodwill of these business units  totaling million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impairment charge 
net sales for were flat compared to the prior year  however the amounts included the impact of converting a major customer to scan based trading and the implementation of a new strategy for seasonal space management  which reduced net sales by approximately million and million  respectively 
net sales in the international social expression products segment  primarily in the uk  the retail operations segment and the fixtures business were down  while net sales in the ag interactive segment improved 
for  ag interactive changed its fiscal year end from december to february due to this change  our results in included fourteen months of activity for ag interactive  which added approximately million to net sales for the year with no impact on net income

the north american social expression products segment  considering the million prior year net sales reduction  decreased approximately million due to significantly lower sales of promotional gift wrap and calendars  partially offset by strengthening in the greeting card business 
the fixtures business decreased approximately million as this business unit has focused on eliminating lower margin sales 
the international social expression products segment decreased approximately million  primarily due to continued weak economic conditions in the uk these decreases are partially offset by increased net sales in the ag interactive segment of approximately million as well as approximately million of favorable foreign currency translation

exclusive of these prior year events  combined everyday and seasonal greeting card sales less returns decreased in compared to  including an overall decrease in unit volume of approximately 
the reduction in seasonal card unit volume was the result of year over year decreases in all major seasonal programs with the exception of father s day 
the increase in average selling price of seasonal cards was due to improved product mix of mother s day  christmas and valentine s day cards  driven primarily by a lower volume of value priced cards and a richer mix within the non value line of cards 
everyday cards unit volume was lower due to the soft economic conditions in the international greeting card businesses  particularly in the uk  while everyday unit volume was relatively flat in the north american businesses 
consistent with the trend seen throughout the year  selling prices improved compared to the prior year 
this price improvement was due primarily to our international business operations as the mix of cards sold shifted to higher priced cards

assuming all of the notes are exchanged  the net effect will be to use approximately million of cash to settle a portion of the total conversion value in our senior notes due on august  may be put back to us on august   at the option of the holders  at of the principal amount provided the holders exercise this option between july  and august  although we do not anticipate that contributions will be required in to the defined benefit pension plan that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of gibson greetings  inc in  we may make contributions in excess of the legally required minimum contribution level 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations evidenced by such events as bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings  a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably expect will be collected 
in addition  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs and current economic conditions 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although we consider these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which we operate could have a material effect on the required reserve balances 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized  but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we complete the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
to test for goodwill impairment  we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units 
while we use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing  our primary methods are discounted cash flows and a market based analysis 
we estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using 
table of contents estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
we also engage an independent valuation firm to assist with the fair value determination 
changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
deferred costs in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
we view such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with our retail customers 
the customer typically receives a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned as product is purchased from us over the stated time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify us as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  we subject such customers to our normal credit review 
we maintain a general reserve for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where we are aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  we record a specific reserve to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of its future value based upon expected performance 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
for contractual arrangements that are based upon a minimum purchase volume commitment  we periodically review the progress toward the volume commitment and estimate future sales expectations for each customer 
factors that can affect our estimate include store door openings and closings  retail industry consolidation  amendments to the agreements  consumer shopping trends  addition or deletion of participating products and product productivity 
based upon our review  we may modify the remaining amortization periods of individual agreements to reflect the changes in the estimates for the attainment of the minimum volume commitment in order to align amortization expense with the periods benefited 
we do not make retroactive expense adjustments to prior fiscal years as amounts  if any  have historically not been material 
the aggregate average remaining life of our contract base is years 
the accuracy of our assessments of the performance related value of a deferred cost asset related to a particular agreement and of the estimated time period of the completion of a volume commitment is based upon our ability to accurately predict certain key variables such as product demand at retail  product pricing  customer viability and other economic factors 
predicting these key variables involves uncertainty about future events  however  the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning 
if the deferred cost assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to not be recoverable through performance  such assets are written down as appropriate 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
the assumptions used in this assessment are consistent with our internal planning 
a valuation allowance is recorded against those deferred tax assets determined to not be realizable based on our assessment 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or decreased in the future if our assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies change 

table of contents sales returns we provide for estimated returns of seasonal cards in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical sales returns  the amount of current year seasonal sales and other known factors 
estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience 
however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and or its market 
we regularly monitor our actual performance to estimated rates and the adjustments attributable to any changes have historically not been material 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs 
the statement requires such costs to be treated as a current period expense 
sfas also establishes the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
any unallocated overhead would be treated as a current period expense in the period incurred 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after july  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement was originally effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission amended the compliance date of sfas r through an amendment of regulation s x 
the new effective date for us is march  we expect the adoption of fas r to reduce consolidated net income by an amount approximating the pro forma expense disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  to clarify the proper accounting for rental costs incurred on building or ground operating leases during a construction period

factors that may affect future results certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use such words as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available information  but are subject to a variety of uncertainties  unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment  which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements  and that could adversely affect our future financial performance  include  but are not limited to  the following the timing and impact of the changes that we plan to make to our capital structure  including the ability to successfully exchange our existing convertible subordinated notes for new convertible 
table of contents subordinated notes  repurchase our senior notes  or raise additional financing on terms favorable to us by issuing senior notes  the timing and impact of investments in new retail or product strategies as well as new product introductions and achieving the desired benefits from those investments  the ability to execute share repurchase programs or the ability to achieve the desired accretive effect from such repurchases  retail bankruptcies  consolidations and acquisitions  including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms  a weak retail environment  consumer acceptance of products as priced and marketed  the impact of technology on core product sales  competitive terms of sale offered to customers  successful implementation of supply chain improvements and achievement of projected cost savings from those improvements  increases in the cost of material  energy and other production costs  our ability to comply with our debt covenants  fluctuations in the value of currencies in major areas where we operate  including the us dollar  euro  us pound sterling  and canadian dollar  escalation in the cost of providing employee health care  successful integration of acquisitions  and the outcome of any legal claims known or unknown 
risks pertaining specifically to ag interactive include the viability of online advertising  subscriptions as revenue generators and the public s acceptance of online greetings and other social expression products and the ability of the mobile division to compete effectively in the wireless content aggregation market 
the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us 
should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our financial performance related to forward looking statements  refer to the risk factors section included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments during the periods presented  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate exposure we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
currently  the majority of our debt is carried at fixed interest rates 
therefore  our overall interest rate exposure risk is minimal 
based on our interest rate exposure on our non fixed rate debt as of and during the year ended february   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
under the terms of our new credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow significantly more floating rate debt  which  if incurred could have a material impact on interest expense in a fluctuating interest rate environment 

table of contents foreign currency exposure our international operations expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of international subsidiaries to us dollars could affect comparability of results between years 
approximately  and of our  and net sales from continuing operations  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
operations in australasia  canada  mexico  south africa  the european union and the united kingdom are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
no assurance can be given that future results will not be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates
