item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of the company s consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview the company experienced significant growth in revenues and profitability during much of this growth came from three significant transactions consummated during the third quarter of the acquisition of compressco  inc compressco  the purchase of the kemira calcium chloride assets which make up the company s tce operations  and the purchase of the arapaho derrick barge 
in addition  increased demand for many of the company s products and services resulted in increased pricing and sales volumes  and higher utilization of equipment 
consolidated revenues increased during compared to and consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from during to during demand for the company s products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which is significantly affected by the level of capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
industry expenditures for drilling  as indicated by onshore rig count statistics  have risen during the past four years and reflect the industry s response to higher crude oil and natural gas pricing during this period 
the company expects that such increased industry spending levels will continue during over the longer term  the company believes that there will continue to be growth opportunities for the company s products and services in both the us and international markets  supported primarily by increases in technologically driven deepwater gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  continued reservoir depletion in the us  advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad  and storm damage to offshore production facilities in the gulf of mexico 
the company continues to grow its businesses to capitalize on the current market environment for the industry 
during  the company significantly expanded the operations of its maritech resources  inc maritech subsidiary with three acquisitions of producing properties 
in february  the company acquired an additional heavy lift barge  the db  and leased the anna iv derrick barge under extendable terms  in order to increase the company s capacity to serve the growing gulf of mexico decommissioning market 
in march  the company acquired the assets and operations of epic divers  inc and associated affiliate companies epic  a full service diving operation  to diversify the service offerings and enhance the efficiency of the wa d division 
also  in march  the company consummated the acquisition of beacon resources  llc beacon  a domestic production testing operation 
the company has also planned significant capital expenditure activity during  including the initial phases of a project to develop its magnolia  arkansas brine reserves  the construction of a bromine plant and a calcium chloride plant  and the expansion of its existing west memphis  arkansas bromine facility 
during the third quarter of  hurricanes katrina and rita affected several of the company s operations in the us gulf of mexico region and damaged certain of its fluids facilities  and certain of its decommissioning assets  including one of its heavy lift barges 
maritech suffered varying levels of damage to a majority of its offshore oil and gas producing platforms  and three of its platforms were completely destroyed 
the storms also caused the majority of maritech properties to be shut in for several weeks  postponing the initial impact on earnings from the third quarter acquisitions 
production from certain maritech properties continues to be suspended as a result of the hurricanes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company performed repair efforts on certain of the damaged assets  however  the company is continuing to assess the extent of damages  particularly to the destroyed maritech platforms 
while it is still difficult to accurately predict the total amount of damage  the company s best estimate is that total company wide repair costs  including the cost to repair fluids and well abandonment facilities and equipment  abandon damaged offshore wells and decommission or repair damaged platforms  will range between to million 
the majority of these costs are expected to be incurred in and  with some costs likely to also be incurred in later years 
as the company gathers additional information  this range of total repair costs could change in the future 
the company s insurance protection is expected to cover substantially all of the damages incurred  and repair costs incurred up to the amount of deductibles were charged to earnings during as of december   repair expenditures incurred in excess of such deductibles and covered by insurance protection totaled approximately million and are included in accounts receivable 
the company anticipates that its future insurance coverage premiums will significantly increase as a result of the recent storms 
the company s fluids division is a world leader in oil and gas completion fluids and generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling completion fluids and providing filtration and associated products and engineering services to domestic and international exploration and production companies worldwide 
the demand for the company s products and services is particularly affected by drilling activity in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or decreased during the past several years due to the maturity of a majority of gulf of mexico producing fields 
the average gulf of mexico rig count decreased in to rigs  compared to the prior year average of somewhat offsetting this impact is the current industry trend for drilling deeper offshore gas prospects that generally require higher volumes and precisely engineered brine solutions 
the fluids division also markets certain liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
with the addition of the tce operations acquired during  the company has expanded its calcium chloride manufacturing and distribution operations into european markets  and further reduced the division s dependence on the gulf of mexico 
fluids division revenues increased during  compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact from the acquisition of the tce operations  but also due to increased domestic sales volumes and prices 
further growth by the fluids division is predicated on the availability of selected raw materials at acceptable cost levels  and the ability of the company to pass along the increased cost for such materials to its customers through increased product prices 
the wa d division consists of two operating segments the wa d services and maritech segments 
wa d services generates revenues and cash flows by performing well plug and abandonment  pipeline and platform decommissioning and removal and site clearance services for oil and gas companies 
in addition  the segment provides electric wireline  workover  engineering and drilling services 
in march  the segment added the operations of a full service diving operation with the acquisition of epic 
the segment s services are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us including onshore  offshore and in inland waters 
wa d services revenues increased by during  despite interruptions due to the hurricanes  primarily due to increased platform decommissioning services performed during the year 
long term gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by mms regulations and the age of producing fields and production platforms and structures 
in the shorter term  activity levels are driven by oil and gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
given the significant damage incurred by many offshore operators as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita during  a new driver for the wa d services businesses is the repair work required by the offshore industry following these storms  and the escalation of existing work due to the risks posed by future storms  and the associated increased insurance costs associated with offshore platforms and properties 
the march acquisition of epic  as well as the february purchase of an additional heavy lift derrick barge  increases the wa d services segment s capacity to participate in the current post hurricane market 
the maritech segment acquires  manages and exploits producing oil and gas properties and generates revenues and cash flows from the sale of the associated oil and natural gas production volumes 
through maritech  the wa d division provides oil and gas companies with alternative ways of managing their well abandonment obligations  while effectively baseloading well abandonment and decommissioning work for the wa d services segment of the division 
during  maritech and its subsidiaries consummated three significant acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties  more than doubling its oil and gas reserve volumes at december  compared to the prior year 
these acquisitions also significantly increased the backlog of wa d services to be performed on maritech operated properties compared to the prior year 
maritech s revenues during increased compared to  primarily due to higher commodity prices 
the full revenue and cash flow impact from the oil and gas property acquisitions was largely postponed  however  due to the impact of hurricanes during the third quarter of  which caused several of maritech s properties to be shut in for an extended period awaiting repairs of associated platforms  pipelines and other facilities 
the company anticipates that revenues and cash flows from the maritech segment will increase significantly during  reflecting substantially increased oil and gas production volumes and the continuing high oil and gas commodity prices which are expected during the year 
the production enhancement division generates revenues and cash flows by performing flowback pressure and volume testing and providing low pressure wellhead compression equipment and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary testing markets served are texas  louisiana  offshore gulf of mexico  mexico  brazil and venezuela 
following the march acquisition of beacon  the division has expanded its production testing market to include western texas and eastern new mexico 
compressco  the division s wellhead compression operation  markets its equipment and services principally in the mid continent  mid western  rocky mountain  texas and louisiana regions of the united states as well as in western canada and mexico 
the production enhancement division also provides the technology and services required for separation and recycling of oily residuals generated from petroleum refining to oil refineries in the united states 
the division s operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil  and the resulting increases in industry drilling and completion activities  in the domestic and international markets which the division serves 
production enhancement division revenues increased primarily due to the full year inclusion of compressco  which was acquired in july the company anticipates increased revenues and cash flows from the division during  reflecting the acquisition of beacon as well as the increased industry activity levels by customers in its markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectibility of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations which we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and with changes in our operating environment 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
goodwill is assessed for potential impairment at least annually 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field  and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of proved reserves 
maritech s oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
maritech purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
the acquired oil and gas producing properties are recorded at a cost equal to the estimated fair value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  adjusted by the amount of any cash or other consideration received or paid 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred  compared to the estimated amounts recorded  will affect our anticipated profitability 
decommissioning liabilities we estimate the third party market values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms and clear the sites  and use these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amount to be paid by the previous owners of the property referred to as decommissioning liabilities 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any profit earned by us in performing such abandonment and decommissioning operations on maritech s properties is recorded as the work is performed 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual costs of the work performed is recorded as additional profit on the project and included in earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which  in turn  would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects from billings under contracts  which are typically of short duration  that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies 
if  due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
acquisition purchase price allocations the accounting for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and in many cases such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report

consolidated gross profit during also increased significantly from the prior year  from million during to million during the current year  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit as a percent of revenues was during  compared to during the prior year 
general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses were million during  an increase of million or  compared to the increase was primarily due to the overall growth of the company  with a large portion of the increase attributable to the addition of the compressco and tce operations  which were acquired during the third quarter of the increased general and administrative expenses included approximately million of increased salaries  incentives  benefits and other associated employee expenses  approximately million of higher professional service expenses  approximately million of increased office expenses  approximately million of increased bad debt expense  and approximately million of other general expense increases 
due to the significant increase in the company s operating revenues  however  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to during  compared to during the prior year 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during  compared to million of income during the prior year period  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to approximately million of increased net gains on sales of assets  approximately million of increased equity in the earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures and approximately million of increased foreign currency gains 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense was million during  primarily due to significant borrowings of long term debt used to fund a portion of the company s acquisitions during the third quarter of during the first half of  the company had no long term debt balances outstanding other than minimal amounts related to capitalized leases 
in addition  the company increased its long term debt borrowings by approximately million during  as borrowings related to the closing of a maritech oil and gas property acquisition during the third quarter of and other working capital needs during the fourth quarter of more than offset the approximately million of debt repayments during the year 
during the first quarter of  the company borrowed additional amounts under its bank credit facility to fund certain acquisition and purchase transactions 
interest expense is expected to increase to the extent such borrowings remain outstanding 
the company s provision for income taxes during increased to million  compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to increased earnings 
net income income before discontinued operations was million during  compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
net income was million during  compared to million during the prior year 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased significantly  from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
the impact from including a full year of operations of tce  which was acquired in september  resulted in approximately million of this increase 
increased product pricing  sales volumes and service activity generated an additional increase of approximately million in revenue 
in october  one of the division s main raw material suppliers announced that it had permanently ceased production from its tdi plant in lake charles  louisiana 
this plant supplied feedstock to the division s lake charles calcium chloride manufacturing facility  which generated approximately of the division s revenues during the division is operating its lake charles facility at a reduced level for an indefinite period while it reviews alternative sources of raw materials  and calcium chloride revenues could be decreased during this period 
fluids division gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from during to during such increases were primarily due to increased product sales volumes  a more favorable mix of higher margin products and services  and increased prices during the period  which offset the impact of higher product costs 
in addition  the inclusion of the tce operations for the full year contributed an increase of approximately million 
given the increased cost of raw materials for its products  and the potential higher cost of alternative feedstock supply for the division s lake charles manufacturing facility  future levels of gross profit for the fluids division will be impacted by the division s ability to pass along these increased costs to its customers through higher product prices 
fluids division income before taxes during increased by million  totaling million  compared to million during  an increase of 
this increase was generated by the million increase in gross profit discussed above  approximately million of gain from disposal of certain international assets  approximately million of increased foreign currency gains  and million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative expenses  including a full year of administrative expenses of tce 
wa d division wa d division revenues increased to million during  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
the division s wa d services operations revenues increased by approximately million  from million during to million during  an increase of approximately 
this increase was primarily due to the increased activity of the division s well abandonment and decommissioning operations  particularly in the gulf of mexico and inland waters region 
the division s decommissioning operations were able to capitalize on the increased activity levels following the purchase of the arapaho  an ton heavy lift barge  during as a result of the hurricane damage experienced by many offshore operators during the third quarter of  the division anticipates increased demand for its services  as operators repair or decommission damaged platforms or escalate their abandonment and decommissioning plans due to the risk of future storms and the associated increasing insurance costs 
to increase its capacity to provide services  the division purchased another derrick barge in february  the db  made extensive repairs and modifications to one of its existing vessels  and entered into an arrangement to lease an additional vessel  the anna iv 
in march  the division acquired epic  a full service diving operation  in order to provide additional services to its customers and to secure a substantial portion of the supply of such services for wa d services operations 
the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to approximately million from higher realized oil and gas sales prices compared to the prior year period  a million increase from increased production volumes primarily due to acquisitions of producing properties and a million increase from prospect fee revenue recorded during during the third quarter of  maritech and its subsidiaries consummated three significant acquisitions of producing properties 
beginning in the last half of the third quarter of  production from a majority of maritech s producing properties  including its newly acquired properties  was shut in as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
while the majority of maritech s properties resumed production during the fourth quarter of  much of the potential increased revenue impact from the acquisitions was postponed as a result of the storm interruptions 
as of march   a portion of maritech s daily production remains shut in  primarily relating to production which is processed through neighboring platforms  pipelines and processing facilities of other operators and third parties 
while the company anticipates that the majority of these shut in properties will resume production during  the full resumption of maritech s production levels depends on the damage assessments and repairs of certain of these third party assets  the timing of which is outside of maritech s control 
even with this delay  however  the division anticipates that revenues for the maritech operations will increase in the future as a result of the acquisitions  successful exploitation efforts  and increased oil and gas sales prices  a portion of which have been hedged through wa d division gross profit during totaled million  an increase of million  or  compared to million during wa d services gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million 
wa d services gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to compared to during these increases were due to operating efficiencies generated from the higher equipment and crew utilization as a result of the increased demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services in the offshore and inland water region 
the division s increased vessel fleet and the newly acquired epic diving operations are expected to provide additional efficiencies in the future as the division attempts to capitalize on the current market demand for its services 
the division s maritech operations reported gross profit of million during  compared to million during  a million decrease 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased during to  compared to during increased commodity prices were more than offset by approximately million of increased operating expenses  and an impairment charge of approximately million during the increased operating expenses were primarily due to the recent producing property acquisitions and include an increase from the associated depreciation  depletion and accretion costs 
as a result of the timing of these acquisitions  such increased operating expenses were incurred during the last four months of  when a significant portion of maritech s production was shut in following the hurricanes 
maritech suffered varying levels of damage to the majority of its offshore production platforms  and three of its platforms were completely destroyed 
the division is currently assessing the extent of these damages  particularly with regard to the destroyed platforms  and expects to incur significant costs during and beyond to repair these assets 
substantially all of these damaged assets are covered under the company s various insurance policies  the cost of which is expected to significantly increase beginning in wa d division income before taxes was million during compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
wa d services income before taxes increased from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit described above  partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative expenses  primarily from increased employee and workers compensation liability related expenses 
the division s maritech operations reported income before taxes of million  compared to million during  a million decrease  or 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit discussed above  and due to approximately million of increased administrative costs related to the growth of maritech s operations 
such decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased gains from sales of properties 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased during compared to  from million during to million during  an increase of million 
approximately million of this increase was due to the inclusion of compressco s operations for the full year 
compressco was acquired during the third quarter of in addition  the division s domestic and international production testing operations revenues increased by approximately million during  due to increased activity from certain of its customers and the recent extension of such services into brazil 
the division s process services operations provided an additional million increase 
the division s march acquisition of beacon is expected to enable the division to expand its domestic production testing operations into the western texas and eastern new mexico markets 
production enhancement division gross profit totaled million during  increasing from million during  a million increase  or 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased from during to in increased gross profit and gross profit percentage were due mainly to the acquisition of compressco  and to a lesser extent  was due to the increased activity in the production testing business 
income before taxes for the production enhancement division increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the million increase in gross profit discussed above  less approximately million of increased administrative costs  primarily related to administrative costs associated with compressco 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s operating divisions  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million during to million during  an increase of million 
this increase was due to increased administrative costs and net interest expense 
the company recorded an increase in interest expense of approximately million related to the outstanding balance of long term debt that was outstanding during all of the company utilized long term borrowings during the third quarter of to fund acquisitions 
administrative costs increased approximately million due to approximately million of increased salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and other employee related expenses  approximately million of increased audit and professional service expenses  approximately million of increased office expenses  and approximately million of increased other general expenses 
compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million during  an increase of  largely due to the acquisitions made during consolidated gross profit increased  from million during to million during  also largely due to the acquisitions 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during  compared to during general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase was reflective of the overall growth in the company s operations due to acquisitions and primarily consists of approximately million of salary  incentive and employee benefit cost increases  million of increased professional fees primarily for corporate compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act  plus approximately million of increased insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to during  versus during interest expense and income taxes during  the company recorded million of net interest expense  compared to million of net interest expense during  primarily due to the significant increase in the outstanding balances of long term debt beginning in the third quarter of such borrowings  which were used to fund the acquisitions of compressco  the kemira calcium chloride assets  and a heavy lift barge during the third quarter of  consisted of borrowings under the company s line of credit facility and from the issuance of debt in a private debt offering 
the provision for income taxes was million in  a decrease of million  primarily as a result of decreased earnings compared to the effective tax rate for the year decreased to during compared to in  due primarily to an increase in income from existing international operations as well as the operations from the newly acquired kemira calcium chloride assets during the third quarter of net income income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million during  compared to million during  a decrease of 
income per diluted share before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was on  average diluted shares outstanding during  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding during discontinued operations during consisted of the norwegian process services operations 
during  discontinued operations also included the operations of damp rid  inc  which was sold in september the company recorded a gain of million from the sale of damp rid  net of taxes of million  and a loss of million for the asset impairment related to the future disposal of the norwegian process services facility  net of a million tax benefit 
in july  the financial accounting standards board released sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as part of the carrying value of the asset when the obligation is incurred 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  prior to  the company expensed the costs of retiring its non oil and gas properties at the time of retirement 
in addition  prior to the company recorded the retirement obligations associated with its oil and gas properties at an undiscounted fair market value 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
was to record a charge of million per diluted share  net of taxes of million  during the first quarter of  to expense the costs of retirement obligations associated with the company s existing long lived assets and to accrete the liability to its present value as of january  net income was million during  compared to million during net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding during divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased million  or  during compared to  totaling million during this increase was due to increased market share for certain of the division s products and services  despite the impact of reduced gulf of mexico drilling activity 
a portion of this market share increase was due to the september acquisition of the kemira calcium chloride assets  which generated revenues during the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
fluids division gross profit during increased by million  or  compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from during to during the increased market share for certain of the division s products  including the impact of the acquisition mentioned above  generated approximately million of increased gross profit 
this increased gross profit was partially offset by the impact of decreased prices and increased net costs for certain of the division s products  including feedstocks  transportation and utilities  which decreased gross profit by approximately million 
fluids division income before taxes during totaled million  compared to million during  an increase of million or  as the million increase in gross margin discussed above was partially offset by increased administrative expenses 
wa d division the wa d division generated revenues of million during  compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
the division s wa d services operations reported revenues of million  decreasing million from revenues of million 
million of wa d services revenues during were related to services performed for maritech 
the decrease in wa d services revenues was primarily due to reduced overall abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico  and despite a million increase in wireline and onshore well abandonment revenues 
much of the gulf of mexico abandonment and decommissioning activity was postponed by many wa d division customers  including maritech  due to strong commodity prices and property sales during in addition  storm activity in the gulf of mexico during caused increased delays in well abandonment and decommissioning activity compared to the prior year 
the division s success in bidding for such services can also fluctuate from year to year  given the substantial competition for its services in the gulf of mexico 
well abandonment and decommissioning revenues during the fourth quarter of did increase compared to the prior year quarter  partially due to the division s september purchase of a heavy lift barge 
the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during  an increase of million compared to  as an increase in realized commodity prices generated million of additional revenues and increased production volumes generated million of increased revenues 
these production volume increases were due to producing property acquisitions and exploitation efforts  and more than offset normal production declines 
maritech suffered storm damage to one of its offshore production platforms during hurricane ivan  causing one of its producing properties to remain shut in 
wa d division gross profit decreased million  or  to million during from million during wa d services gross profit totaled million during compared to million during gross profit as a percentage of revenues was during compared to during the long term drivers for the well abandonment operations are primarily mms regulations  the overall maturity of gulf of mexico fields  and the age of the platforms and structures in the gulf 
however  the impact of short term factors discussed above caused a decrease in the wa d division s gulf of mexico well abandonment and decommissioning activity levels during and contributed to a reduction in equipment and personnel utilization  resulting in decreased gross profit of approximately million for the wa d services operations 
the wa d division s maritech operation s gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was during compared to in maritech generated million of additional gross profit from increased commodity prices and million from higher production volumes due to property acquisitions and reserve volume increases 
these increases more than offset million of increased lease operating expenses  resulting from workover and exploitation projects conducted during the remaining net increase in maritech s gross profit of million is due to the difference in the amount of property impairments recorded in of million compared to million recorded in wa d division income before taxes totaled million during  a decrease of million  or  compared to wa d services decreased from million during to million during  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in wa d services gross profit described above  plus approximately million of additional administrative expenses during the year primarily from increased salaries and employer s liability insurance related expenses 
in addition  wa d services reflected a million gain on the sale of an asset during the division s maritech operations reported million of income before taxes  compared to million during this million increase was caused by the million increased gross profit plus million of increased gain on sales of assets during  less approximately million of increased administrative expenses due to the growth of maritech s operations 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased million  or  to million during  compared to million during this increase was primarily due to the july acquisition of compressco  which generated million of revenues during the last half of the year 
the division s production testing revenues were relatively flat compared to the prior year  despite increased industry activity  due to competitive pressures  the inactivity of a major domestic customer and contract interruptions in latin america during a portion of the year 
in addition  the company s process services operations generated a million increase in revenues due to higher processed volumes at certain of its contract locations 
the production enhancement division reported gross profit of million during compared to million during  a increase 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to during compared to during the addition of compressco  beginning in july  increased gross profit by million 
in addition  the process services operations generated million of added gross profit  primarily from increased efficiencies due to the higher volumes processed

in addition  the division s results reflected approximately million in additional gains during the prior year period from the sale of certain production testing equipment 
corporate overhead the company includes in corporate overhead general and administrative expense  depreciation and amortization  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s business segments  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million during to million during  primarily due to a million increase in administrative expenses  primarily from increased salaries and professional fee expenses associated with increased corporate compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  net interest expense increased million during  due to the increased long term borrowings beginning in the third quarter of  which were utilized to fund acquisitions during the period 
liquidity and capital resources over the past three years  the company has generated approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities  million of proceeds from asset sales and other investing activities  and million from financing activities  which it used to fund approximately million of capital expenditures and the purchase of million of business acquisitions 
during the year ended december   and in early  the company has continued to increase its asset base and execute its growth strategy 
the company s maritech subsidiary consummated significant acquisition transactions during  more than doubling its oil and gas reserves 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired epic and beacon and purchased a heavy lift barge for a total of approximately million of cash 
to fund this growth  the company utilized much of its available capital resources  which the company expanded in january by increasing the borrowing capacity under its bank credit facility from million to million 
the company s cash capital expenditures during totaled approximately million  and the company anticipates increased capital expenditure activity in to further grow its operations 
the company continues to generate increased operating cash flow from each of its operating divisions  which it plans to use to fund a majority of the anticipated capital expenditure activity 
cash flow in excess of the company s capital expenditures will be used principally to reduce the outstanding balance under its credit facility  which was approximately million as of march  after funding the acquisition of the heavy lift barge  beacon and epic 
the company has additional availability under its bank credit facility of approximately million as of march  the company could require additional capital in the near term to fund its capital expenditure plans 
the company believes it has various options to expand its capital resources should the need arise 
long term borrowings are not scheduled to mature until through operating activities the company continued to generate positive operating cash flow from each of its three operating divisions  resulting in total cash provided by operating activities of million during  compared to million during accounts receivable increased during  reflecting the impact from higher prices  activity and product sales volumes in addition to amounts receivable pursuant to insured hurricane repair costs 
this increase was largely offset by increased payables and accrued expenses during the year 
operating cash flow was reduced  however  by the increased volumes and cost of product inventory during the year  and such cost increases are expected to continue during the company anticipates that the recent acquisitions of epic and beacon and the purchase of the additional heavy lift derrick barge will contribute additional operating cash flow beginning in future operating cash flow is also largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas industry activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico region of the us the company s increased revenues and operating cash flows during reflect the increased demand for the products and services of the majority of its businesses  and the company expects that such demand will continue to increase in the operating cash flow impact from this increased demand is limited or partially offset  however  by the increased product  operating and administrative costs required to deliver its products and services  and the company s equipment and personnel capacity constraints 
as a result of significant hurricanes during the third quarter of  the company suffered damage to certain of its fluids facilities and to certain of its decommissioning assets  including one of its heavy lift barges 
maritech suffered varying levels of damage to the majority of its offshore oil and gas producing platforms  and three of its platforms were completely destroyed 
maritech s operating cash flow was particularly affected  and several of its properties remain shut in awaiting platform  pipeline or other facilities to be repaired 
though the resumption of shut in production on these properties is largely outside of maritech s control  the company expects that the majority of these shut in properties will return to production during beginning in the third quarter of  the company began performing repair efforts on certain of the damaged assets  however the company is continuing to assess the extent of certain damage  particularly to the destroyed maritech platforms 
while it is still difficult to accurately predict the total amount of damage  the company s best estimate is that total repair costs  including the cost to repair fluids and well abandonment facilities and equipment  abandon damaged offshore wells  and decommission the destroyed platforms will range between to million 
the majority of these costs are expected to be incurred in and  with some additional costs likely to be incurred in later years 
the company s insurance protection is expected to cover substantially all of the property damage incurred 
however  for repair expenditures that are covered by insurance  the collection of insurance claims may be delayed  resulting in the temporary use of company capital resources to fund such repairs 
as of december   repair expenditures incurred in excess of deductibles and covered by insurance protection totaled approximately million and are included in accounts receivable  pending the processing of the company s insurance claims 
the company anticipates that its future insurance coverage premiums will significantly increase as a result of the recent storms  and that future coverage with similar deductible and maximum coverage amounts may not be available in the market  or its cost may not be justifiable 
future operating cash flow will also be affected by the commodity prices received for maritech s oil and gas production and the timing of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
following the third quarter acquisitions of additional producing properties  maritech entered into additional oil and gas commodity derivative transactions which extend through and are designed to hedge a portion of maritech s operating cash flows from risks associated with the fluctuating prices of oil and natural gas 
also  as a result of these acquisitions  the third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability increased significantly to million million undiscounted as of december  the cash outflow necessary to extinguish this liability is expected to occur over several years  shortly after the end of each property s productive life 
this timing is estimated based on the future oil and gas production cash flows as indicated by the company s oil and gas reserve estimates and  as such  is imprecise and subject to change due to changing commodity prices  revisions of these reserve estimates and other factors 
the company s decommissioning liability is net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases the previous owners are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  partially offsetting maritech s future obligation expenditures 
as of december   maritech s total undiscounted decommissioning obligation is approximately million  and consists of maritech s liability of million plus approximately million  which is contractually required to be reimbursed to maritech pursuant to such contractual arrangements with the previous owners 
investing activities during  the company expended approximately million of cash for capital expenditures  including approximately million of net cash for acquisitions of maritech oil and gas producing properties 
in february  the company expended approximately million for the purchase of a heavy lift derrick barge 
in march  the company paid approximately million at closing  subject to adjustment  for the acquisition of epic  which allows the wa d division to offer diving services to its customers 
in connection with the acquisition of epic  the company shall pay an additional million of consideration at a future date to be determined dependent on certain events 
also in march  the company paid approximately million for the acquisition of beacon  which will allow the company s production testing operation to expand into a new geographic market 
the beacon acquisition also contains a contingent consideration provision which  if satisfied  could result in up to million of additional consideration to be paid in march such transactions were funded by increased borrowings under the company s bank credit facility 
in addition to the above transactions  the company plans to expend an estimated million on additional capital additions during the significant majority of such planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand the company s existing businesses  and may be postponed or cancelled as conditions change 
projects planned during include the initial phase of the development of the company s magnolia  arkansas brine facility 
in addition to the above capital expenditure plans  the company may also consider suitable acquisitions or opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil and gas service markets 
to the extent the company consummates a significant transaction  the company s liquidity position will be affected 
the company expects to fund the increased amount of capital expenditures in through cash flows from operations and from its bank credit facility 
should additional capital be required  the company believes that it has the ability to generate such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
total cash capital expenditures of approximately million during included approximately million by the wa d division  of which approximately million was for maritech acquisitions and approximately million was primarily related to exploitation and development expenditures on maritech s offshore oil and gas properties 
the production enhancement division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million related to compressco compressor fleet expansion  approximately million to replace and enhance a portion of the production testing equipment fleet  and approximately million for process services capital projects 
the fluids division reflected approximately million of capital expenditures  primarily related to plant expansion projects during the year 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million 
during  maritech purchased offshore oil and gas producing properties in three separate acquisition transactions in exchange for approximately million of net cash plus the assumption of approximately million  undiscounted  of associated decommissioning obligations 
the previous owners of the properties are contractually obligated to pay million of these acquired obligations as the abandonment and decommissioning work is performed 
these oil and gas producing assets were recorded at a cost equal to the cash consideration paid plus the discounted fair value of the net decommissioning liabilities assumed of million 
the company continues to pursue the purchase of additional producing oil and gas properties as part of its strategy to support its wa d division 
while future purchases of such properties are also expected to be primarily funded through the assumption of the associated decommissioning liabilities  the transactions may also involve the payment or receipt of cash at closing or the receipt of cash when associated well abandonment and decommissioning work is performed in the future

lease expiration occurs six months after the last producing well on the lease ceases production 
the company has estimated the timing of these payments based upon anticipated lease expiration dates  which are subject to many changing variables  including the estimated life of the producing oil and gas properties  which is affected by changing oil and gas commodity prices

in september  the company borrowed euros to fund the european calcium chloride asset acquisition from kemira 
the company entered into long term euro denominated borrowings  as it believes such borrowings provide a natural currency hedge for its euro based operating cash flow 
the company also has exposure related to operating receivables and payables denominated in euros as well as other currencies  however  such transactions are not pursuant to long term contract terms  and the amount of such foreign currency exposure is not determinable or considered material

the company s risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of its oil and gas production 
during the third quarter of  the company s maritech resources  inc subsidiary acquired additional oil and gas producing properties in three separate transactions 
given the increased oil and gas production volumes expected as a result of these acquisitions  the company entered into additional derivative financial instruments designed to hedge the price volatility associated with a portion of the increased production
