overview the trend in the aviation industry is toward digital cockpits as the industry moves away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was the foundation of the company 
the company has made considerable progress in developing electronic instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems to replace mechanical instrumentation that the company had previously offered to its customers 
the company is currently developing digital display instrumentation to further replace mechanical instrumentation in its product line to broaden its offering to customers who may want to upgrade their cockpits 
the company has increased its research and development expenditures to facilitate this upgrade in its product line as it anticipates further movement toward digital cockpits in the aviation industry  positioning itself in a market niche where it has the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation 
while the company believes that this strategy strengthens its position in the industry  it cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful 
an additional trend in the aviation industry is toward system integration by the oems 
while the company currently maintains direct relationships with oems  it anticipates that oem suppliers will need to align themselves with integrators in order to preserve its position on future aircraft platforms 
the company also has significant business tied to military programs 
as a consequence  the company s business can fluctuate depending on government spending on military programs for which the company supplies its products 
while the company has been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  changes in government spending could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future military business 
likewise  changes in the commercial sector of the aviation industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future business 
while the company has invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase the company s revenue in the industry 
as the company endeavors to increase its international presence  its exposure to international economic changes as well as foreign currency risk may increase 
while the company may manage this exposure with appropriate resources  it cannot guarantee that such risks will be fully mitigated 
results of operations revenues revenues increased  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for fiscal year this increase was largely driven by shipments of imfps  particularly the initiation of imfp shipments to korean aerospace 
in addition  volume for core instrument revenues increased approximately  and recognition of revenue for the joint strike fighter jsf development program increased approximately  revenues decreased  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for fiscal year this decrease was largely driven by a decrease in revenue of approximately  for the jsf development program that resulted from slower progress on completing and testing the probe design 
precision components revenue decreased approximately  as the phase out of that business was completed 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by increases in volume for core instrument revenues of approximately  and price changes of approximately  as the company achieved further market penetration for recently introduced products and negotiated more favorable terms 
cost of sales cost of sales increased  or  to  or of revenues  for fiscal year from  or of revenues  for fiscal year this increase in cost was primarily due to higher revenues  while increases in manufacturing efficiencies yielded greater throughput that reduced overall costs as a percentage of revenues 
however  margins on the jsf development program were negative  as the rate of growth in jsf program costs incurred exceeded the rate of growth in revenues recognized  partially offsetting the effect of increased manufacturing throughput 
cost of sales increased  or  to  or of revenues  for fiscal year from  or of revenues  for fiscal year this increase in cost was primarily due to lower margins on the jsf development program  as the rate of growth in jsf program costs incurred exceeded the rate of growth in revenues recognized 
in addition  further discussions and negotiations with the jsf program s customer in january resulted in the definition of additional design work and testing to continue with progress on the probe design 
additional design work  testing and modifications to the products being developed for the jsf project have resulted in further changes to the company s estimate at completion for the project 
the company now estimates that the jsf project will result in an overall loss of approximately  at completion 
the company has recognized the losses throughout the program as revisions to the estimate were identified 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  or  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in research and development costs as the transition of projects from outside contractors to internal engineering staff was completed early in fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales commissions due to a substantial increase in sales to customers in asia 
sg a expenses decreased  or  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue for fiscal year the decrease was attributable to substantial reductions in one time charges for professional fees that were partially offset by the company s investment at clearwater instruments of approximately  in product development for the cessna mustang program and the expansion of its engineering capability  increases in corporate governance related expenses of approximately  as well as increases in travel of approximately  for international business development 
interest expense net interest expense increased  or  to  in fiscal year from net interest expense of  in fiscal year the net interest expense increase was due to higher average interest rates during the year  offsetting the benefit of lower average outstanding debt as well as interest income earned on accumulated excess cash 
net interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal year from net interest expense of  in fiscal year the net interest expense decrease was due to lower average outstanding debt during the year 
other income expense other income expense decreased  to  in fiscal year from other income expense of  in fiscal year miscellaneous income in fiscal year was primarily provided by foreign exchange gains on british pound denominated transactions 
the decrease in miscellaneous income from the prior year was due to the non recurrence of substantial one time items that are identified in the following paragraph 
other income expense increased  to  in fiscal year from other income expense of  in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the receipt of an insurance settlement of approximately  in may related to the june fire in the machine shop at the company s clearwater instruments location as well as the receipt of net proceeds of approximately  related to the sale of the company s engine vibration monitoring system evms product line inventory in february the sales price of the evms product line was approximately  and the costs related to this sale included inventory that was sold of approximately  inventory that was made obsolete by the sale of approximately  and legal fees of approximately  the increases in other income  net were partially offset by the recognition of a liability of approximately  related to the anticipated settlement of the company s class action litigation 
income tax expense income tax expense was a benefit of  for fiscal year as compared to a benefit of  for fiscal year the effective tax benefit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a substantial increase in operating income when compared to the tax effect of the lower level of operating income in fiscal year as well as the impact of the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance recognized in fiscal year however  the company has recognized extraterritorial income tax benefits of approximately  in fiscal year derived from non us sales activity for the fiscal years ended january  through income tax expense was a benefit of  for fiscal year as compared to a benefit of  for fiscal year the effective tax benefit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a substantial increase in income before taxes and a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal year when compared to the impact of the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance recognized in fiscal year the income tax obligations that arise from pretax income for fiscal year are offset by the change in the deferred tax allowance recognized in fiscal year as well as the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards 
although the company has recorded substantial deferred tax assets  the company anticipates that future earnings during the three fiscal years succeeding the fiscal year will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax benefits 
consequently  the company has reduced its deferred tax valuation allowance from approximately  as of january  to as of january  income net income increased  or to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue  for fiscal year earnings per share increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year net income increased  or to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue  for fiscal year earnings per share increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  the company cannot predict the future effects of inflation 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in progress billings to lockheed for the jsf development program as well as the receipt of federal income tax refunds for the fiscal year ended january  higher volume resulted in the use of cash to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories to sustain the increased activity level 
in addition  cash outflows for prepaid expenses increased as the company began utilizing its excess cash to pay its insurance premiums  discontinuing the practice of utilizing premium financing for this purpose 
cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal year the reduction was primarily attributable to a substantial year over year decrease in accounts payable as the company was able to bring its accounts to current status following a year of substantial one time expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by improvements in cash flows from net income net of deferred income tax effects of approximately  accounts receivable of approximately  and income taxes receivable and payable of approximately  cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year these expenditures were primarily made to sustain existing business activity 
cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to a machine tool purchase for production at avionics of approximately  that was offset by the proceeds from the sale of property of approximately  cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used of  in fiscal year this cash usage was entirely the result of paying down long term debt as scheduled 
cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used of  in fiscal year this reduction in cash usage was primarily due to repayments of a portion of the company s long term debt as well as the full repayment of previous drawdowns under the company s revolving credit facility 
to accommodate fluctuations in cash flow  the company has a million revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  na wachovia  which is set to expire in june although unused as of january   this revolving credit facility remains fully available for the company s short term financing needs 
the company intends to negotiate a new credit line with wachovia  and will endeavor to obtain terms and conditions that are at least equal to if not better than the existing terms and conditions 
however  the company cannot guarantee the outcome of these negotiations 
note to the financial statements provides details of the company s refinancing of its principal debt with wachovia on february  the wachovia refinancing 
the debt facilities provided by the wachovia refinancing consist of a  term loan  the aforementioned revolving credit facility and a  term loan 
the proceeds from the wachovia refinancing were used to repay all of the company s debt obligations to first commercial bank and suntrust bank na the repayment of the company s debt to first commercial bank and suntrust bank  na was at stated value  and therefore resulted in no gain or loss 
the company s long term debt agreements with wachovia contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including the requirement to maintain i at all times  a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that does not exceed to and ii at the end of each fiscal quarter  a cash flow coverage ratio with regard to the ratio of cash flow to the debt service of at least to 
the wachovia loan agreement subjects the company to a number of additional covenants that  among other things  require the company to obtain consent from the lender prior to making a material change of management  prior to making a guarantee of or otherwise becoming responsible for obligations of any other person or entity or assuming or becoming liable for any debt  contingent or direct  in excess of  the company is also required to provide wachovia with its interim quarterly financial statements within days of the close of each fiscal quarter and its annual financial statements within days of the close of each fiscal year 
as of january   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance with covenants in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results 
failure to achieve expected operating results and compliance with covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and operations in fiscal year and beyond  and could require implementation of further measures  including deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  and  if necessary  selling assets 
in addition  future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of products lines  and other factors 
management believes that cash and cash equivalents  together with the company s cash flow from operations and current borrowing arrangements  will provide for these necessary capital expenditures 
furthermore  the company may develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
as shown in the table below  as of january   there were liquidation payments that were due with respect to long term debt and other contractual obligations in fiscal year and beyond payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total one year years years years purchase commitments long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations the long term debt carries an interest obligation equal to the one month libor interest rate plus basis points 
as of january   the annualized amount of interest for the january  long term debt balance of approximately  would be approximately  the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results and renewing its credit line 
the company s credit facilities with wachovia  as discussed above  include a million credit line that is set to expire on june  failure to renew that line of credit or failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our operations in fiscal year  and could require us to consider further measures  including deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending and  if necessary  selling assets 
acquisitions currently  the company has no present arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions 
nevertheless  the company continues to monitor and evaluate acquisition opportunities 
the company s ability to consummate any acquisitions  including a merger with another entity  is substantially limited by covenants in the company s long term debt documents 
environmental matters in accordance with a consent agreement with the department of environmental protection signed by the company in  the company s environmental consultant developed an interim remedial action plan the remedial plan to contain and remediate certain soil and groundwater contamination that had been discovered at the company s clearwater  florida location 
the contamination was discovered after a series of site investigations that revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents and metalworking fluids as well as activities from neighboring property over a period of years or more 
although the exact cause of the contamination has never been ascertained  the company nonetheless accepted responsibility for remediating the pollutants that were discovered on its property 
during  the company recorded a provision of approximately  related to the estimated costs to be incurred under the remedial plan 
as of january   the company had utilized all amounts originally recorded in other accrued expenses  and the remediation phase of the remedial plan had been completed 
during the third quarter of  management determined the post remediation monitoring expense related to the environmental cleanup of would cost approximately  this amount was accrued and expensed during the third quarter of as of january   all existing reserve balances had been utilized 
based upon an assessment by the company s environmental consultants  the company s management has calculated the company s expected future expenditure for post remediation monitoring expense and has established a reserve of  for such expense as of january  the company is now in a monitoring only stage of the remediation where periodic measurements are taken by environmental consultants to determine the effectiveness of the remediation 
the existing reserve contemplates the remaining expected expenses  based upon advice from the company s environmental consultants  as of january  the following table is a recap of the financial impact of the company s environmental activities years ended january  beginning reserve balance costs incurred replenish reserve for costs incurred increase in estimate ending reserve balance critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and in item a 
risk factors 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies 
the company considers critical accounting policies to be those i that require the company to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on the company s financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following parag raphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company manufactures most of its products on a build to order basis and ships products upon completion 
the company has a policy of strict adherence to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab in order to accurately state its revenues in each accounting period 
for certain situations  some judgment is required  but most sales have clear revenue recognition criteria 
revenue sources for product sales are largely from sales to commercial and government customers 
the majority of customer sales terms are fob origin  although some customer terms are fob destination 
for those customers where terms are origin  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment  unless additional prevailing factors would not be in accordance with the revenue recognition requirements of sab for those customers whose terms are destination  revenue is generally not recognized until goods arrive at the customers premises and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company experiences a certain degree of sales returns that varies over time 
generally  such returns occur within no more than days after shipment by the company to its customers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas revenue recognition when right of return exists  the company is able to make a reasonable estimation of expected sales returns based upon history and as contemplated by the requirements of sfas for example  sales returns may occur if delivery schedules are changed by customers after products have shipped or if products are received by customers but do not meet specifications 
in such cases  customers may choose to return products to the company 
absent such circumstances  customers do not have a right to return products if the company has met all contractual obligations 
previously  the company had established a sales return reserve that app roximated an expected level of sales returns over a day period 
the company s experience with respect to sales returns for the fiscal years ended january  and has improved such that management believes it is no longer necessary to provide for a sales returns reserve 
from time to time  the company will jointly develop products with its customers for future applications 
in such circumstances  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for the contract 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
the percentage of completion contract costs include direct labor  material  subcontracting costs  test facilities  and other indirect costs as allocated 
other operating costs are charged to expense as incurred 
during fiscal  the company secured one long term fixed price contract for the development of instrumentation for the jsf program 
costs and estimated earnings on this contract as of january  and are as follows costs incurred to date estimated losses less billings to date costs and estimated losses in excess of billings in january  after further discussions with the company s customer for the jsf program that culminated in requirements for design changes in the multifunction probe that the company is designing for the jsf  the company has revised its estimate at completion for the jsf program 
the estimated costs of the project increased by approximately  and  as a result  estimated total program costs exceed estimated program revenues by approximately  the company recognized this loss in its financial statements for the fiscal year ended january  subsequent to the design changes  the company encountered many issues throughout the year related to testing and verification of the design change that resulted in increased expenditures for the program 
consequently  the company recognized additional losses in fiscal year as the likelihood of incurring those losses were iden tified 
the jsf program is a customer funded product development program that is presently expected to generate total project revenues of approximately  as of january   based on project progress  the company has recognized revenues of approximately  for the jsf project 
the jsf program represents a significant investment in the company s future product development capabilities 
while company management is expending considerable effort to control costs and complete the development process on schedule  the key benefit to the program is the substantial revenue that the company will earn if it is awarded the production contract for the jsf that is expected to follow the conclusion of the development program  which is presently expected to occur in mid occasionally the company enters into research and development contracts with customers 
the company accounts for such contracts on the basis of the lesser of non refundable cash versus percentage of completion 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses the company continuously evaluates its customers and provides reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
the company does maintain a limited reserve in anticipation that smaller accounts may become a collection issue  which occurs from time to time based on historical experience 
however  most of the company s customers are financially sound and the company s history of bad debts is relatively low 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financia l health of specific customers 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses and residual value losses the company values inventory at the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method or net realizable value 
reviews of inventory quantities on hand have been conducted to determine if usage or sales history supports maintaining inventory values at full cost or if it has instead become necessary to record a provision for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although the company endeavors to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and consequently reported operating results 
work in process inventories management employs certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
company practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory at its clearwater  florida  earlysville  virginia and wichita  kansas operations throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  management will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for the fiscal years ended january  and manufacturing overhead cost application the company establishes its inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating its overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed at least quarterly and is adjusted at least annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years management periodically evaluates long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and  management does not believe that any assets are impaired 
the company will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software and b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
other accounts affected by management estimates from time to time  management will utilize estimates when preparing the financial statements of the company 
such areas include amortization and other accruals 
the company has established a provision for warranty claims in anticipation of a certain degree of warranty activity  which generally is a minimal expense 
this provision is based upon recent warranty experience 
the company s warranty experience is as follows for the years ended january  beginning reserve balance costs incurred replenish reserve for costs incurred increase in estimate ending reserve balance the following table summarizes significant areas which require management estimates as of january  allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory warranty reserve environmental reserve reserve for sales returns deferred tax valuation allowance in addition to the items noted in the above table  management uses estimates in calculating the percentage of completion of the jsf program 
these estimates have a significant impact on costs and estimated losses in excess of billings included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management also uses estimates in the calculation of depreciation and amortization on its property  plant and equipment and loan costs 
the following table summarizes depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended january  depreciation amortization recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

the statement is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
fas focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the original pronouncement  issued in october  defined a fair value based method of accounting for share based payments  but permit ted companies to disclose such payments either employing the fair value based method of accounting or by using the intrinsic value method as defined by apb no

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
fas makes a distinction between restatements the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error and retrospective applications the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
the retrospective a pplication applies to voluntary changes in accounting principle by requiring retrospective application of the change throughout the periods reported instead of reporting the cumulative effect of the change  as previously prescribed by apb however  fas limits this treatment to only the direct effects of a change in accounting principle 
fas further defines that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
finally  fas establishes retrospective application as the transition method for new accounting principles  but only if the new accounting pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure for the company is interest rate risk 
the company s existing debt facilities require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus basis points 
consequently  the company has an exposure to fluctuations in the underlying interest rate for its debt facilities 
as an example  the prevailing rate for one month libor at january  was 
therefore  the company s borrowing cost under its existing debt facilities as of january  was 
for each million of borrowing at the january  one month libor interest rate  the company s annual interest cost would be  significant fluctuations in the underlying libor interest rate index could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
presently  the company does not utilize any financial instruments to manage this interest rate risk 
the company also has a market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company has a limited number of purchase and sale transactions that are denominated in british pounds 
the company s strategy in managing this risk exposure is to match the timing of british pound denominated cash inflows and outflows 
british pound denominated cash inflows generally exceed outflows  and the excess balance  if nominal  is maintained in a british pound denominated bank account 
substantial amounts of foreign currency are otherwise immediately converted to us dollars when received
