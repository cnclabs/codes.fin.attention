item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our selected five year financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this report 
cautionary statement for forward looking information certain information set forth in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  future revenues or performance  capital expenditures  financing needs  plans or intentions relating to potential acquisitions and other information that is not historical information 
when used in this report  the words estimates  expects  anticipates  forecasts  plans  intends  believes and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we may make additional forward looking statements from time to time 
all forward looking statements  whether written or oral and whether made by us or on our behalf  are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
we believe our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued monthly 
stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees and directors under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  instead of the fair value recognition provisions of the fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
under apb  no stock based employee compensation is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the company s plan have an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on the date of the grant 
the effect on net income if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
would have been a decrease of  for fiscal the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historic and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  weighted average expected option lives based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently does not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value 
in december  the fasb issued a sfas no 
r  share based payment  revision to sfas no 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for employee services and generally establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains goods or services in share based payment transactions 
we will adopt sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective application with no restatement of prior interim periods 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in  we do not expect to record any material compensation expense in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
on december   the company accelerated the vesting of all  unvested outstanding options 
had it not accelerated the vesting of these options  the company would have been required to record stock compensation expense of approximately  pre tax assuming no forfeitures in fiscal  due to the adoption of fas r 
in january  the fasb  issued fasb interpretation number  fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin fin addresses consolidation of variable interest entities  which are entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and for variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  finr  to clarify certain provisions and exempt certain entities from its requirements 
since we do not have any investments in variable interest entities  the adoption of fin and fin r did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations for additional information on our accounting policies  see footnote of the accompanying financial statements 
overview alpha pro tech is in the business of protecting people  products and environments

the line of paint with antimicrobials is designed to inhibit growth of bacteria  fungi and algae on the painted surfaces in hospitals  surgical rooms and cleanrooms and associated controlled environments 
in addition to our paint with antimicrobials  we have also developed a line of sealants with antimicrobials to be used for mold remediation 
the engineered products segment is expected to contribute significantly to revenue growth in this line of products is a natural extension of our core capabilities creating proprietary products designed to protect people and environments 
the house wrap offers a weather resistant barrier designed to lower energy consumption costs 
the proprietary synthetic roof underlayment is designed to resist the environment  as opposed to conventional roofing underlayment that is prone to rapid degradation and mold growth 
our products are classified into six groups disposable protective apparel  consisting of a complete line of shoecovers  bouffant caps  gowns  coveralls and lab coats  infection control products  consisting of a line of face masks and eye shields  extended care products  consisting of a line of medical bed pads  wheelchair covers  geriatric chair surfaces  operating room table surfaces and pediatric surfaces  a line of pet beds  construction weatherization products  consisting of house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment  and a line of paint with antimicrobials designed to inhibit growth of bacteria  fungi and algae on painted surfaces 
our products as classified above are grouped into four business segments 
the disposable protective apparel segment  consisting of disposable protective apparel  the infection control segment  consisting of face masks and eye shields  the extended care segment  consisting of extended care products  namely medical bed pads and pet beds  and the engineered products segment  consisting of construction weatherization products such as house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment as well as a line of antimicrobial paint

our pet beds are used by pet owners and veterinarians 
our products are distributed principally in the united states through a network consisting of purchasing groups  national distributors  local distributors  independent sales representatives and our own sales and marketing force 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two sales and marketing agreements for our line of construction supply weatherization products 
on january  we signed a year mutually exclusive agreement with perma r products  inc  perma r a grenada  mississippi based company 
as part of the agreement  perma r will be responsible for all marketing of our house wrap products and has agreed to minimum sales of million per year 
on february  we signed a second year  mutually exclusive agreement with perma r 
this second agreement stipulates that perma r will be responsible for all sales and marketing of our synthetic roof underlayment product and has agreed to minimum sales of million per year 
engineered products commenced sales of house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment during the first quarter of and revenue for this segment for the year ended december  was  this segment is expected to grow significantly in we are also focused on appreciably improving sales in the pharmaceutical  cleanroom and industrial safety markets 
our key sales growth strategies for these markets are based on a strategy of communicating directly with end users and developing innovative products to suit individual end users specific needs 
our disposable protective apparel segment that services these markets grew by for the year ended december  we expect sales in this segment to improve in results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations income before provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased sales of disposable protective apparel products of  to increased sales of construction supply weatherization products of  and increased infection control segment sales of  partially offset by decreased sales from our extended care unreal lambskin segment of  sales for the disposable protective apparel segment for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of the disposable protective apparel segment sales increase of  or was primarily due to increased sales of approximately million to our largest distributor  and an approximate million increase due to other distributors that concentrate on the cleanroom and industrial safety industries 
although this segment increased by in  we were trending significantly higher through the first nine months of this fourth quarter decline in growth was due to a decrease in shipments to our largest distributor during the last three months of although shipments declined in the fourth quarter of  shipments to the distributor s end users remained fairly consistent with prior quarters 
the decline in shipments to this distributor in the fourth quarter can be attributed to slowdown in orders from them to reduce their inventory levels  as well as sales to them in the fourth quarter of were stronger than normal 
orders from this distributor are expected to normalize during the latter part of the first quarter of we expect growth in the disposable protective apparel segment in as we will be introducing comfortech  a new material that we have been developing over the past two years and anticipate significant market share gains relative to the competition 
also  during the second quarter of we will be bringing to market comfortech certified  an entirely new class of products designed to dramatically decrease the risk of bioburden contamination in our target markets 
we anticipate continued long term growth in this segment

mask sales in this segment were very strong in the fourth quarter of as concerns about avian flu heightened 
mask sales in the fourth quarter were up as compared to the average for the first three quarters of we expect continued growth in this segment  especially sales of our n niosh approved respirator mask  if avian flu continues to be a worldwide concern 
we have significant manufacturing capacity for the n respirator mask in the event that demand surges

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we subcontract the manufacture of products in china and to a lesser extent in mexico and have a joint venture in india 
in addition the company s executive office  which employees people  is located in canada 
our results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to stronger economic conditions in those countries 
we believe we do not have a material foreign currency exposure due to the fact that our purchase agreements with companies in china  india and mexico are in us dollars 
in canada our foreign currency exposure is not material due to the fact that we do not manufacture in canada

we do not hedge our interest rate or foreign exchange risks
