overview angiodynamics is a provider of innovative medical devices used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease  or pvd 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad 
table of contents line of therapeutic and diagnostic devices that enable interventional physicians interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons and others to treat pvd and other non coronary diseases 
we believe that we are the only company whose primary focus is to offer a comprehensive product line for the interventional treatment of these diseases 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years dollars in thousands angiographic products dialysis products vascular access products venous products thrombolytic products pta products drainage products other total we sell our broad line of quality devices in the united states through a direct sales force comprised  as of july   of sales representatives  eight regional managers  an eastern and a western zone director  and a vice president of sales 
outside the united states  we sell our products indirectly through a network of distributors in markets 
for each of the last three fiscal years less than of our net sales were in non us markets 
our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
for fiscal  about of our net sales were from products introduced in the last five years 
for each of the past three fiscal years  we invested at least of our net sales in research and development 
research and development expenditures were of net sales for fiscal and we expect these expenditures to increase to of net sales by the end of and to remain at that level thereafter 
however  downturns in our business could cause us to reduce our research and development spending 
we are seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
although we completed a second offering of our common stock in fiscal  our cash resources remain somewhat limited and  except to the extent we can further use our equity securities as acquisition capital  we may require additional equity or debt financing to fund any significant acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify or complete any such acquisitions or that any required financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
consistent with our growth strategy  in october  we entered into a supply and distribution rights agreement with bioniche pharma group limited  subsequently amended in july  under which we obtained exclusive rights to market sotradecol for the treatment of varicose veins and other vascular indications in the united states 
we believe that sotradecol will become an important treatment method for small  uncomplicated varicose veins and its addition to our existing venous product portfolio gives us an opportunity to be a market leader in treatment methods for all varicose vein conditions 
for fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared to for fiscal we intend to continue to manufacture more of these products in house to achieve lower product costs and increased profitability 
in  we expanded our manufacturing facility to provide us with significantly greater manufacturing capacity and to accommodate additional research  
table of contents development and administrative requirements 
we are not currently operating our manufacturing facility at full capacity 
however  we anticipate requiring additional manufacturing  administrative and engineering space within the next one to two years 
our ability to further increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
through the effective date of our initial public offering  our primary sources of financing were loans and capital contributions from our former parent company  e z em  long term bank debt and cash generated from operations 
as we are no longer a subsidiary of e z em  we will not receive any further financing from e z em 
in addition  to preserve the tax free nature of our spin off from e z em we are  and until october   will be  subject to restrictions on our ability to raise capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  or to use our equity securities to acquire other businesses or assets 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectibility are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
for fiscal years   and  our write offs of accounts receivable aggregated  
table of contents income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of income 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of june   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately  and million  respectively 
we have a tax allocation and indemnification agreement with e z em with whom we have filed consolidated federal tax returns for periods through october  under this agreement  we paid federal income tax based on the amount of taxable income we generated and were credited for federal tax benefits we generated that were used by us or other members of the consolidated group 
this agreement does not cover tax liabilities arising from state  local and other taxing authorities to whom we report separately 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost on the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
as of june   may   and may   our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was   and  respectively 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis

table of contents for fiscal  our investing activities used net cash of million  due to four reasons 
we had a net investment of million of excess cash  consisting of a portion of the proceeds from our follow on public offering and cash generated from operations  into us government obligations  corporate securities and auction rate investments generally  long term municipal bonds that re price weekly 
installment payments for distribution rights under an exclusive supply and distribution agreement  together with costs to execute the agreement  totaled million 
we also acquired patent rights from a third party for  additionally  we made equipment purchases and building improvements totaling million  of which approximately million was for implementing and converting to a new enterprise resource planning system 
for fiscal and  capital expenditures were funded by cash provided by operations and cash reserves 
net capital expenditures were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
financing activities provided net cash of million for fiscal  due to receipt of million in net proceeds from our follow on public offering in may  and proceeds of million received from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
principal payments on our long term debt totaled  in fiscal  we financed an expansion of our headquarters and manufacturing facility with industrial revenue bonds for million 
to secure this financing  we entered into agreements with local municipalities  a bank  a trustee and a remarketing agent 
these agreements are referred to as the ida agreements 
the proceeds of the bonds were advanced as construction occurred 
the bonds reprice every seven days and are resold by a remarketing agent 
the bonds bear interest based on the market rate on the date the bonds are repriced and require quarterly principal payments ranging from  to  plus accrued interest through may we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank to convert the initial variable rate payments to a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the ida agreements contain financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage and interest coverage 
at june   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the outstanding debt is collateralized by a letter of credit million at june  and a first mortgage on the land  building and equipment comprising our facility in queensbury  and we are required to pay an annual fee ranging from to of the outstanding balance depending on our financial results 
the current fee is and is in effect until august  the debt covenants related to the industrial revenue bond financing and our bank line of credit  and the collateralization of substantially all of our assets to secure these financings  may restrict our ability to obtain debt financing in the future 
we are also restricted in our ability to obtain equity financing due to the distribution by e z em of our stock to its stockholders  which was completed on october  we are limited in the amount of equity securities or convertible debt we can issue generally in the two years following the stock distribution by e z em in order to preserve the tax free treatment of the distribution and avoid tax liabilities to e z em and its stockholders and corresponding liabilities to us 
specifically  we are limited to issuing no more than approximately million shares of our common stock in capital raising transactions through october  these factors could limit our sources of capital in the future 
on november   we replaced our million bank line of credit with a million line of credit facility with keybank national association  with a maturity date of november  the new line of credit carries the same annual facility fee as our previous agreement 
based on our financial strength  we were able to increase the amount of funds available to us at no additional expense 
the initial advance under the line of credit will bear interest at the rate of libor plus basis points the libor rate 
thereafter  the interest rate will be adjusted monthly at our election  to either the then current libor rate or the keybank prime rate 
accrued interest is payable monthly  and all outstanding principal amounts are payable at maturity  subject to a requirement to pay the outstanding principal balance and maintain a zero outstanding balance for at least one day period during the term of the line of credit 
all outstanding amounts under the line of credit are immediately due and payable upon any payment default or other default under the security agreement with the bank 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of june  
table of contents our contractual obligations as of june  are set forth in the table below 
we have no variable interest entities or other off balance sheet obligations 
cash payments due by period as of june  total less than one year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations notes payable to bank operating leases consulting contract the non cancelable leases and consulting contract are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances  cash generated from operations and our existing line of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for capital for at least the next months 
however  if we seek to make significant acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  we may require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r and related interpretations require that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have a material impact on our financial statements commencing with our first quarter of the fiscal year ending june  in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fas  to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not determined the impact on our financial statements of this interpretation at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into an interest rate swap with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change market risk on our variable interest rate financing  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may 
table of contents affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and debt securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
as of june   we were exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to our investments in callable us government corporation and agency obligations in the amount of  the bonds bear interest at a floating rate established weekly 
for fiscal  the after tax interest rate on the bonds approximated 
each basis point or fluctuation in interest rates will increase or decrease interest income on the bonds by approximately  on an annual basis 
at june   we maintained variable interest rate financing of million in connection with our facility expansion 
we have limited our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank under which we agreed to pay the bank a fixed annual interest rate of and the bank assumed our variable interest payment obligations under the financing 
on november   we entered into a  working capital line of credit with a bank 
the initial advance under the line of credit will bear interest at the rate of libor plus basis points the libor rate 
thereafter  the interest rate will be adjusted monthly  at our election  to either the then current libor rate or the bank s prime rate 
we will thus be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to this credit facility to the extent that interest rates rise when there are amounts outstanding under the facility
