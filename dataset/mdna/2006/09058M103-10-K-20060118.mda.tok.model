overview the business of bioanalytical systems  inc is dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotech companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is the direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work  and our products segment is the indirect beneficiary  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
developments within the industries we serve have a direct  and sometimes material  impact on our operations 
currently  many large pharmaceutical companies have major block buster drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections 
this puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market appeal  and to re evaluate their cost structures and the time to market of their products 
contract research organizations cro s have benefited from these developments  as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out sourcing to both reduce fixed costs  and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new drug applications 
the number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry 
that sector of the drug industry has seen significant growth in the past decade  and  we believe  will continue to experience strong growth in the foreseeable future 
generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for cro s as they develop  test and manufacture their generic compounds 
a significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by biotech and small  venture capital funded  drug development companies 
many of these companies are single molecule entities  whose success depends on one innovative compound 
while several of the biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceuticals  the industry is still characterized by smaller entities 
these developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of the clinical research within their organizations  and are therefore dependent on the cro industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their fda submissions 
these companies have provided significant new opportunities for the cro industry  including basi 
they do  however  provide challenges in selling  as they frequently have only one product in development  which causes cro s to be unable to develop a flow of projects from a single company 
these companies may expend all their available funds and cease operations prior to fully developing a product 
additionally  the funding of these companies is subject to investment market fluctuations  which change the risk profile and appetite of investors 
although the past year has not seen large mergers in either the pharmaceutical or cro industries  consolidation continues at a smaller pace in the cro sector 
we believe that consolidation of the cro sector will continue to be a factor in our markets 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are excellent to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our increasingly diverse operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to our capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods

this increase came from all domestic locations  as we had strong growth in our bioanalytical laboratories  our toxicology facility  and our clinical research unit 
our laboratory in the uk had a decline in revenues 
our revenues from products declined in the current year to million  a decline from last year s product revenues of million 
this decline was across our product line  following a particularly strong year in product sales in fiscal in the fiscal year ended september   we did not have any major new adopters of our culex system  whereas the prior fiscal year s sales had been strongly influenced by some major buying programs by our customers 
our sales of culex supplies  on the other hand  increased due to the larger installed base of culex users 
inflation in prices did not have a material impact on revenue increases 
costs of revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase of million was due to increases in the cost of service revenue as a result of the significant increase in the volume of our services business in fiscal  partially offset by a reduction in the cost of product revenue resulting from the the decrease in the number of products sold and a change in product mix 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenues decreased due to the higher utilization of capacity in our services segment 
a significant portion of our costs in our services segment are relatively fixed  which results in increasing margins as we increase our utilization of facilities 
costs of revenue for the company s products segment increased to as a percentage of product revenue for the year ended september  from of product revenue for the year ended september  this small change was the result of lower utilization of manufacturing capacity 
selling expenses for the year ended september  decreased by to million from million during the year ended september   due to decreased headcount in sales

in our west lafayette facility  we commissioned approximately  square feet of new research and laboratory space  causing approximately  of additional depreciation and other space related costs 
the remainder of the increase was related to compensation increases  increases in liability  property and health care coverages  and higher energy costs 
other income expense  net  was  in the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september   as a result of increased interest expense 
we reduced our average outstanding borrowings from the second fiscal quarter due to the sale of our baltimore building  but added million of capital leases to finance new laboratory equipment and had higher interest rates on our floating rate revolving credit facility 
the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal as a result of foreign taxable losses which reduced our pre tax income by approximately  without corresponding tax benefit 
the prior year s tax benefit was the result of a us loss which we could carry back against prior year s income  and foreign income for which foreign tax loss carryforwards were available 
as a result of the above  the company earned per share in fiscal  both basic and diluted  compared to a net loss fiscal of per share  both basic and diluted 
year ended september   compared with year ended september  total revenue for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  service revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the inclusion of two acquired businesses for the entire year in fiscal  compared to the inclusion from the date of acquisition in the prior year  caused a increase in the year to year revenues 
the other of revenue growth came from increased sales at all operating locations  except west lafayette research services  which had a decline 
these increases were the result of increased sales efforts in the baltimore and evansville locations  and improvement in our facilities from recent capital expenditures 
product revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to sales of the culex automated blood sampling system 
the increase in culex sales was a result of continuing acceptance of the technology by new customers  as well as strong re orders by existing customers 
inflation in prices did not have a material impact on sales increases 
costs of revenue increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  this increase of million was due to the inclusion of the acquired businesses mentioned in the revenue discussion and the costs of additional revenues 
cost of revenue as a percentage of service revenues increased due to the lower utilization of capacity of the acquired businesses costs of idle capacity are charged to cost of service revenue 
costs of revenue for the company s products segment decreased to as a percentage of product revenue for the year ended september  from of product revenue for the year ended september   as a result of product sales growth being driven by culex sales  which command higher margins than the company s older product lines 
selling expenses for the year ended september  decreased by to million from million during the year ended september   due to decreased headcount in sales 
research and development expenses  which are net of grant reimbursements  for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease of  is primarily due to reducing the number of research projects in the current year 
general and administrative expenses  for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september   as a result of the acquired business mentioned above 
the company also incurred  of non recurring consulting expenses necessitated by turnover in the company s finance department for the first six months of fiscal the company utilized a contract chief accounting officer and additional financial consultants to compensate for the resignation of both the chief financial officer and chief accounting officer 
other income expense  net  was  in the year ended september  as compared to  in the year ended september   as a result of the increase in interest expense from  to  due to increased borrowings for the acquisitions and additional construction of facilities  and a non recurring gain from sale of an excess facility of  in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was a benefit of for as a result of having a us taxable loss that can be carried back for refunds against prior years taxes  coupled with profitable operations in the united kingdom  where the company is utilizing loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the company has tax net operating loss carryforwards for its subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
such carryforwards  which have an indefinite life  are available to offset taxable income generated by those subsidiaries as provided by united kingdom tax regulations 
the prior year s tax rate was the result of taxable us income with a foreign loss generating no offsetting benefit 
as a result of the above  the company lost per share in fiscal  both basic and diluted  compared to net income in fiscal of per share  both basic and diluted

expenditures made in connection with the expansion of the company s operating facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana and in the united kingdom  physical plant improvements in baltimore  and purchase or upgrade of laboratory equipment account for the largest portions of these expenditures in prior years 
the decline in capital expenditures in fiscal is the result of the completion of expansion programs 
capital investments for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment are driven by anticipated increases in research services to be provided by the company  and by the replacement or upgrading of the company s equipment 
additionally  the company funded million of laboratory equipment in fiscal through capital leases

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies by the company 
the company has identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
the company s other service contracts generally consist of preclinical and clinical trial studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material to the company 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
the company s product revenue is derived primarily from sales of equipment utilized for scientific research 
revenue from equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one company product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  collectively referred to as indefinite lived assets  are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s indefinite lived assets over the implied fair value of those indefinite lived assets 
the implied fair value of the indefinite lived assets is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s indefinite lived assets 
of the  of intangible assets acquired from lcr   was assigned to methodologies   to the customer relationships  and  to the regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site 
the company estimated the economic useful life of the acquired methodologies and customer relationships to be years with amortization recognized using the straight line method 
the company has determined that the acquired regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site is an indefinite lived intangible not subject to amortization 
of the  in value of the intangible assets acquired from pklb   in value was assigned to methodologies   in value to subject relationships  and  in value to the regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site 
the company estimated the economic useful life of the acquired methodologies and subject relationships to be years with amortization recognized using the straight line method 
the company has determined that the acquired regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site is an indefinite lived intangible not subject to amortization 
the company s estimates of fair values and allocation of the purchase prices were determined with the analyses and assistance of an independent valuation firm 
income tax accounting income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws expected to be in effect at the time the differences reverse 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets in its balance sheet which typically represent items deducted currently in the financial statements that will be deducted in future periods in tax returns 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized in future periods 
the valuation allowance is based  in part  on management s estimate of future taxable income  the expected utilization of tax loss carry forwards and the expiration dates of tax loss carry forwards 
significant assumptions are used in developing the analysis of future taxable income for purposes of determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  in the opinion of management  are reasonable under the circumstances 
the company has an accumulated net deficit in its uk subsidiaries  consequently  united states deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
new accounting pronouncements the following two pronouncement will be adopted by the company for periods beginning october  in november   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas number dealing with inventory costs 
the statement clarifies what costs can be included in inventory  requiring that absorption factors be based on normal capacities of manufacturing facilities and excess capacity be expensed as incurred 
the company s current costing methodology substantially conforms with the new standard 
the company does not expect a material change in costing methods from adoption of this statement 
in december   sfas revised was issued dealing with share based payments 
in general  this statement requires that companies compute the fair value of options and other stock based employee incentives  and charge this value to operations over the period earned  generally the vesting period 
the only instruments we use that are governed by this statement are stock options for directors and employees 
the impact on reported results of adoption of this statement  required for interim and annual periods for years beginning after june   is presented in note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact on operations in future periods will be determined by amortizing the remaining value of our currently outstanding options  plus the value imputed to future option grants using those methods 
based on currently outstanding options  the impact on net earnings for fiscal will be to reduce net earnings by approximately  there is no impact on cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is the changes in interest rates 
the revolving credit agreement between the company and national city bank bears interest at a rate of either the bank s prime rate plus to basis points  or at libor plus to basis points  depending in each case upon the ratio of the company s interest bearing indebtedness less subordinated debt to ebitda  at the company s option 
historically  the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would not materially affect the consolidated operating results of the company 
while the company s revolving line of credit is at variable rates  the company s real estate mortgages are fixed at interest until june the company operates internationally and is  therefore  subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates change 
the effect of movements in the exchange rates was not material to the consolidated operating results of the company in fiscal years  and the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not materially affect the consolidated operating results of the company
