we operate our business in four business segments over the counter  or otc  mail order pharmacy  local pick up pharmacy  and vision 
the organization of our business into these four distinct segments allows our management to gain a comprehensive financial view of each of our key businesses and our business as a whole 
in addition  this segmentation better allows us to align strategies in fulfillment  marketing and customer care in order to optimize the overall customer experience  both within each segment and across all segments  and to maximize growth 
over the counter otc

table of contents included product revenues and fulfillment fees received under our wholesale otc fulfillment agreement with amazon 
com  inc  under which we acted as a nonexclusive wholesaler and fulfillment provider for certain otc products sold through the health personal care store on the amazon 
com website 
effective november   we terminated this agreement 
we source our otc products from various manufacturers and distributors 
we believe that continued growth in this segment will depend on our ability to offer customers a superior shopping experience and service  including providing a broad selection of basic necessity items and hard to find specialty items  which encourages customers to return to our websites and make repeat  replenishment  and impulse purchases 
in  we will focus on improving website conversion  refining our personalization efforts both on our website and in promotional e mails  and maximizing the profitability of each order 
mail order pharmacy 
our mail order pharmacy segment includes prescription drugs and supplies  other than prescription contact lenses  sold online or over the telephone through the www 
drugstore 
com web store and delivered to customers through our mail order facility 
we obtain our prescription inventory through rite aid corporation as part of our ongoing relationship 
we market to and serve both cash paying and insurance covered individuals  and we also serve as a third party provider of mail order prescription services for pharmacy benefit management companies  or pbms  and third party benefits companies 
in this segment  we focus our marketing efforts on establishing broader relationships with pbms and maximizing growth in our cash prescription business 
we anticipate that continued growth in this segment in will substantially depend on our ability to grow prescription volumes through these efforts 
local pick up pharmacy 
our local pick up pharmacy business segment includes prescription refills sold online or over the telephone through the www 
drugstore 
com web store or the www 
riteaid 
com web store which is powered by the www 
drugstore 
com web store and picked up by customers at rite aid stores 
in this segment  rite aid acts as our fulfillment partner 
our success in this segment depends on our ability to leverage our relationship with rite aid through its marketing media  including rite aid store receipts  weekly rite aid advertising circulars and e mail refill reminders 
in  we anticipate that net sales in the local pick up pharmacy segment will remain flat in comparison to  as we focus the majority of our marketing efforts on our core otc and mail order pharmacy segments 
vision

and its subsidiaries  collectively referred to as vision direct  through websites located at www

we purchase our contact lens inventory directly from various manufacturers and other distributors 
in  we plan to focus on a strategy of balancing customer acquisition with net margin in order to maximize our profits  rather than focusing exclusively on growth 
revenues 
we generate revenue primarily from product sales and shipping fees 
in  we reported consolidated total net sales of million  which reflected a million  or  increase over the week period in net sales increased year over year when calculated on a comparative week basis 
our net sales growth was driven by an increase in our total order volume  to million orders  and  to a lesser extent  a increase in our average net sales per order  to our net sales benefited from strong year over year growth in our core otc and mail order pharmacy segments  which grew by and  respectively  over and  respectively  on a comparative week basis 
excluding wholesale otc net sales and fulfillment fees of million in and million in  our net sales in the otc segment increased by year over year on a comparative week basis 
net sales in our local pick up pharmacy segment increased year over year on a comparative week basis and net sales in our vision segment decreased by year over year remaining flat on a comparative week basis

table of contents fulfillment and order processing expenses and general and administrative expenses both decreased year over year and technology and content expenses and marketing and sales expenses both increased year over year 
in addition  cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales year over year  as our fixed corporate infrastructure costs were spread over greater net sales

significant accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
additional information about our significant accounting policies is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of otc  mail order pharmacy  and vision products are recorded net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates and returns allowances 
revenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
return allowances  which reduce product sales by our estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
historically  product returns  and differences between our estimates and actual returns  have not been significant 
revenues from sales of otc products ordered through the amazon 
com website and fulfilled by drugstore 
com were recognized when we shipped the products from our distribution center 
according to the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf  we recorded fulfillment fees and revenues generated by the amazon 
com agreement in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we believe we acted as a principal  based on the fact that we bore general inventory risk associated with these sales 
effective november   we terminated our agreement with amazon 
com 
neither party has any material obligations following termination 

table of contents before december   all sales of customized vitamins through cns were recognized on a gross basis  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates and returns allowances 
on december   we entered into a fulfillment agreement with weil lifestyle  llc  or weil 
under the new agreement  revenues from sales of customized vitamins sold through our fulfillment agreement with weil are recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in accordance with eitf  we now record revenues generated by the weil agreement in our otc segment on a net basis  because we act as an agent  based on the fact that we earn a fixed dollar amount per customer transaction regardless of the amount billed to the customer and we do not bear general inventory risk associated with these sales 
non weil customized vitamin sales continue to be recognized on a gross basis  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates and returns allowances 
revenues from sales of prescription products ordered online or by telephone through the drugstore 
com web store or the riteaid 
com web store which is powered by the drugstore 
com web store for pick up at a rite aid store  including co payments received and collected on our behalf by rite aid  are recognized when the customer picks up the product 
in these circumstances  we utilize rite aid as our fulfillment partner 
according to the criteria outlined in eitf  we record revenues in our local pick up pharmacy segment on a gross basis  because we believe we act as a principal  based on the fact that  among other things  we bear both inventory risk and credit and collection risk associated with these sales 
for insured prescriptions in both our local pick up and mail order segments  the co payment and the insurance reimbursement which together make up the amount due to drugstore 
com constitute the full value of the prescription drug sale  and we receive this entire amount as cash 
we therefore recognize the entire amount as revenue when the order is shipped to the customer for mail order prescriptions or picked up by the customer for local pick up prescriptions 
periodically  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  or future rebates based upon a percentage of the current purchase  as well as other offers 
discounts  when accepted by our customers  are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction and are presented as a net amount in net sales 
rebates are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates have not differed materially from our estimates  which are adjusted quarterly 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust our inventories for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged and expired inventory  which is recorded as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our websites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we could understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  inventory reserves have not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangibles  or fas  we do not amortize goodwill but instead test for impairment at least annually 
we test for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter or whenever indicators of impairment occur 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment 
if impairment is determined  the second phase measures the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined using either a discounted cash flow methodology or methodology based on comparable market prices 

table of contents we review our indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment when indicators of impairment occur and annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
we compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value and record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we review the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  whenever an indicator of impairment occurs 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of recoverability 
the determination of whether impairment exists is based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
we measure any resulting impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 
for further detail regarding goodwill and other intangible assets  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
if our estimates of revenue growth or future cash flows prove to be inaccurate  we may have a future impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets or long lived assets 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
any such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position

our primary source of cash is sales made through our websites  for which we collect cash from credit card settlements or insurance reimbursements 
our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  salaries  marketing expenses  and overhead and fixed costs 
any projections of our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty for the reasons discussed in this section and in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report

with respect to each draw under this lease  of the sum of the draw amount plus interest determined at the time of the draw is payable in monthly installments over the months following the draw 
at the end of the month period  we will either pay the remaining in a single balloon payment or extend financing for an additional months 
all draws under this lease  which are limited to million  must be completed by june we have drawn the entire million under this lease  payable in monthly installments of  at an interest rate of 
in december  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with a bank 
the agreement includes a revolving line of credit allowing for borrowings up to million through june  and allowed for an additional million of borrowings thereafter  based on certain conditions specified in the agreement 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is the prime rate plus at january   and the revolving line of credit has a maturity date of one year from the date of borrowing

the agreement contains certain financial and non financial covenants with which we were in compliance at january  in march  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with the same bank 
this agreement includes a revolving line of credit allowing for borrowings of up to million  which accrue interest at the prime rate 
the revolving line of credit has a maturity date of one year from the date of advance 
the agreement allows for the conversion of up to million of the outstanding balance into a term loan within days of maturity 
we also lease computer equipment under non cancelable capital leases 
capital lease obligations bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature to months from the date of funding 
we secured additional funds of million during and  during through capital lease financing agreements  wherein we financed certain computer equipment  software  fixtures and equipment for periods of two years 
on march   we issued million shares of our common stock in a private placement  for aggregate cash consideration of million 
in connection with lease arrangements for our corporate headquarters  we were required to provide two standby letters of credit as security deposits 
the letters of credit were issued in the amounts of approximately  in july and approximately  in october both letters of credit were collateralized with cash 
effective october   one of these letters of credit expired and was replaced by another letter of credit 
the replacement letter of credit  which will be renewed annually until the end of the lease term  is funded under our revolving line of credit and is not required to be secured with cash 
the cash previously used as collateral for the expired letter of credit  approximately  was therefore released and made available for use in operations

term loans include debt obligations with a bank 
operating lease obligations consist of office building  distribution center and call center leases 
we do not have any future material noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services 
we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures until we begin generating positive operating cash flow 
however  any projections about our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
as a result  we may need to raise additional funds to fund our operating activities or for strategic flexibility if  for example  we pursue business or technology acquisitions or decide to build a new distribution center or if our expectations regarding our operations and anticipated capital expenditures change 
we have in the past and will continue to assess opportunities for raising additional funds by selling equity  equity related or debt securities  obtaining additional credit facilities or obtaining other means of financing for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial 
table of contents position 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
furthermore  if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution

we anticipate a net loss for the first quarter in the range of million to million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  capital lease obligations  and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments is not material to us 
we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
our financing facilities expose net earnings to changes in short term interest rates because interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at january   and the highest interest rate attributable to this outstanding balance was at january  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
we have investment risk exposure arising from our investments in marketable securities 
as of january   we had million of securities classified as marketable securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary
