item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the financial review which follows focuses on the factors affecting the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of nbt bancorp inc the registrant and its wholly owned subsidiaries  nbt bank  na the bank and nbt financial services  inc nbt financial  during and  in summary form  the preceding two years 
collectively  the registrant and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as the company 
net interest margin is presented in this discussion on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
average balances discussed are daily averages unless otherwise described 
the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with this review 
amounts in prior period consolidated financial statements are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the presentation 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions  in the application of certain accounting policies  about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
different amounts could be reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions were used in the application of these accounting policies 
the business of the company is providing commercial banking and financial services through its subsidiaries 
the company s primary market area is central and upstate new york and northeastern pennsylvania 
the company has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services 
the company s principal business is attracting deposits from customers within its market area and investing those funds primarily in loans and leases  and  to a lesser extent  in marketable securities 
the financial condition and operating results of the company are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on its earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily consisting of deposits and borrowings 
net income is also affected by provisions for loan and lease losses and noninterest income  such as service charges on deposit accounts  broker dealer fees  trust fees  and gains losses on securities sales  it is also impacted by noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  data processing  communications  occupancy  and equipment 

table of contents the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards  and actions of regulatory agencies 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations  or government policies may have a material impact on the company 
lending activities are substantially influenced by the demand for and supply of housing  competition among lenders  the level of interest rates  the state of the local and regional economy  and the availability of funds 
the ability to gather deposits and the cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market interest rates  fees and terms on deposit products  as well as the availability of alternative investments including mutual funds and stocks 
critical accounting policies the company has identified several policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these policies relate to the allowance for loan losses and pension accounting 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan and lease loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions significantly deteriorated  additional provisions for loan and lease losses would be required to increase the allowance 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s nonperforming loans and potential problem loans has a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
while management has concluded that the current evaluation of collateral values is reasonable under the circumstances  if collateral values were significantly lowered  the company s allowance for loan and lease policy would also require additional provisions for loan and lease losses 
management is required to make various assumptions in valuing its pension assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
changes to these assumptions could impact earnings in future periods 
the company takes into account the plan asset mix  funding obligations  and expert opinions in determining the various rates used to estimate pension expense 
the company also considers the moody s aa corporate bond yields and other market interest rates in setting the appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the company reviews expected inflationary and merit increases to compensation in determining the rate of increase in future compensation levels

table of contents total loans and leases increased at december   totaling billion from billion at december  the increase in loans and leases was driven by strong growth in home equity loans  consumer loans  and real estate construction and development primarily comprised of commercial real estate 
home equity loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december  the increase in home equity loans was due to strong product demand and successful marketing of home equity products in newer markets

real estate construction and development loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december   as the bank originated several large commercial construction development loans in in its newer markets 
commercial and commercial real estate remained relatively unchanged at december  when compared to december   as new loan originations were offset by prepayments as competition for these loan types was particularly strong across all of the company s markets in residential real estate mortgages declined million or at december  compared to december  as the company began selling real estate mortgages in the secondary market during the second half of as a means of limiting its exposure to long term interest rate risk 
the following table reflects the loan and lease portfolio by major categories as of december for the years indicated table composition of loan and lease portfolio december  in thousands residential real estate mortgages commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction and development agricultural and agricultural real estate consumer home equity lease financing total loans and leases real estate mortgages consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences

table of contents the company s automobile lease financing portfolio totaled million at december  and million at december  lease receivables primarily represent automobile financing to customers through direct financing leases and are carried at the aggregate of the lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values  net of unearned income and net deferred lease origination fees and costs 
net deferred lease origination fees and costs are amortized under the effective interest method over the estimated lives of the leases 
the estimated residual value related to the total lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly  and if there had been a decline in the estimated fair value of the residual that is judged by management to be other than temporary  including consideration of residual value insurance  a loss would be recognized 
adjustments related to such other than temporary declines in estimated fair value are recorded with other noninterest expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
one of the most significant risks associated with leasing operations is the recovery of the residual value of the leased vehicles at the termination of the lease 
a lease receivable asset includes the estimated residual value of the leased vehicle at the termination of the lease 
at termination  the lessor has the option to purchase the vehicle or may turn the vehicle over to the company 
the residual values included in lease financing receivables totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has acquired residual value insurance protection in order to reduce the risk related to residual values 
based on analysis performed by management  the company has concluded that no other than temporary impairment exists which would warrant a charge to earnings during the years ended december  and the following table  maturities and sensitivities of certain loans to changes in interest rates  are the maturities of the commercial and agricultural and real estate and construction development loan portfolios and the sensitivity of loans to interest rate fluctuations at december  scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the contractual payment is due

at december   the mix was fifteen ten year mortgage backed securities and cmos  us agency notes and bonds and of thirty twenty year mortgaged backed securities 
furthermore  the company shortened the estimated weighted average life of the total securities portfolio from years at december  to years at december  in the event of a rising rate environment  the company should be positioned to reinvest cash flows at a faster rate from shortening the expected life of the portfolio 
the average balance of securities held to maturity increased from million in to million in at december   securities held to maturity were comprised primarily of tax exempt municipal securities 
the yield on securities held to maturity increased from in to in from higher yields for tax exempt securities purchased during investments in frb and federal home loan bank fhlb stock increased to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by an increase in the investment in fhlb resulting from an increase in the company s borrowing capacity at fhlb

available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are recorded at fair value  with net unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in income 
transfers of securities between categories are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
securities with an other than temporary impairment are generally placed on non accrual status 
non marketable equity securities are carried at cost  with the exception of small business investment company sbic investments  which are carried at fair value in accordance with sbic rules 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses on securities sold are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold

the average balance of money market  savings and now accounts decreased collectively million or during when compared to the decrease in money market and now accounts was driven primarily from municipal customers shifting their funds into higher paying time deposits in the decrease in savings was driven primarily from retail customers shifting funds into higher paying money market accounts and time deposits 
the average balance of demand deposits increased million  or  from million in to million in solid growth in demand deposits was driven principally by increases in accounts from retail and business customers in newer markets 
the ratio of average demand deposits to total average deposits increased from in to in the rate paid on average interest bearing deposits increased bp from during to in the increase in rate on interest bearing deposits was driven primarily by pricing increases from money market accounts and time deposits 
these deposit products are more sensitive to interest rate changes 
the pricing increases for these products resulted from several increases in short term rates by the frb during combined with competitive pricing for market competitors 
the company expects this trend to continue for money market accounts and time deposits in the rates paid for now and savings accounts remained relatively unchanged for compared to these product types are not as sensitive to rate changes and pricing pressure from competitors was low 
if short term rates continue to rise as projected in  the company expects that pricing pressures will increase from competition  as a result  rates paid for savings and now accounts will likely increase 
additionally  if the difference in pricing for savings accounts compared to money market accounts and short term time deposits widens  the company expects to experience a shift from lower cost savings accounts to higher cost money market accounts and short term time deposits in the company anticipates these events will likely have an adverse impact on the company s net interest margin in
