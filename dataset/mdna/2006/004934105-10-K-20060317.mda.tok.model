industry background the two major kinds of integrated circuits ics used in electronic systems are analog and digital circuits  although mixed signal ics have both 
the three principal types of digital ics are processor  memory  and logic circuits 
processors are used for control and computing tasks  memory devices are used to store program instructions and data  and logic devices are used to adapt these processing and storage capabilities to a specific application 
logic circuits are found in practically every electronic system 

table of contents the logic design of competing electronic systems is often a principal area of differentiation 
unlike the processor and memory markets  which are dominated by a relatively few standard designs  the logic market is highly fragmented and includes  among many other segments  low capacity standard transistor transistor logic circuits ttls and custom designed asics 
ttls are standard logic circuits that can be purchased off the shelf and interconnected on a printed circuit board pcb but they tend to limit system performance and increase system size and cost compared with logic functions integrated at the circuit rather than the pcb level 
asics are designed and built for a specific application  providing electronic system manufacturers with the benefits of increased circuit integration improved system performance  reduced system size  and lower system cost 
asics include conventional gate arrays  standard cells  and programmable logic devices plds 
conventional gate arrays and standard cell circuits are customized to perform desired logical functions at the time the device is manufactured 
since they are hard wired at the wafer foundry by the use of photomasks  conventional gate arrays and standard cell circuits are subject to nonrecurring engineering nre charges and the time to market risks associated with any development cycle involving a foundry 
typically  hard wired asics are first delivered in production volumes months after the successful production of acceptable prototypes 
in addition  hard wired asics cannot be modified after they are manufactured  which subjects them to the risk of inventory obsolescence and constrains the system manufacturer s ability to change the logic design 
plds  on the other hand  are manufactured as standard devices and customized in the field by electronic system manufacturers using computer aided engineering cae design and programming systems 
plds are being used by a growing number of electronic system manufacturers to increase product differentiation and manufacturing flexibility and speed time to market 
plds include simple plds  complex plds cplds  and fpgas 
cplds and fpgas have gained market share because they generally offer greater capacity  lower total cost per usable logic gate  and lower power consumption than ttls and simple plds  and faster time to market and lower development costs and inventory risks than hard wired asics 
as photomask costs and nre charges continue to rise  cplds and particularly fpgas are becoming cost effective alternatives to hard wired asics at higher volumes 
even in high volumes  the time to market and manufacturing flexibility benefits of cplds and fpgas often outweigh their price premium over hard wired asics of comparable capacity for many electronic system manufacturers 
before a cpld or fpga can be programmed  there are various steps that must be accomplished by a designer using cae design software 
these steps include defining the function of the circuit  verifying the design  and laying out the circuit 
traditionally  logic functions were defined using schematic capture software  which permits the designer to essentially construct a circuit diagram on the computer 
as cplds and fpgas have increased in capacity  the time required to create schematic diagrams using schematic capture tools has often become unacceptably long  so designers have generally turned to hardware description languages hdls 
hdls permit the designer to describe the circuit functions at an abstract level and to verify the performance of logic functions at that level using a simulator 
the hdl description of the desired cpld or fpga device can then be fed into synthesis software  which automatically converts the abstract description into a gate level representation equivalent to that produced by schematic capture tools 
after a gate level representation of the logic function has been created and verified  it must be translated or laid out onto the generic logic modules of the cpld or fpga 
this is achieved by placing the logic gates and routing their interconnections  a process referred to as place and route 
after the layout of the device has been verified by timing simulation  the cpld or fpga can be programmed 
multiple suppliers of electronic design automation eda tools provide software to accomplish the design entry  simulation  and synthesis tasks for cplds and fpgas  but the place and route and programming software is generally developed and provided only by the cpld or fpga supplier 

table of contents electronic system manufacturers program a cpld or fpga to perform the desired logical functions by using a device programmer to change the state of the device s programming elements such as antifuses or memory cells through the application of an electrical signal 
programmers are typically available from both the pld supplier and third parties  and programming services are often available from both the pld supplier and its distributors 
most cplds are programmed with erasable programmable read only memories or other nonvolatile floating gate memory technologies 
many fpgas are programmed with static random access memory sram technology 
our fpgas use flash and antifuse programming elements 
after programming  the functionality and performance of the programmed cpld or fpga in the electronic system must be verified 
to a large extent  the characteristics of a cpld or fpga are dictated by the technology used to make the device programmable 
cplds and fpgas based on programming elements controlled by floating gates or srams must be configured by a separate boot device  such as the nonvolatile serial programmable read only memory prom commonly used with sram fpgas 
because these cplds and fpgas must be booted up  they are less reliable in the sense of being more prone to generate system errors  less secure  not functional immediately on power up  and require a separate boot device 
in addition  sram fpgas and cplds based on look up tables tend to consume more power 
fpgas based on flash and antifuse programming elements do not need to be booted up  which makes them more reliable  more secure  live at power up lapu  single chip solutions  and they also tend to operate at lower power 
these are all characteristics shared by hard wired asics but not by cplds or sram fpgas 
the technology used to make a cpld or fpga programmable also dictates whether the device is reprogrammable and whether it is volatile 
cplds and fpgas based on programming elements controlled by floating gates or srams are reprogrammable but lose their circuit configuration in the absence of electrical power 
fpgas based on antifuse programming elements are one time programmable and retain their circuit configuration permanently  even in the absence of power 
fpgas based on programming elements controlled by flash memory are reprogrammable and nonvolatile  retaining their circuit configuration in the absence of power 
as photomask and nre costs for hard wired asics continue to rise  fpgas are increasingly used as a cost effective alternative to hard wired asics for implementing complex design functions 
with this increase in adoption  fpgas have grown in size and complexity  making the security of the devices more important 
more often than not  the key ip that differentiates an electronic system from competitive offerings is now implemented in programmable logic 
consequently  the vulnerability of each system s unique value added ip is often a direct function of the security capabilities of the system s fpga 
since sram based fpgas must be configured at power on  the bitstream used to configure the sram fpga can be intercepted in route at the circuit level  electronically captured  and replicated 
alternatively  this configuration data can be read from the configuration device and manipulated or copied  or the on board prom can be replicated 
flash and antifuse fpgas do not require a start up bitstream  eliminating the possibility of configuration data being intercepted 
sram fpgas are also susceptible to being upset by neutrons and alpha particles 
when sram memories are used for data storage  these neutron induced errors are called soft errors 
when sram memories are used to store the configuration of an fpga  these neutron induced errors are called firm errors 
a firm error affects the device s configuration  which may cause the device to malfunction 
in addition  firm errors are not transient but will persist until detected and corrected 
there is a significant and 
table of contents growing risk of functional failure in sram based fpgas due to the corruption of configuration data 
historically a concern only for military  avionics  and space applications  firm errors have become more of a problem for ground based applications with each manufacturing process generation 
radiation testing has shown that antifuse and flash fpgas are not subject to loss of configuration due to neutrons or alpha particles 
electronic system manufacturers are continuing to demand greater flexibility  reliability  and performance as well as lower power  board space  and total system cost requirements 
this has put increasing pressure on ic suppliers to integrate analog  processor  programmable logic  and nonvolatile memory circuits in a single chip 
as a result  analog  processor  and hard wired asic suppliers are moving to add configurability to their product lines  and pld suppliers are moving to integrate analog  processor  and flash memory into their products 
in this race to develop psc solutions  pld suppliers have an advantage because programmable logic historically has been the most difficult of these technologies to master and the integration of analog and flash memory has already been proven in processor and hard wired asic technologies 
strategy our flash and antifuse technologies are different from  and have certain advantages over  the sram and other technologies used in competing plds 
our strategy is to offer innovative solutions to markets in which our technologies have a competitive advantage  including the psc market and the value based and system critical fpga markets 
a general competitive advantage that our technologies have is design security 
our nonvolatile  single chip pscs and fpgas offer practically unbreakable design security 
decapping and stripping of our flash devices reveals only the structure of the flash cell  not the contents 
similarly  the antifuses that form the interconnections within our antifuse fpgas do not leave a signature that can be electrically probed or visually inspected 
in addition  special security fuses are hidden throughout the fabric of our flash and antifuse devices 
these flashlock and fuselock security fuses cannot be accessed or bypassed without destroying the rest of the device  rendering ineffective both invasive and noninvasive attacks 
l psc market system on a chip ics socs contain all of the necessary hardware and electronic circuitry for a complete system and are increasingly used in small  complex electronic devices such as digital cameras  cellular phones  and personal digital assistants 
we address this market with our actel fusion pscs  which were introduced in and bring the benefits of true mixed mode programmable logic to socs 
by combining an advanced flash fpga core with flash memory blocks and analog peripherals and using a fully functional on chip soft flash processor  the actel fusion devices allow designers to integrate a wide range of functionality into a single device  simplify system design  reduce total system cost  and upgrade during the production cycle or in the field 
the actel fusion pscs are the most comprehensive single chip mixed signal programmable logic solutions available today 
l value based market much of the logic market is driven by cost effectiveness 
we address this value based market  which we believe represents the fastest growing segment of the fpga market  with our actel fusion  flash  and arm enabled fpgas 
in addition to low cost  our fpgas add the value of hard wired asics to the benefits provided by other plds 
like other plds  our fpgas reduce design risk  inventory investment  and time to market 
unlike other plds  our fpgas are nonvolatile  lapu  low power  single chip solutions 
in addition  logic designers can choose to use either hard wired asic or fpga software tools and design methodologies  and 
table of contents the architectures of our fpgas enable the utilization of predefined ip cores  which can be reused across multiple designs or product versions 
we also offer our customers a wide selection of cost sensitive and small form factor packages 
during  we introduced the actel fusion pscs  which were designed specifically for system management and control applications  our proasic and proasice fpga families  which are targeted specifically at the value based fgpa market  and our arm enabled m proasic e fpgas  which make the arm processor available to the masses without royalties or upfront licensing fees 
l system critical market the system critical market is driven primarily by reliability and security 
much of the logic market for military and aerospace applications is driven by reliability  nonvolatility  security  and resistance to radiation effects 
we address this market with our military  avionics  and space grade fpgas 
our antifuse and flash fpgas are reliable  nonvolatile  secure  and not susceptible to configuration corruption caused by radiation 
during  we shipped fully qualified rtaxs  rtaxs  and rtaxs fpgas to customers developing space flight systems and introduced the rtaxs fpga  the highest density radiation tolerant fpga specifically designed for space applications 
much of the market for automotive applications is driven by cost as well as reliability  nonvolatility  and security 
we address this market with our automotive line of fpgas  which we believe is the pld industry s broadest automotive offering 
products and services our product line consists of mixed signal actel fusion pscs based on flash technology  reprogrammable fpgas based on flash technology  one time programmable fpgas based on antifuse technology  and high reliability hirel fpgas 
in  fpgas accounted for of our net revenues  most of which was derived from the sale of antifuse fpgas 
in support of our pscs and fpgas  we offer ip products  design and development software  programming hardware  debugging tool kits and demonstration boards  system design  online prototyping  and programming services  and a web based resource center 
l pscs on december   we announced the immediate availability of the actel fusion pscs  the world s first mixed signal fpga family 
by integrating mixed signal analog  flash memory  and fpga fabric in a monolithic psc  the actel fusion devices enable designers to rapidly deliver feature rich systems to market 
in addition  when used in conjunction with our arm or based soft processor cores  the actel fusion technology provides a complete psc platform 
on march   we announced an expanded design infrastructure in support of our mafs device  the arm enabled version of the actel fusion psc 
bridging the industry standard arm technology with the first mixed signal fpga family  the arm enabled actel fusion psc represents the state of the art single chip psc platform 
the mafs family includes four devices of varying gate densities  levels of embedded flash  and analog channels 
samples of the mafs device are expected to be available in april  with the mafs scheduled for sampling in the second half of 
table of contents based on our proasic e fpga architecture  the actel fusion pscs take advantage of the unique properties of our flash technology  including the ability to support high voltage transistors  to meet the demanding requirements of mixed signal system design 
by integrating analog inputs and outputs i os and a configurable analog to digital converter  the actel fusion devices enable direct connection to and control of a wide variety of analog systems  including voltage  differential current  and temperature monitors 
the embedded flash memory gives electronic system designers exceptional flexibility  including the capability to reconfigure analog block settings to perform widely different functions by downloading data from embedded flash memory 
the actel fusion devices also feature flashlock security fuses and industry leading advanced encryption standard aes decryption to secure programmed ip and configuration data  offer low power sleep and stand by modes for power sensitive applications  and are specifically designed to handle level lapu system supervisory activities see business products and services supporting products and services resource center lapu 
the actel fusion pscs are appropriate for power management  thermal management  power up sequencing and configuration  battery charging  motor control  clock generation and distribution  and numerous other system management and control applications in the industrial  medical  military aerospace  communications  consumer  automotive  and computer markets 
l fpgas fpgas are used by manufacturers of automotive  communications  computer  consumer  industrial  military and aerospace  and other electronic systems to bring differentiated products to market rapidly 
we are the leading supplier of fpgas based on flash and antifuse technologies 
to meet the diverse requirements of our customers  we offer all of our fpgas except the radiation hardened devices in a variety of speed grades  package types  and or ambient environmental temperature tolerances 
commercial devices are qualified to operate at ambient temperatures ranging from zero degrees celsius c to c 
industrial devices are qualified to operate at ambient temperatures ranging from c to c

military devices are qualified to operate at ambient temperatures ranging from c to c 
high reliability or hirel devices are qualified to automotive or military temperature specifications 
we are a leading supplier of high reliability fpgas 
the capacity of fpgas is measured in gates  which traditionally meant four transistors 
as fpgas grew larger and more complex  no standard technique emerged for counting fpga gates 
the appearance of fpgas with memory further complicated matters because memory gates cannot be counted in the same way as logic gates 
when we use gate or gates to describe the capacity of fpgas  we mean maximum system equivalent gates unless otherwise indicated 
flash fpgas our flash based fpgas include the proasic  proasice  m proasic e  proasic plus  and proasic families 
the combination of a fine grained  single chip asic like architecture and nonvolatile flash configuration memory makes our flash based fpgas economical alternatives to asics for low and medium speed applications 
unlike other fpgas available on the market today  which are either volatile or non reprogrammable  our flash devices are nonvolatile and reprogrammable

resource center our web based resource center is intended to provide information on a variety of industry wide issues related to the continued displacement of hard wired asics by plds 
targeted at fpga and asic designers and system architects  the web site includes technology tutorials  frequently asked questions  market overviews  application notes  white papers  glossaries of industry terms  and links to relevant articles and third party resources 
on august   we announced our new ezone virtual magazine  which provides in depth information and updates on our new products  technologies  and partnerships 
the e magazine also includes links to whitepapers  application notes  and resource centers 
the inaugural issue of ezone featured in depth information on our new proasic family of fpgas as well as our partnership with arm and involvement with the airbus a commercial airliner 
live at power up lapu the lapu resource center provides designers with information regarding power up issues  including links to whitepapers  product information brochures  application notes  and other technical information 
to help simplify the selection of lapu devices  we created a new lapu classification system to quantify the initialization capabilities of various semiconductor solutions 
our lapu device classification system has three levels live at power up level  live after power up level  and live after system initialization level 
level lapu devices are operational between power on and power up the time at which the applied voltage has reached the lower limit of system voltage and is stable and include actel s devices and other nonvolatile fpgas and most cplds and hard wired asics 
level lapu devices require a configuration download from internal memory but are operational before 
table of contents system initialization and include flash in package sram fpgas and some cplds 
level lapu devices are operational only after the initialization of system clocks  resets  interfaces  and memories and include most processors and sram based fpgas 
only level lapu devices can assist in system start up tasks  system configuration  and supervision during voltage ramp up 
on september   we released new results showing that our nonvolatile fpgas offer up to  times better power on response time than competing sram based fpgas 
power the power resource center provides design engineers with information about the power characteristics of fpgas as well as tools to estimate and design for low power applications 
the four basic power components that need to be examined when evaluating the power consumption of different fpga technologies are in rush or power up power  configuration power  static power  and dynamic power 
the total system power requirements are a combination of all four of the power components 
unlike sram fpgas  flash and antifuse fpgas have no power up or configuration power components 
sram based fpgas also consume significantly more static power than their flash and antifuse counterparts 
all fpga technologies exhibit similar dynamic power performance 
of the three primary fpga technologies  only flash and antifuse have power characteristics similar to hard wired asics 
packaging the packaging resource center contains technical package details  discussions on the latest environmental issues  related industry articles and links  and design implementation tools 
this portal was created as the primary source for technical information about our fpga packaging solutions  but also serves as an industry reference for ic packaging issues and topics that impact the fpga design community 
a major environmental issue is the use of lead and other harmful compounds in commercial and consumer electronic devices 
we have offered green and lead free packages for all of our fpga product families since all of our green packages  which we define as being free of lead  halogenated compounds  and antimony oxides  are guaranteed to provide the same benefits and features as our standard packages 
we have also taken the extra step of qualifying our green packages to operate at the same moisture sensitivity level as our standard packages  providing designers with additional assurance that they can use our green packages without compromising performance or reliability 
soft firm errors independent radiation testing has shown that fpgas based on flash and antifuse technologies are not subject to configuration upsets caused by high energy neutrons naturally generated in the earth s atmosphere 
the testing also determined that sram based fpgas are vulnerable to neutron induced configuration loss not only under high altitude conditions  as traditionally believed  but also in ground based applications 
a neutron induced error in an sram cell controlling the configuration of an sram based fpga could result in an unpredictable change in functionality in the fpga 
this is called a firm error and may cause the host system to malfunction 
in ground based applications where reliability is a concern such as medical equipment  radar systems  telecommunications switches  and routers  
table of contents neutron induced malfunctions could significantly reduce system availability 
in airborne applications entrusted to fpgas such as aircraft engine controllers  flight computers  and weapons systems  the corruption of the system s functionality resulting from a configuration firm error could have disastrous consequences 
on march   we announced that an independent study confirmed that our devices are resistant to the harmful effects caused by naturally occurring alpha particles 
alpha particles are a form of radiation commonly emitted from impurities in semiconductor packaging material 
our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based fpgas suffered no failures during the testing  but volatile sram based fpgas from altera corporation altera and xilinx corporation xilinx suffered a considerable number of alpha induced configuration upsets  shedding further light on the risks posed by sram based fpgas for high reliability applications in the commercial  military  and aerospace industries 
the results of this independent study were published as an update to the report  radiation results of ser 
soft error rate 
test of actel  xilinx  and altera fpga instances  which is available in our soft firm errors resource center 
this web site also contains technology tutorials  white papers  a comprehensive glossary  and relevant links 
design security the purpose of our design security resource center is to provide semiconductor and design professionals with a database of information about security risks and the potential associated losses 
the web site contains technology tutorials  application notes  white papers  glossaries  and other information and links about design security  security countermeasures  affected systems  and solutions to defeat unfriendly attacks 
our solution is a range of nonvolatile single chip devices that offer practically unbreakable design security 
an important consideration for reprogrammable devices is the extent to which they can be safely configured in the field with isp 
the actel fusion and proasic e families provide a comprehensive solution for ip and programming security flash fpgas are nonvolatile  lapu  single chip  and have nonvolatile memory on chip  providing storage for keys and identifiers to control the secure isp and serialization processes  the contents of the fpga and memory can be secured independently through our flashlock mechanism  advanced aes encryption is used to secure transmission of programming files  and message authentication control is used to verify that programming information is not altered during transmission 
secure isp protects users of actel fusion and proasic e parts from harm in the form of overbuilding  device ip design theft  product tampering  and other acts of malicious intent 
total system cost total cost of ownership can be divided into two categories the direct costs of the bill of materials bom and pcb area and the less direct associated costs  which can be substantial and are often overlooked 
nonvolatile flash and antifuse fpga solutions offer direct cost savings by eliminating the support devices required by volatile sram based fpgas 
since our devices do not require reloading when system power is restored  there is no need for a configuration prom or power sequencing  brownout detection  reset controller  or clock generator devices in the pcb design 
in addition to reducing direct costs by eliminating unnecessary parts from the bom and pcb  our nonvolatile flash and antifuse fpgas lower associated total system costs by reducing design 
table of contents complexity  increasing reliability  lowering total system power consumption  reducing thermal  noise  and electro magnetic interference emi management issues  and simplifying materials management 
markets and applications fpgas can be used in a broad range of applications across nearly all electronic system market segments 
most customers use fpgas in low to medium volumes in the final production form of their products 
some high volume electronic system manufacturers use fpgas as a prototyping vehicle and convert production to lower cost asics  while others with time to market constraints use fpgas in the initial production and then convert to lower cost asics 
for electronic systems that have shortened product life cycles  system manufacturers are finding that the cost difference between hard wired asics and fpgas begins to shrink and that manufacturing flexibility becomes a more important element in the semiconductor decision process 
in addition  the emergence of new chip interface standards puts a premium on flexibility  causing more high volume electronic system manufacturers to retain fpgas in volume production

the hermetically sealed ceramic package has an extremely small footprint and is available for our rtsxsu fpgas  which are designed to function reliably under space flight conditions  and for our asxa fpgas  which are suitable for a wide range of industrial and military applications 
on july   we announced an expansion of our package selection to include a land grid array option for our rtax s fpga family 
with this package  military and aerospace customers have the flexibility to use their proprietary or preferred vendor technology to attach columns or solder balls to the package 
we are committed to continuous improvement in our products  processes  and systems and to making our quality and reliability systems conform to standards and requirements recognized worldwide 
on may   we announced that we had received stack certification from stack international after an extensive audit verifying our commitment to delivering quality products 
stack international consists of major electronic equipment manufacturers serving the worldwide high reliability and communications markets 
we also announced that we had been recertified for iso after an audit by nsf international  a world leader in management systems registrations 
these two certifications demonstrate the conformance of our quality systems to internationally recognized standards and are a benchmark of our commitment to supply high quality fpgas to our diverse customer base 
we are also qml and pure certified 
our qml certification confirms that quality management  procedures  processes  and controls are in place and comply with mil prf  the performance specification used by the us department of defense for monolithic ics 
qml certification demonstrates our commitment to supply the highest quality products for all types of high reliability  military  and space applications 
pure  which stands for peds plastic encapsulated devices used in rugged environments  is an association of european equipment makers dedicated to quality and reliability 
our pure certification is for plastic quad flat pack packages 
strategic relationships we enjoy ongoing strategic relationships with many of our customers  distributors  sales representatives  foundries  assembly houses  and other suppliers of goods and services  including the following on march   we announced jointly with prover technology  inc that the prover echeck equivalence checker had been validated for design verification in our libero ide and that prover had joined our eda alliance program 
prover echeck provides designers with an automated solution to identify 
table of contents implementation inconsistencies for our antifuse and flash based fpga devices in a range of high reliability designs  including military  aerospace  and communications applications 
on july   we announced jointly with hdl works the optimization of hdl works ease design entry tool for our libero ide design flow 
the ease graphical hdl design entry environment provides for design entry  modification  and maintenance of vhdl  verilog  and mixed language designs for fpgas and hard wired asics 
hdl works also joined our eda alliance program 
on january   we announced that bp microsystems  a leader in the device programming business  had selected our axcelerator fpgas across bp s full range of next generation programming solutions 
further strengthening this partnership  all seventh generation programmers from bp microsystems will support our proasic e families of devices 
the top end robotic arm production programmers from bp microsystems can program the proasic e devices in under seconds  permitting the automatic programming of thousands of devices per day with little operator intervention 
in addition  new jointly developed programming software enables individual device serialization of the flash read only memory rom in each proasic e fpga 
research and development our research and development expenditures were million  or of net revenues  in compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in our research and development expenditures are divided among circuit design  software development  and process technology activities  all of which are involved in the development of new products based on existing or emerging technologies 
in the areas of circuit design and process technology  our research and development activities also involve continuing efforts to reduce the cost and improve the performance of current products  including shrinks of the design rules under which such products are manufactured 
our software research and development activities include enhancing the functionality  usability  and availability of high level cae tools and ip cores in a complete and automated desktop design environment 
during  we introduced our ground breaking actel fusion mixed signal pscs see business products and services pscs  our leading edge flash and arm enabled flash product families see business products and services flash fpgas proasic e and m proasic e  and our highest density rad tolerant fpgas for space designs see business products and services hirel fpgas rad tolerant 
we also revealed our hirel product roadmap  which includes a new onshore manufactured rad hard fpga with qml class v screening see business products and services hirel fpgas 
we are in the process of developing our fourth generation flash based fpga architecture g 
while our general philosophy is to develop and deliver products to our commercial customer base and then enhance those products for military and aerospace customers  we are attempting with the benefit of funding from the united states government  which we believe will be in the range of to million for to develop by design a radiation hardened version of g concurrently with the commercial development 
competition the fpga market is highly competitive  and we expect that to increase as the market grows 
our competitors include suppliers of ttls and asics  including conventional gate arrays and standard cells  simple plds  cplds  and fpgas 
of these  we compete principally with suppliers of hard wired asics  cplds  and fpgas 
the primary advantages of hard wired asics are high capacity  high density  high speed  and low cost in production volumes 
these advantages are offset by long design cycles and high designs costs  
table of contents including photomask set and nre charges 
we compete with hard wired asic suppliers by offering lower design costs including low or no nres  shorter design cycles  and reduced inventory risks 
some customers elect to design and prototype with our products and then convert to hard wired asics to achieve lower costs for volume production 
for this reason  we also face competition from companies that specialize in converting cplds and fpgas  including our products  into hard wired asics 
we also compete with suppliers of cplds 
suppliers of these devices include altera  which purchased the pld business of intel in  lattice semiconductor corporation lattice  which purchased the cpld businesses of vantis corporation in  and xilinx  which purchased the cpld business of philips semiconductors in the circuit architecture of cplds gives them a performance advantage in certain lower capacity applications  although we believe that fpgas generally compete favorably with cplds 
however  altera is significantly larger than actel  offers broader product lines to a more extensive customer base  and has significantly greater financial  technical  sales  and other resources 
in addition  many newer cplds are reprogrammable  which permits customers to reuse a circuit multiple times during the design process 
while our flash fpgas are reprogrammable  antifuse fpgas are one time programmable  permanently retaining their programmed configuration 
we compete most directly with the other established fpga suppliers xilinx  altera  and lattice  which purchased the fpga business of agere systems  inc in we announced our intention to develop sram based fpga products in and abandoned the development in while we believe our products and technologies are superior to those of xilinx as well as altera and lattice in many applications requiring lower cost  nonvolatility  lower power  and or greater security  xilinx is substantially larger than actel  offers a broader product line to a more extensive customer base  and has substantially greater financial  technical  sales  and other resources 
in addition  the fpgas of xilinx  altera  and lattice are reprogrammable 
while our flash fpgas are reprogrammable  antifuse fpgas are one time programmable 
several companies have marketed antifuse based fpgas  including quicklogic corporation quicklogic 
in  we acquired the antifuse fpga business of texas instruments incorporated  which was the only second source supplier of our products 
xilinx  which is a licensee of certain of our patents  introduced antifuse based fpgas in and abandoned its antifuse fpga business in cypress semiconductor corporation  which was a licensed second source of quicklogic  sold its antifuse fpga business to quicklogic in we believe that we compete favorably with quicklogic  which is also a licensee of certain of our patents 
to date  we are the only supplier of fpgas with flash based architectures 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with gatefield under which we acquired the exclusive right to market and sell standard proasic products in process geometries of micron and less 
in  we introduced the flash based proasic family of fgpas 
in  we acquired gatefield in a merger 
we believe that the important competitive factors in our market are price  performance  capacity total number of usable gates  density concentration of usable gates  ease of use and functionality of development tools  installed base of development tools  reprogrammability  strength of sales organization and channels  power consumption  reliability  security  adaptability of products to specific applications and ip  ease  speed  cost  and consistency of programming  length of research and development cycle including migration to finer process geometries  number of i os  reliability  wafer fabrication and assembly capacity  availability of packages  adapters  sockets  programmers  and ip  technical service and support  and utilization of intellectual property laws 
our failure to compete successfully in any of these areas could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 

table of contents patents and licenses as of march   we had united states patents and applications pending for an additional united states patents 
we also had foreign patents and applications pending for patents outside the united states 
our patents cover circuit architectures  antifuse and flash structures  and programming methods among other things  and expire between and we expect to continue filing patent applications as appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies 
we believe that patents  along with such factors as innovation  technological expertise  and experienced personnel  will become increasingly important 
in connection with the settlement of patent litigation in  we entered into a patent cross license agreement with xilinx  under which xilinx was granted a license under certain of our patents that permits xilinx to make and sell antifuse based plds  and we were granted a license under certain xilinx patents to make and sell sram based plds 
xilinx introduced antifuse based fpgas in and abandoned its antifuse fpga business in we announced our intention to develop sram based fpga products in and abandoned the development in in  we entered into a license agreement with btr  inc btr pursuant to which btr licensed its proprietary technology to actel for development and use in fpgas and certain multichip modules 
at the end of  we elected under the license agreement to convert to a non exclusive license  as a consequence of which we will cease to pay btr advance royalties after march we are engaged in an arbitration proceeding with btr to determine whether certain actel products are subject to ongoing royalties under the license agreement 
in connection with the settlement of patent litigation in  we entered into a patent cross license agreement with quicklogic that covers the products of both companies that were first offered for sale on or before september   or future generations of such products 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have been and expect to be notified from time to time of claims that we may be infringing patents owned by others 
when probable and reasonably estimable  we make provision for the estimated settlement costs of claims for alleged infringement 
as we sometimes have in the past  we may obtain licenses under patents that we are alleged to infringe 
while we believe that reasonable resolution will occur  there can be no assurance that these claims will be resolved or that the resolution of these claims will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our failure to resolve a claim could result in litigation or arbitration  which can result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not determined in our favor 
as discussed above  we are currently involved in an arbitration with btr 
in addition  our evaluation of the impact of these pending disputes could change based upon new information 
subject to the foregoing  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending patent dispute is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position at january   or results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal quarter or year then ended 
employees at the end of  we had full time employees  including in marketing  sales  and customer support  in engineering and research and development  in operations  and in administration and finance 
this compares with full time employees at the end of  an increase of 
net revenues were approximately  per employee for compared with approximately  for this represents an increase of 
we have no employees represented by a labor union  have not experienced any work stoppages  and believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 

table of contents item a 
risk factors actel shareholders and prospective investors should carefully consider  along with the other information in this annual report on form k  the following l our future revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate and may fail to meet expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline  perhaps significantly 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to fluctuations resulting from general economic conditions and a variety of risks specific to actel or characteristic of the semiconductor industry  including booking and shipment uncertainties  supply problems  and price erosion 
these and other factors make it difficult for us to accurately project quarterly revenues and operating results  which may fail to meet our expectations 
any failure to meet expectations could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
a variety of booking and shipping uncertainties may cause our quarterly revenues and or operating results to fall short of expectations 
when we fall short of our quarterly revenue expectations  our operating results will probably also be adversely affected because the majority of our expenses are fixed and therefore do not vary with revenues 
we derive a large percentage of our quarterly revenues from bookings received during the quarter  making quarterly revenues difficult to predict 
our backlog which generally may be cancelled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty at the beginning of a quarter typically accounts for about half of our revenues during the quarter 
this means that we generate about half of our quarterly revenues from orders received during the quarter and turned for shipment within the quarter  and that any shortfall in turns orders will have an immediate and adverse impact on quarterly revenues 
there are many factors that can cause a shortfall in turns orders  including declines in general economic conditions or the businesses of our customers  excess inventory in the channel  and conversion of our products to hard wired asics or other competing products for price or other reasons 
in addition  we sometimes book a disproportionately large percentage of turns orders during the final weeks of the quarter 
any failure or delay in receiving expected turns orders would have an immediate and adverse impact on quarterly revenues 
we derive a significant percentage of our quarterly revenues from shipments made in the final weeks of the quarter  making quarterly revenues difficult to predict 
we sometimes ship a disproportionately large percentage of our quarterly revenues during the final weeks of the quarter  which makes it difficult to accurately project quarterly revenues 
any failure to effect scheduled shipments by the end of a quarter would have an immediate and adverse impact on quarterly revenues 

table of contents our military and aerospace shipments tend to be large and are subject to complex scheduling uncertainties  making quarterly revenues difficult to predict 
orders from the military and aerospace customers tend to be large and irregular  which contributes to fluctuations in our net revenues and gross margins 
these sales are also subject to more extensive governmental regulations  including greater export restrictions 
historically  it has been difficult to predict if and when export licenses will be granted  if required 
in addition  products for military and aerospace applications require processing and testing that is more lengthy and stringent than for commercial applications  which increases the complexity of scheduling and forecasting as well as the risk of failure 
it is often impossible to determine before the end of processing and testing whether products intended for military or aerospace applications will fail and  if they do fail  it is generally not possible for replacements to be processed and tested in time for shipment during the same quarter 
any failure to effect scheduled shipments by the end of a quarter would have an immediate and adverse impact on quarterly revenues 
we derive a majority of our quarterly revenues from products resold by our distributors  making quarterly revenues difficult to predict 
we generate the majority of our quarterly revenues from sales made through distributors 
since we generally do not recognize revenue on the sale of a product to a distributor until the distributor resells the product  our quarterly revenues are dependent on  and subject to fluctuations in  shipments by our distributors 
we are therefore highly dependent on the accuracy of shipment forecasts from our distributors in setting our expectations 
we are also highly dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of resale reports from our distributors 
late or inaccurate resale reports  particularly in the last month of a quarter  contribute to our difficulty in predicting and reporting our quarterly revenues and or operating results 
an unanticipated shortage of products available for sale may cause our quarterly revenues and or operating results to fall short of expectations 
in a typical semiconductor manufacturing process  silicon wafers produced by a foundry are sorted and cut into individual die  which are then assembled into individual packages and tested 
the manufacture  assembly  and testing of semiconductor products is highly complex and subject to a wide variety of risks  including defects in photomasks  impurities in the materials used  contaminants in the environment  and performance failures by personnel and equipment 
in addition  we may not discover defects or other errors in new products until after we have commenced volume production 
semiconductor products intended for military and aerospace applications and new products  such as our flash based actel fusion pscs and proasic e fpgas and antifuse based axcelerator fpgas  are often more complex and more difficult to produce  increasing the risk of manufacturing and design related defects 
our failure to effect scheduled shipments by the end of a quarter due to unexpected supply constraints would have an immediate and adverse impact on quarterly revenues 

table of contents unanticipated increases  or the failure to achieve anticipated reductions  in the cost of our products may cause our quarterly operating results to fall short of expectations 
as is also common in the semiconductor industry  our independent wafer suppliers from time to time experience lower than anticipated yields of usable die 
wafer yields can decline without warning and may take substantial time to analyze and correct  particularly for a company like actel that utilizes independent facilities  almost all of which are offshore 
yield problems are most common at new foundries  particularly when new technologies are involved  or on new processes or new products  particularly new products on new processes 
our fpgas are also manufactured using customized processing steps  which may increase the incidence of production yield problems as well as the amount of time needed to achieve satisfactory  sustainable wafer yields on new processes and new products 
in addition  if we discover defects or other errors in a new product that require us to re spin some or all of the product s mask set  we must expense the photomasks that are replaced 
this type of expense has become more significant as the cost and complexity of photomask sets has continued to increase 
lower than expected yields of usable die or other unanticipated increases in the cost of our products could reduce our gross margin  which would adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
in addition  in order to win designs  we generally must price new products on the assumption that manufacturing cost reductions will be achieved  which often do not occur as soon as expected 
the failure to achieve expected manufacturing or other cost reductions during a quarter could reduce our gross margin  which would adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
unanticipated reductions in the average selling prices of our products may cause our quarterly revenues and operating results to fall short of expectations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by intense price competition 
the average selling price of a product typically declines significantly between introduction and maturity 
we sometimes are required by competitive pressures to reduce the prices of our new products more quickly than cost reductions can be achieved 
we also sometimes approve price reductions on specific sales for strategic or other reasons 
unanticipated declines in the average selling prices of our products could cause our quarterly revenues and or gross margin to fall short of expectations  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial results 
l in preparing our financial statements  we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn out to be erroneous 
in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern income taxes  inventories  legal matters and loss contingencies  and revenues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  our operating results for the periods in which we revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially affected 

table of contents l our gross margin may decline as we increasingly compete with hard wired asics and serve the value based market 
the price we can charge for our products is constrained principally by our competition 
while it has always been intense  we believe that price competition for new designs is increasing 
this may be due in part to the transition toward high level design methodologies 
designers can now wait until later in the design process before selecting a pld or hard wired asic and it is easier to convert between competing plds or between a pld and a hard wired asic 
the increased price competition may also be due in part to the increasing penetration of plds into price sensitive markets previously dominated by hard wired asics 
we have strategically targeted many of our products at the value based market  which is defined primarily by low prices 
if our strategy is successful  we will generate an increasingly greater percentage of our net revenues from low price products  which may make it more difficult to maintain our gross margin at our historic levels 
any long term decline in our gross margin may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
l we may not win sufficient designs  or the designs we win may not generate sufficient revenues  for us to maintain or expand our business 
in order for us to sell an fpga  our customer must incorporate our fpga into the customer s product in the design phase 
we devote substantial resources  which we may not recover through product sales  to persuade potential customers to incorporate our fpgas into new or updated products and to support their design efforts including  among other things  providing design and development software 
these efforts usually precede by many months and often a year or more the generation of fpga sales  if any 
in addition  the value of any design win depends in large part upon the ultimate success of our customer s product in its market 
our failure to win sufficient designs  or the failure of the designs we win to generate sufficient revenues  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
l our products are complex and may contain errors or defects that could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
our products are complex and may contain errors  manufacturing defects  design defects  or otherwise fail to comply with our specifications  particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our new products are being designed on ever more advanced processes  adding cost  complexity  and elements of experimentation to the development  particularly in the areas of mixed voltage and mixed signal design 
we rely primarily on our in house personnel to design test operations and procedures to detect any errors prior to delivery of our products to customers 
during  several us government contractors reported a small percentage of functional failures in our rtsx s and sx a antifuse devices manufactured on a micron antifuse process at the original manufacturer of those fpgas 
on february   the aerospace corporation aerospace proposed a series of experiments to test various hypotheses on the root cause of the failures and to generate reliability data that could be used by space industry participants in deciding whether or not to launch spacecraft with rtsx s fpgas that were already integrated 
on june   we announced the availability of rtsx su devices from umc 
the micron process at umc used to manufacture our rtsx su and sx a devices appears to create antifuses that are less vulnerable to the failure mechanisms identified to date 
during  aerospace and actel each recommended that customers switch to umc manufactured rtsx su devices if their schedules permitted  and we offered to accept rtsx s parts from the original manufacturer in exchange for rtsx su parts 
by the fourth quarter of  most customers had decided to switch to rtsx su devices 
during the third quarter of  we notified customers that the exchange offer would end on september  
table of contents programs to test umc parts have been or are in the process of being conducted by actel  nasa  aerospace  and the japan aerospace exploration agency 
to date more than million hours of testing has been conducted on approximately  space grade rtsx su devices with one to three failures observed depending upon how a failure is defined  and more than million hours of testing has been conducted on approximately  commercial grade sx a devices with to failures observed using the same definitions of failure 
while the various programs have different objectives and utilize different test vehicles and protocols  all are accelerated life testing programs that make use of overstress conditions to cause the product to fail more quickly 
accelerated life testing is complicated by the presence of multiple stress conditions  multiple failure mechanisms  and transient conditions in the test equipment and requires special analysis techniques to translate the times to failure data obtained under the overstress conditions to normal use conditions 
the multi step task of fitting mathematical models to the overstress data is critical  since relatively small differences in the models can extrapolate into very different conclusions 
utilizing all of the available data  aerospace has calculated a failure in time fit rate for our rtsx su devices manufactured at umc of to depending on the definition of failure for an average design  mission life  and amount of screening time 
a fit is one failure per billion device hours  so if a group of devices has a fit rate of to  the customer should expect between and failures per billion device hours 
a billion hours is more than centuries 
on february   aerospace brought to a close the regular meeting of space industry participants on this matter  although testing will continue 
any error or defect in our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
if problems occur in the operation or performance of our products  we may experience delays in meeting key introduction dates or scheduled delivery dates to our customers  in part because our products are manufactured by third parties 
these problems also could cause us to incur significant re engineering costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems 
any error or defect might require product replacement or recall or obligate us to accept product returns 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business in the short and or long term 
any product liability claim could pose a significant risk to our business  financial condition  and operating results 
product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our products 
our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the end products into which they are incorporated 
a defect or failure in our product could cause failure in our customer s end product  so we could face claims for damages that are much higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved 
in addition  product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace  automotive  and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of 
table of contents these products 
any product liability claim  whether or not determined in our favor  can result in significant expense  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  and harm our business 
in the event of an adverse settlement of any product liability claim or an adverse ruling in any product liability litigation  we could incur significant monetary liabilities  which may not be covered by any insurance that we carry and might have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and or operating results 
l we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing  or selling competitive new or improved products at acceptable margins 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence  and price erosion  making the timely introduction of new or improved products critical to our success 
our failure to design  develop  market  and sell new or improved products that satisfy customer needs  compete effectively  and generate acceptable margins may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
while most of our product development programs have achieved a level of success  some have not 
for example we announced our intention to develop sram based fpga products in and abandoned the development in principally because the product would no longer have been competitive 
we introduced our varicore embeddable reprogrammable gate array epga logic core based on sram technology in revenues from varicore epgas did not materialize and the development of a more advanced varicore epga was cancelled 
in this case  a market that we believed would develop did not emerge 
in  we also launched our bridgefpga initiative to address the i o problems created within the high speed communications market by the proliferation of interface standards 
we introduced the antifuse based axcelerator fpga  which has dedicated i o circuits that can support multiple interface standards  in however  the development of subsequent bridgefpga products was postponed in due principally to the prolonged downturn in the high speed communications market 
the development was cancelled in primarily because the subsequent bridgefpga products would no longer have been competitive 
our experience generally suggests that the risk is greater when we attempt to develop products based in whole or in part on technologies with which we have limited experience 
during  we introduced our new actel fusion technology  which integrates analog capabilities  flash memory  and fpga fabric into a single psc that may be used with soft processor cores  including the arm processor core that we offer 
we have limited experience with analog circuitry and soft processor cores and no prior experience with pscs 
our introduction of the actel fusion psc presents numerous significant challenges 
when entering a new market  the first mover typically faces the greatest market and technological challenges 
to be successful in the psc market and realize the advantages of being the initial entrant  we should understand the market  the competition  and the value proposition that we are bringing to potential customers  identify the early adopters and understand their buying process  decision criteria  and support requirements  and select the right sales channels and provide the right customer service  logistical  and technical support  including training 
any or all of these may be different for the psc market than for the value based or system critical fpga markets 
meeting these 
table of contents challenges is a top priority for actel and particularly our sales and marketing organization 
our failure to meeting these challenges could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
numerous factors can cause the development or introduction of new products to fail or be delayed 
to develop and introduce a product  we must successfully accomplish all of the following anticipate future customer demand and the technology that will be available to meet the demand  define the product and its architecture  including the technology  silicon  programmer  ip  software  and packaging specifications  obtain access to advanced manufacturing process technologies  design and verify the silicon  develop and release evaluation software  layout the fpga and other functional blocks along with the circuitry required for programming  integrate the fpga block with the other functional blocks  simulate ie  test the design of the product  tapeout the product ie  compile a database containing the design information about the product for use in the preparation of photomasks  generate photomasks for use in manufacturing the product and evaluate the software  manufacture the product at the foundry  verify the product  and qualify the process  characterize the product  and release production software 
each of these steps is difficult and subject to failure or delay  and the failure or delay of any step can cause the failure or delay of the entire development and introduction 
in addition to failing to meet our development and introduction schedules for new products or the supporting software or hardware  our new products may not gain market acceptance  and we may not respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
any failure to successfully define  develop  market  manufacture  assemble  test  or program competitive new products could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 

table of contents new products are subject to greater design and operational risks 
our future success is highly dependent upon the timely development and introduction of competitive new products at acceptable margins 
however  there are greater design and operational risks associated with new products 
the inability of our wafer suppliers to produce advanced products  delays in commencing or maintaining volume shipments of new products  the discovery of product  process  software  or programming defects or failures  and any related product returns could each have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operation 
new products are subject to greater technology risks 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have experienced from time to time in the past  and expect to experience in the future  difficulties and delays in achieving satisfactory  sustainable yields on new products 
the fabrication of antifuse and flash wafers is a complex process that requires a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  and effective cooperation between actel and the foundry to produce acceptable yields 
minute impurities  errors in any step of the fabrication process  defects in the photomasks used to print circuits on a wafer  and other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be non functional 
yield problems increase the cost of our new products as well as time it takes us to bring them to market  which can create inventory shortages and dissatisfied customers 
any prolonged inability to obtain adequate yields or deliveries of new products could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
new products generally have lower gross margins 
our gross margin is the difference between the amount it costs actel to make our products and the revenues we receive from the sale of those products 
one of the most important variables affecting the cost of our products is manufacturing yields 
with our customized antifuse and flash manufacturing process requirements  we almost invariably experience difficulties and delays in achieving satisfactory  sustainable yields on new products 
until satisfactory yields are achieved  gross margins on new products are generally lower than on mature products 
the lower gross margins typically associated with new products could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
l we face intense competition and have some competitive disadvantages that we may not be able to overcome 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive 
our competitors include suppliers of hard wired asics  cplds  and fpgas 
our biggest direct competitors are xilinx  altera  and lattice  all of which are suppliers of cplds and sram based fpgas  and quicklogic  a supplier of antifuse based fpgas 
altera and lattice also recently announced the development of fpgas manufactured on embedded flash processes 
in addition  we face competition from suppliers of logic products based on new or emerging technologies 
while we seek to monitor developments in existing and emerging technologies  our technologies may not remain competitive 
we also face competition from companies that specialize in converting our products into hard wired asics 
many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have more resources 
we are much smaller than xilinx and altera  which have broader product lines  more extensive customer bases  and substantially greater financial and other resources 
additional 
table of contents competition is also possible from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers  all of which are larger and have broader product lines  more extensive customer bases  and substantially greater financial and other resources than actel  including the capability to manufacture their own wafers 
we may not be able to overcome these competitive disadvantages 
our antifuse technology is not reprogrammable  which is a competitive disadvantage in most cases 
all existing fpgas not based on antifuse technology and certain cplds are reprogrammable 
the one time programmability of our antifuse fpgas is necessary or desirable in some applications  but logic designers generally prefer to prototype with a reprogrammable logic device 
this is because the designer can reuse the device if an error is made 
the visibility associated with discarding a one time programmable device often causes designers to select a reprogrammable device even when an alternative one time programmable device offers significant advantages 
this bias in favor of designing with reprogrammable logic devices appears to increase as the size of the design increases 
although we now offer reprogrammable flash devices  we may not be able to overcome this competitive disadvantage 
our flash and antifuse technologies are not manufactured on standard processes  which is a competitive disadvantage 
our antifuse based fpgas and to a lesser extent flash based pscs and fpgas are manufactured using customized steps that are added to otherwise standard manufacturing processes of independent wafer suppliers 
there is considerably less operating history for the customized process steps than for the foundries standard manufacturing processes 
our dependence on customized processing steps means that  in contrast with competitors using standard manufacturing processes  we generally have more difficulty establishing relationships with independent wafer manufacturers  take longer to qualify a new wafer manufacturer  take longer to achieve satisfactory  sustainable wafer yields on new processes  may experience a higher incidence of production yield problems  must pay more for wafers  and may not obtain early access to the most advanced processes 
for example  we expect that our next generation flash product families will be manufactured on a nanometer process and have found it challenging to identify and procure fabrication process arrangements for our technology development activities 
any of these factors could be a material disadvantage against competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
as a result of these factors  our products typically have been fabricated using processes at least one generation behind the processes used by competing products 
as a consequence  we generally have not fully realized the benefits of our technologies 
although we are attempting to obtain earlier access to advanced processes  we may not be able to overcome these competitive disadvantages 
l our business and operations may be disrupted by events that are beyond our control or the control of our business partners 
our performance is subject to events or conditions beyond our control  and the performance of each of our foundries  suppliers  subcontractors  distributors  agents  and customers is subject to events or conditions beyond their control 
these events or conditions include labor disputes  acts of public enemies or terrorists  war or other military conflicts  blockades  insurrections  riots  epidemics  quarantine restrictions  landslides  lightning  earthquakes  fires  storms  floods  washouts  arrests  civil disturbances  restraints by or actions of governmental bodies acting in a sovereign capacity including export or security restrictions on information  material  personnel  equipment  or otherwise  breakdowns of plant or machinery  and inability to obtain 
table of contents transport or supplies 
this type of disruption could impair our operations  which may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
our corporate offices are located in california  which was subject to power outages and shortages during and more extensive power shortages in the state could disrupt our operations and interrupt our research and development activities 
our foundry partners in japan and taiwan as well as our operations in california are located in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past 
in addition  many of the countries outside of the united states in which our foundry partners and assembly and other subcontractors are located have unpredictable and potentially volatile economic  social  or political conditions  including the risks of conflict between taiwan and china or between north korea and south korea 
these countries may also be more susceptible to epidemics 
for example  an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars occurred in hong kong  singapore  and china in the occurrence of these or similar events or circumstances could disrupt our operations and may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
l we have only limited insurance coverage 
our insurance policies provide coverage for only certain types of losses and may not be adequate to fully offset even covered losses 
if we were to incur substantial liabilities not adequately covered by insurance  our business  financial condition  and or operating results could be adversely and perhaps materially affected 
l our business depends on numerous independent third parties whose interests may diverge from our interests 
we rely heavily on  but generally have little control over  our independent foundries  suppliers  subcontractors  and distributors 
our independent wafer manufacturers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy our needs in a timely manner  which could harm our business 
we do not manufacture any of the semiconductor wafers used in the production of our fpgas 
our wafers are currently manufactured by chartered in singapore  infineon in germany  matsushita in japan  umc in taiwan  and winbond in taiwan 
our reliance on independent wafer manufacturers to fabricate our wafers involves significant risks  including lack of control over capacity allocation  delivery schedules  the resolution of technical difficulties limiting production or reducing yields  and the development of new processes 
although we have supply agreements with some of our wafer manufacturers  a shortage of raw materials or production capacity could lead any of our wafer suppliers to allocate available capacity to other customers  or to internal uses in the case of infineon  which could impair our ability to meet our product delivery obligations and may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
we will not generate significant revenues from the sale of rh products for some time after our supply of rh and rh parts is exhausted 
during the second quarter of  we informed customers that our rh and rh parts had been discontinued and provided customers with a last time opportunity to purchase such parts  subject to availability 
we typically have generated quarterly revenues of several million dollars from the sale of rh parts 
after our supply of rh and rh parts is exhausted  which we anticipate will occur during the second or third quarters 
table of contents of  we will generate minimal revenue from the sale of rh parts in contrast to revenue from the sale of rt parts  which may actually benefit from the discontinuation until sales of our rhaxs part begin to ramp 
delivery of rhaxs production parts is planned by the end of our quarterly revenues will be adversely affected by any decline in revenue from the sale of rh parts 
our limited volume and customized process requirements generally make us less attractive to independent wafer manufacturers 
the semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced shortages of manufacturing capacity 
when production capacity is tight  the relatively small number of wafers that we purchase from any foundry and the customized process steps that are necessary for our technologies put us at a disadvantage to foundry customers who purchase more wafers manufactured on standard processes 
to secure an adequate supply of wafers  we may consider various transactions  including the use of substantial nonrefundable deposits  contractual purchase commitments  equity investments  or the formation of joint ventures 
any of these transactions could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
identifying and qualifying new independent wafer manufacturers is difficult and might be unsuccessful 
if our current independent wafer manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products as required  we would have to identify and qualify additional foundries 
no additional wafer foundries may be able or available to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis 
even if we are able to identify a new third party manufacturer  the costs associated with manufacturing our products may increase 
in any event  the qualification process typically takes one year or longer  which could cause product shipment delays  and qualification may not be successful 
any of these developments could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
our independent assembly subcontractors may be unable or unwilling to meet our requirements  which could delay product shipments and result in the loss of customers or revenues 
we rely primarily on foreign subcontractors for the assembly and packaging of our products and  to a lesser extent  for the testing of our finished products 
our reliance on independent subcontractors involves certain risks  including lack of control over capacity allocation and delivery schedules 
we generally rely on one or two subcontractors to provide particular services for each product and from time to time have experienced difficulties with the timeliness and quality of product deliveries 
we have no long term contracts with our subcontractors and certain of those subcontractors sometimes operate at or near full capacity 
any significant disruption in supplies from  or degradation in the quality of components or services supplied by  our subcontractors could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 

table of contents our independent software and hardware developers and suppliers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy our needs in a timely manner  which could impair the introduction of new products or the support of existing products 
we are dependent on independent software and hardware developers for the design  development  supply  maintenance  and support of some of our analog capabilities  ip cores  design and development software  programming hardware  design diagnostics and debugging tool kits  and demonstration boards or certain elements of those products 
our reliance on independent developers involves certain risks  including lack of control over delivery schedules and customer support 
any failure of or significant delay by our independent developers to complete software and or hardware under development in a timely manner could disrupt the release of our software and or the introduction of our new products  which might be detrimental to the capability of our new products to win designs 
any failure of or significant delay by our independent suppliers to provide updates or customer support could disrupt our ability to ship products or provide customer support services  which might result in the loss of revenues or customers 
any of these disruptions could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
our future performance will depend in part on the effectiveness of our independent distributors in marketing  selling  and supporting our products 
in  sales made through distributors accounted for of our net revenues 
our distributors offer products of several different companies  so they may reduce their efforts to win new designs or sell our products or give higher priority to other products 
this is particularly a concern with respect to any distributor that also sells products of our direct competitors 
a reduction in design win or sales effort  termination of relationship  failure to pay for products  or discontinuance of operations because of financial difficulties or for other reasons by one or more of our current distributors could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
distributor contracts generally can be terminated on short notice 
although we have contracts with our distributors  the agreements are terminable by either party on short notice 
we consolidated our distribution channel in by terminating our agreement with arrow electronics  inc  which accounted for of our net revenues in on march   we again consolidated our distribution channel by terminating our agreement with pioneer standard electronics  inc  which accounted for of our net revenues in  after which unique technologies  inc unique  a sales division of memec  was our sole distributor in north america 
unique accounted for of our net revenues in during  avnet acquired memec  after which avnet became our sole distributor in north america 
unique and avnet accounted for of our net revenues in even though xilinx is avnet s biggest line  our transition from unique to avnet was generally satisfactory 
the loss of avnet as a distributor  or a significant reduction in the level of design wins or sales generated by avnet  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 

table of contents fluctuations in inventory levels at our distributors can affect our operating results 
our distributors occasionally build inventories in anticipation of significant growth in sales and  when such growth does not occur as rapidly as anticipated  substantially reduce the amount of product ordered from us in subsequent quarters 
such a slowdown in orders generally reduces our gross margin because we are unable to take advantage of any manufacturing cost reductions while the distributor depletes its inventory 
l we are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with the conduct of international business 
unlike our older rtsx s and rtsx su space grade fpgas  our new rtax s space grade fpgas are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations itar  which is administered by the us department of state 
itar controls not only the export of rtax s fpgas  but also the export of related technical data and defense services as well as foreign production 
while we believe that we have obtained and will continue to obtain all required licenses for rtax s fpga exports  we have undertaken corrective actions with respect to the other itar controls and are implementing improvements in our internal compliance program 
if the corrective actions and improvements were to fail or be ineffective for a prolonged period of time  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
in addition  the fact that our new rtax s space grade fpgas are itar controlled may make them less attractive to foreign customers  which could also have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
we depend on international operations for almost all of our products 
we purchase almost all of our wafers from foreign foundries and have almost all of our commercial products assembled  packaged  and tested by subcontractors located outside the united states 
these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations  including trade barriers and other restrictions  changes in trade policies  governmental regulations  currency exchange fluctuations  reduced protection for intellectual property  war and other military activities  terrorism  changes in social  political  or economic conditions  and other disruptions or delays in production or shipments  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
we depend on international sales for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales to customers outside north america accounted for of net revenues in  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
international sales are subject to the risks described above as well as generally longer payment cycles  greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable  and currency restrictions 
we also maintain foreign sales offices to support our international customers  distributors  and sales representatives  which are subject to local regulation 
in addition  international sales are subject to the export laws and regulations of the united states and other countries 
changes in united states export laws that require us to obtain additional export licenses sometimes cause significant shipment delays 
any future restrictions or charges imposed by the united states or any other country on our international sales or sales offices could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 

table of contents l our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by downturns or other changes in the general economy  in the semiconductor industry  in our major markets  or at our major customers 
we have experienced substantial period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to conditions in the overall economy  in the general semiconductor industry  in our major markets  and at our major customers 
we may again experience these fluctuations  which could be adverse and may be severe 
our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by future downturns in the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry historically has been cyclical and periodically subject to significant economic downturns  which are characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated price erosion  and overcapacity 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we experienced and the semiconductor industry in general experienced reduced bookings and backlog cancellations due to excess inventories at communications  computer  and consumer equipment manufacturers and a general softening in the overall economy 
during this downturn  which was severe and prolonged  we experienced lower revenues  which had a substantial negative effect on our operating results 
any future downturns in the semiconductor industry may have a similar adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by future downturns in the communications market 
we estimate that sales of our products to customers in the communications market accounted for of our net revenues for compared with for and for like the semiconductor industry in general  the communications market has been cyclical and periodically subject to significant downturns 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  the communications market suffered its worst downturn in recent history 
as a result  we experienced reduced revenues and operating results 
any future downturns in the communications market may have a similar adverse effect on our business  revenues  and or operating results 
our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by future downturns in the military and aerospace market 
we estimate that sales of our products to customers in the military and aerospace industries  which carry higher overall gross margins than sales of products to other customers  accounted for of our net revenues for compared with for and and for in general  we believe that the military and aerospace industries have accounted for a significantly greater percentage of our net revenues since the introduction of our rad hard fpgas in and our rad tolerant fpgas in any future downturn in the military and aerospace market could have a materially adverse effect on our revenues and or operating results 
our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in the military and aerospace market 
in  secretary of defense william perry directed the department of defense to avoid government unique requirements when making purchases and rely more on the commercial marketplace 
we believe that this trend toward the use of off the shelf products generally has 
table of contents helped our business 
however  if this trend continued to the point where defense contractors customarily purchased commercial grade parts rather than military grade parts  the revenues and gross margins that we derive from sales to customers in the military and aerospace industries would erode  which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
on the other hand  there are signs that this trend toward the use of off the shelf products may be reversing 
if defense contractors were to use more customized hard wired asics and fewer off the shelf products  the revenues and gross margins that we derive from sales to customers in the military and aerospace industries may erode  which could also have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
our revenues and or operating results may be adversely affected by future downturns at any our major customers 
a relatively small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion our net revenues 
we have experienced periods in which sales to one or more of our major customers declined significantly as a percentage of our net revenues 
for example  lockheed martin accounted for of our net revenues during compared with during we believe that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of net revenues in future periods 
the loss of a major customer  or decreases or delays in shipments to major customers  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
l any acquisition we make may harm our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
we have a mixed history of success in our acquisitions 
for example in  we acquired agl for consideration valued at million 
we acquired agl for technology used in the unsuccessful development of an sram based fpga 
in  we acquired prosys technology  inc prosys for consideration valued at million 
we acquired prosys for technology used in our varicore epga logic core  which was introduced in but for which no market emerged 
also in  we completed our acquisition of gatefield for consideration valued at million 
we acquired gatefield for its flash technology and proasic fpga family 
we introduced the second generation proasic plus product family in and the third generation proasic e families in we also introduced the flash based actel fusion psc in actel is currently the only company offering fpgas with a nonvolatile  reprogrammable architecture 
in pursuing our business strategy  we may acquire other products  technologies  or businesses from third parties 
identifying and negotiating these acquisitions may divert substantial management time away from our operations 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  and or involve the issuance of additional actel equity securities 
the issuance of additional equity securities may dilute  and could represent an interest senior to  the rights of the holders of our common stock 
an acquisition could involve significant write offs possibly resulting in a loss for the fiscal year s in which taken and would require the amortization of any identifiable intangibles over a number of years  which would adversely affect earnings in those years 
any acquisition would require attention from our management to integrate the acquired entity into our operations  may require us to develop expertise outside our existing business  and could result in departures of management from either actel or the acquired entity 
an acquired 
table of contents entity could have unknown liabilities  and our business may not achieve the results anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
the occurrence of any of these circumstances could disrupt our operations and may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
l changing accounting  corporate governance  public disclosure  or tax rules or practices could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
pending or new accounting pronouncements  corporate governance or public disclosure requirements  or tax regulatory rulings could have an impact  possibly material and adverse  on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
any change in accounting pronouncements  corporate governance or public disclosure requirements  or taxation rules or practices  as well as any change in the interpretation of existing pronouncements  requirements  or rules or practices  may call into question our sec or tax filings and could affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change 
changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead require companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we will be required to implement the standard no later than the fiscal year that begins january   and expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on our consolidated operating results and earnings per share 
in addition  we historically have used stock options as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of our shareholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
to the extent that sfas no 
r or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased out of pocket compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy  or find it difficult to attract  retain  and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business and or operating results 
compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related corporate governance and public disclosure requirements has resulted in significant additional expense and uncertainty 
changing laws  regulations  and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  have resulted in significant additional expense and uncertainty 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  and therefore intend to invest the resources necessary to comply with evolving laws  regulations  and standards 
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses as well as a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
these new or changed laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and 
table of contents governance practices 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations  and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies  we might be subject to lawsuits or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq national market  and our reputation may be harmed 
we evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent public accountants to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in performing the system and process evaluation and testing required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section  we incurred significant additional expenses  which adversely affected our operating results and financial condition and diverted a significant amount of management s time 
while we believe that our internal control procedures are adequate  we may not be able to continue complying with the requirements relating to internal controls or other aspects of section in a timely fashion 
if we were not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner in the future  we may be subject to lawsuits or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
in any event  we expect that we will continue to incur significant expenses and diversion of management s time to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section l we may face significant business and financial risk from claims of intellectual property infringement asserted against us  and we may be unable to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we are notified from time to time of claims that we may be infringing patents owned by others 
as we sometimes have in the past  we may obtain licenses under patents that we are alleged to infringe 
although patent holders commonly offer licenses to alleged infringers  we may not be offered a license for patents that we are alleged to infringe or we may not find the terms of any offered licenses acceptable 
we may not be able to resolve any claim of infringement  and the resolution of any claim may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
our failure to resolve any claim of infringement could result in litigation or arbitration 
we are currently involved in an arbitration with btr see business patents and licenses 
in addition  we have agreed to defend our customers from and indemnify them against claims that our products infringe the patent or other intellectual rights of third parties 
all litigation and arbitration proceedings  whether or not determined in our favor  can result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any litigation or arbitration involving intellectual property  we could suffer significant and possibly treble monetary damages  which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
we may also be required to discontinue the use of infringing processes  cease the manufacture  use  and sale or licensing of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or obtain licenses under patents that we are infringing 
in the event of a successful claim against us  our failure to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could also have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
we have devoted significant resources to research and development and believe that the intellectual property derived from such research and development is a valuable asset important to the success of our business 
we rely primarily on patent  trademark  and copyright laws combined with nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which our products 
table of contents are developed  manufactured  or sold  including asia and europe  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
our failure to enforce our patents  trademarks  or copyrights or to protect our trade secrets could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
l we may be unable to attract or retain the personnel necessary to successfully develop our technologies  design our products  or operate  manage  or grow our business 
our success is dependent in large part on our ability to attract and retain key managerial  engineering  marketing  sales  and support employees 
particularly important are highly skilled design  process  software  and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the failure to recruit employees with the necessary technical or other skills or the loss of key employees could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
from time to time we have experienced growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations  resulting in increased responsibilities for management personnel 
to manage future growth effectively  we will need to attract  hire  train  motivate  manage  and retain a growing number of employees 
during strong business cycles  we expect to experience difficulty in filling our needs for qualified engineers and other personnel 
any failure to attract and retain qualified employees  or to manage our growth effectively  could delay product development and introductions or otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
l we have some arrangements that may not be neutral toward a potential change of control and our board of directors could adopt others 
we have adopted an employee retention plan that provides for payment of a benefit to our employees who hold unvested stock options or restricted stock units rsus in the event of a change of control 
payment is contingent upon the employee remaining employed for six months after the change of control unless the employee is terminated without cause during the six months 
each of our executive officers has also entered into a management continuity agreement  which provides for the acceleration of stock options and rsus unvested at the time of a change of control in the event the executive officer s employment is actually or constructively terminated other than for cause following the change of control 
while these arrangements are intended to make executive officers and other employees neutral towards a potential change of control  they could have the effect of biasing some or all executive officers or employees in favor of a change of control 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights  and preferences determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board is empowered  without approval by holders of our common stock  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  redemption  conversion  voting  or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
issuance of preferred stock could be used to discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control 
in addition  issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on october   our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan 
under the plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  the provisions of the plan can be triggered only in certain limited circumstances following the tenth day after a person or group announces acquisitions of  or tender offers for  or more of our common stock 
the shareholder rights plan is designed to guard against partial tender offers and other coercive tactics to gain control of actel without offering a fair and adequate price and terms to 
table of contents all shareholders 
nevertheless  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire actel  even if our shareholders support the acquisition 
l our stock price may decline significantly  possibly for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock markets broadly  technology companies generally  and our common stock in particular have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially on the basis of many factors  including quarterly fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of our competitors or other semiconductor companies  changes in the expectations of analysts regarding our financial results or the financial results of our competitors or other semiconductor companies  announcements of new products or technical innovations by actel or by our competitors  or general conditions in the semiconductor industry  financial markets  or economy 
l if our stock price declines sufficiently  we would write down our goodwill  which may have a materially adverse affect on our operating results 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the two step impairment test identifies potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we are a single reporting unit under sfas no 
 so we use the enterprise approach to compare fair value with book value 
since the best evidence of fair value is quoted market prices in active markets  we use our market capitalization as the basis for the measurement 
as long as our market capitalization is greater than our book value and we remain a single reporting unit  our goodwill will be considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test will be unnecessary 
if our market capitalization were to fall below our book value  we would proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment test  which measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of our goodwill 
as long as we remain a single reporting entity  we believe that the difference between the implied fair value of our goodwill and the carrying amount of our goodwill would equal the difference between our market capitalization and our book value 
accordingly  if our market capitalization fell below our book value and we remained a single reporting unit  we expect that we would write down our goodwill  and recognize a goodwill impairment loss  equal to the difference between our market capitalization and our book value

during the fourth quarter of we incurred incremental charges included in cost of revenues of million for expenses associated with the testing of the rtsx s space qualified fpgas and the write down of rtsx s inventory from the original manufacturer 
beginning in  we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
instead  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests and written down only when identified as impaired 
non goodwill intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized under sfas no 
and see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the purpose of this overview is to provide context for the discussion and analysis of our financial statements that follows by briefly summarizing the most important known trends and uncertainties  as well as the key performance indicators  on which our executives are primarily focused for both the short and long term 
we design  develop  and market fpgas and pscs and supporting products and services 
fpgas are programmable logic devices plds that adapt the processing and memory capabilities of electronic systems to specific applications 
pscs are programmable system on a chip integrated circuits that contain all of the necessary hardware and electronic circuitry for a complete system 
pscs and fpgas are used by designers of automotive  communications  computer  consumer  industrial  military and aerospace  and other electronic systems to differentiate their products and get them to market faster 
we are the leading supplier of fpgas based on flash and antifuse technologies and believe that we are the leading supplier of high reliability fpgas and the first supplier to offer a truly programmable psc 
semiconductors according to the semiconductor industry association sia  worldwide sales of semiconductors rose to a record billion in  up from the previous record of billion in before that  the previous industry peak of billion was reached in  followed by a drop of to billion in while the setback in was of extraordinary proportions  the semiconductor industry has always been cyclical and it appears that the drop was consistent with the historical pattern of contraction after a period of significant growth 
it is possible  though  that the industry has matured to the point where it will no longer be able to achieve the long term growth rates it has experienced in the past 
logic according to sia  worldwide sales of digital logic ics were billion in  of which asics accounted for billion 
asics include conventional gate arrays  standard cells  and plds 
as they have gotten faster and cheaper over the last decade  plds have gained a sizeable share of the asic market 
we believe that this long term trend will continue because customers are willing to forego some of the price and performance advantages of hard wired asics in order to obtain the time to market as well as the design and manufacturing flexibility benefits of plds 
plds plds include simple plds  cplds  and fpgas 
fpgas have gained share in the pld market because they generally offer greater capacity  lower total cost per usable logic gate  and lower power consumption than simple plds and cplds 
we believe that this long term trend will continue 
our three larger competitors  xilinx  altera  and lattice  offer cplds as well as fpgas 
strategy as the fourth biggest vendor in the fpga market  we do not believe that we can compete across the board  but must choose technologies and markets in which to differentiate ourselves 
our strategy involves considerable risk 
unique technologies and products can take years to develop  if at all  and markets that we target may fail to emerge 
we have at times faltered in these areas 
still  we believe that our strategic positioning is the best it has ever been in our history  in part because during we offered the first soft core fpga version of the industry standard arm processor and became the first entrant into the psc market 
we are currently targeting our flash based fpgas at the value based fpga market  which is driven by cost effectiveness  our antifuse based fpgas at the system critical fpga market  which is driven primarily by reliability and security  and our new flash based mixed signal analog and digital actel fusion devices at the psc market 
technologies our flash and antifuse technologies are non volatile  so they retain their circuit configuration even in the absence of power 
in contrast to the sram and other memory technologies used by our larger competitors  our fpgas don t need a separate boot device  are live at power up  generally require less power  and offer practically unbreakable design security 

table of contents antifuse the one time programmability of our antifuse fpgas is desirable in certain military and aerospace applications  but commercial customers generally prefer to use reprogrammable fpgas  and fpgas based on all other types of technologies are reprogrammable 
in addition  we are the only sizeable company that uses antifuse technology  which means that we bear the entire burden of developing and proving antifuse processes including yields and reliability and products including switching elements and architectures 
it also means that our fgpas using antifuse technology are at least one and often two generations behind the fpgas of our competitors using sram and other technologies manufactured on standard processes 
flash we believe that our long term future lies with flash technology  which permits us to make fpgas that are both non volatile and reprogrammable 
while our flash technology is unique  the process is very similar to the standard embedded flash memory process  so we will be able to share with others most of the burden of developing and proving the process 
while flash technology has trailed sram technology by only about one half of a generation  our flash fpgas are still at least one generation behind the sram fpgas of our competitors 
we were the first company to sell flash based fpgas  but altera and lattice corporation have since announced the development of plds manufactured on embedded flash processes 
however  the altera and lattice plds still employ sram based architectures  with the embedded flash memory blocks controlling only the initial configuration of the devices during power up  so they cannot offer the full advantages of flash technology already provided by our fpgas 
markets the inherent advantages of our non volatile technologies give us a big advantage with some groups of customers  but are of little or no value to others 
psc beginning with the invention of the integrated circuit in  the most fundamental trend in the history of the semiconductor industry has been increasing integration 
for all types of integrated circuits  whether analog  logic  memory  or processor  this initially meant increasing the capacity of the chip 
eventually  however  all types of integrated circuits achieve capacities that satisfy the requirements of most customers 
to continue integrating  it then becomes necessary to add more functions 
an example is hard wired asics  which like fpgas  are logic integrated circuits 
by the late s  asics had enough logic gates for most electronic system designers  so asics with embedded analog  memory  and or processor functions proliferated 
we believe that fpgas will follow the same path 
today  few fpga designs push the maximum capacity limits of fpgas  so offering more logic gates provides little value to most electronic system designers 
what they want is more functions  and a typical low cost system today has an analog interface  a flash memory  an fpga  and a processor  which might be as simple as a state machine or as complicated as an arm processor 
so that s what we developed in the actel fusion psc an analog block  a flash memory  an fpga  and a soft processor on a single chip 
by leveraging the most fundamental trend in the history of the semiconductor industry  we are highly confident that many customers will value the opportunity to get all of these functions on a single chip at a reasonable price 
we expect that our psc products  as a new class of integrated circuit  will generate extraordinary challenges as well as extraordinary opportunities 
the initial psc products were available for sampling near the end of  and we re very excited about the future of this product family 
value based we think that the value based market  which is primarily concerned about cost  will grow the most of any fpga market segment and is the best fit for our flash technology 
during  we introduced the proasic and proasice families  our third generation of flash based programmable logic solutions  which are targeted specifically at the value based fgpa market 
we also introduced arm enabled m proasic e fpgas  which made the arm processor available to the masses without the royalties or upfront licensing fees typically required 
xilinx and altera are also aggressively offering low priced products  so we might not gain share even in this segment of the fpga market  but we re optimistic because we think these customers most value the advantages of our flash technology 
we have in the past been a late entrant to markets in which we were technologically disadvantaged  but in serving the value based market with flash based plds  we believe that we are an early entrant with technical advantages 
selling more low price products may make it more difficult to maintain our gross margins from quarter to quarter 
system critical 
table of contents we believe that we are the world s leading supplier of military  avionics  and space grade fpgas 
this is a market in which the customers are extremely conscientious and demand the very highest levels of quality and reliability 
to that end  we have conducted analysis of and experiments on the reliability of our rtsx s and rtsx su space qualified fpgas for more than two years at the behest of an ad hoc industry group 
the activities of the ad hoc industry group have now been brought to a close  although testing will continue see the risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report on form k for more information 
during  we revealed to the military and aerospace engineers industry our product roadmap  which includes the first flash based fpga for space applications 
as part of our ongoing effort to support the military and aerospace markets  we will continue to develop military temperature versions of our commercial products 
our general philosophy is to develop and deliver products to our commercial customer base and then enhance those products for our military and aerospace customers 
however  with the benefit of funding from the united states government which we believe will be in the range of to million for  we are attempting to develop a radiation hardened version of our fourth generation flash based fpga architecture concurrently with the development of the commercial version 
our roadmap also included two additions to our antifuse based families the  system gate rhaxs device  a radiation hardened rh fpga based on our existing rtaxs device  and the  system gate rtaxs device  the highest density radiation tolerant rt fpga for space designs 
like our rh and rh devices  which have been discontinued see the risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report on form k for more information  the rhaxs fpga will be manufactured by bae systems at an rh foundry in manassas  virginia 
since they are expected to be manufactured entirely within the continental united states  the rhaxs fpgas will comply with the trusted foundry initiative recently established by the us department of defense 
unlike our rtsx su devices  which serve only the low or glue logic end of the high reliability market  our rtax s fpgas will also serve the high or asic replacement end of the high reliability market  which we think is several times larger than the low end of the market 
also unlike our rtsx su devices  the new rtax s fpgas are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations  which impose more stringent export controls see the risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report on form k for more information 
software is available today for users to begin designing with the rhaxs and rtaxs products  and delivery of production parts is planned by the end of  which fits pretty well with a typical design cycle 
since rhaxs has at least ten times the capacity of the largest member of existing rh family and the rtaxs has at least ten times the capacity of the largest member of the existing rtsx su family  we believe that we will be able expand our share of the aerospace and defense market over the next several years despite the rtsx s investigations  the discontinuation of the rh and rh products  and the more stringent export controls 
key indicators although we measure the condition and performance of our business in numerous ways  the key quantitative indicators that we generally use to manage the business are bookings  design wins  margins  yields  and backlog 
we also carefully monitor the progress of our product development efforts 
of these  we think that bookings and backlog are the best indicators of short term performance and that designs wins and product development progress are the best indicators of long term performance 
our bookings measured as end customer orders placed on us and our distributors were higher during than during  and our backlog was higher at the end of than at the end of our design wins were higher in than in  with most of the growth coming in flash 
our product development progress was exceptionally strong  particularly on the actel fusion pscs 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development selling  general  and administrative amortization of acquisition related intangibles income loss from operations interest income and other  net of expense gain on sales of equity investments income before tax provision benefit tax benefit provision net income our fiscal year ends on the first sunday after december fiscal ended on january   fiscal ended on january   and fiscal ended on january  for ease of presentation  december has been indicated as the year end for all fiscal years 
net revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of fpgas  which accounted for of net revenues in   and non fpga revenues are derived from our protocol design services organization  royalties  and the licensing of software and sale of hardware used to design and program our fpgas 
we believe that we derived more than of our revenues in   and from sales of fpgas to customers serving the military and aerospace and the communications markets 
we have experienced  and may again in the future experience  substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to conditions in each of these markets as well as in the general economy 
net revenues in were million  an increase over this increase was due primarily to an increase in the overall average selling price asp of fpgas and a slight increase in the total number of units shipped in the year 
the overall asp increased principally because we derived a higher percentage of our revenues from our radiation hardened and radiation tolerant products which have higher asps than other product families 
net revenues in were higher than in this increase was due primarily to a increase in the number of units shipped offset by a decline in the overall asp of fpgas 
the increase in units shipped was driven by our new products  which include proasic plus  rtsx s  sx a  ex and ax 
the overall asp declined principally because we derived a higher percentage of our revenues from our newer product families  which typically have lower asps than their predecessors 
we shipped approximately of our net revenues through the distribution sales channel in  compared with in and in since  memec  unique has been our sole distributor in north america 
on april   avnet  inc avnet and memec group holdings ltd 
memec announced they had reached a definitive agreement for avnet to acquire memec in a stock and cash transaction 
on july   avnet announced the completion of its acquisition of memec  unique 
we generally do not recognize revenue on product shipped to a distributor until the distributor resells the product to its customer 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of net revenues in  in  and in the largest portion of export sales was to european customers  which accounted for of net revenues in  in  and in gross margin gross margin was of revenues in compared with in and in gross margin in benefited from a product mix that contained a higher percentage of radiation products as a percentage of total  which typically generate higher 
table of contents gross margins 
gross margin in was unfavorably impacted by a million write down we recorded in the fourth quarter 
this charge included a write down of million of rtsx s inventory from the original manufacturer for which we determined there was no demand 
in addition  million of the charge was a write off of certain boards and sockets  purchased solely to test the rtsx s units  that have no future use to us in the production process 
see the risk factors set forth at the end of item i of this annual report on form k for more information about the investigations regarding the reliability of our rtsx s space qualified fpgas 
we also experienced some pressure on gross margin in due to a higher concentration of our newer products  as a percentage of total revenue  which tend to have lower gross margins than our more mature products 
we expect to continue to see some pressure on our gross margins as our product mix continues to shift to our newer product families 
gross margin is affected by changes in excess and slow moving inventory write downs 
gross margin was positively impacted in by the sell through of previously written down inventory of million or approximately 
gross margin was positively impacted by the sell through of previously written down inventory of million  or in and million  or in we seek to reduce costs and improve gross margins by improving wafer yields  negotiating price reductions with suppliers  increasing the level and efficiency of our testing and packaging operations  achieving economies of scale by means of higher production levels  and increasing the number of die produced per wafer  principally by shrinking the die size of our products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
our capability to shrink the die size of our fpgas is dependent on the availability of more advanced manufacturing processes 
due to the custom steps involved in manufacturing antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas  we typically obtain access to new manufacturing processes later than our competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
research and development r d r d expenditures were million  or of net revenues  in compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in r d expenditures increased million in due to our expanded efforts and increased headcount needed to concurrently research and develop future commercial and radiation tolerant generations of both flash and antifuse based product families 
r d spending as a percentage of revenue in was basically flat in each of the years  and our r d consists of circuit design  software development  and process technology activities 
we believe that continued substantial investment in r d is critical to maintaining a strong technological position in the industry 
since our antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas are manufactured using customized processes that require a substantial time to develop  our r d expenditures will probably always be higher as a percentage of net revenues than that of our major competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a expenses in were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in sg a expenses in increased by million from primarily as a result of higher selling expense associated with increased net revenues  higher legal costs associated with general business issues and employment matters and increased marketing expense related to new product offerings 
sg a spending in decreased slightly as a percentage of sales over levels 
this was the result of higher revenue levels in  even though absolute spending in increased 
based on anticipated levels of legal activity in we expect legal spending to increase further over spending levels incurred in sg a expenses in increased by million compared with primarily as a result of higher selling expense associated with increased net revenues  the first company wide salary increases since  and additional spending of approximately million related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sg a spending in decreased slightly as a percentage of sales over levels 
this was the result of higher revenue levels in  even though absolute spending in increased 
amortization of other acquisition related intangibles amortization of other acquisition related intangibles was million in and million in and we implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of sfas no 

table of contents interest income and other  net of expense interest income and other  net of expense  was million in  million in  and million in for  our average investment portfolio return on investment was compared with in and in the lower interest rates in and were primarily the reason that interest income and other were lower in those years 
our average investment portfolio balance was million in compared with million in and million in we invest excess liquidity in investment portfolios consisting primarily of corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
in periods where market interest rates are falling  and for some time after rates stabilize  we typically experience declines in interest income and other as our older debt investments at higher interest rates mature and are replaced by new investments at the lower rates available in the market 
tax provision benefit significant components affecting the effective tax rate include pre tax net income or loss  federal r d tax credits  income from tax exempt securities  the state composite tax rate  and recognition of certain deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowances 
our tax provision for was million based upon a annual effective tax rate 
this rate was calculated based on a statutory tax rate benefited by r d tax credits and state tax benefits 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in resulting from the combined effect of a small pre tax income offset by r d tax credits and state tax benefits 
our tax provision for was million  which represents an effective tax rate of for the year 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources our total assets were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase in total assets was attributable principally to increases in cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and other assets 
the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated balance sheets expressed as a percentage change from december   to december  
table of contents cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments accounts receivable  net inventories current deferred income taxes prepaid expenses and other current assets long term investments property and equipment  net other assets  net primarily deferred income taxes and purchased intangible assets other than goodwill total assets total current liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity cash  cash equivalents  and investments our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at the end of compared with million at the end of this increase of million from the end of was due primarily to million of net cash provided by operating activities  million of cash provided by financing activities million used to repurchase actel common stock netted against million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and million provided from a reduction of available for sale securities classified as long term investments  which were partially offset by million of cash used to purchase property and equipment 
the significant components within operating activities that provided cash during included million from net income for the year  million from a decrease in inventory and a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors adjusted for non cash items million of which relates to depreciation and amortization 
the significant components within operating activities that resulted in a reduction of cash from operations in included an million increase in accounts receivable 
spending on property and equipment amounted to million in compared with million in our capital budget for is million 
cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans amounted to million in  million in  and million in the increase in employee stock plan activity that occurred in was mostly driven by the increase in the market price of our common stock  which had an average closing price per share of in  in  and in employee stock activity was especially heavy during the last six months of  when the average closing price was per share 
we meet all of our funding needs for ongoing operations with internally generated cash flows from operations and with existing cash and short term investment balances 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for a portion of available cash may be used for investment in or acquisition of complementary businesses  products  or technologies 
wafer manufacturers have at times demanded financial support from customers in the form of equity investments and advance purchase price deposits  which in some cases have been substantial 
should we require additional capacity  we may be required to incur significant expenditures to secure such capacity 
the following represents contractual commitments not accrued on the balance sheet associated with operating leases as of december  payments due by period total and later in thousands operating leases purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant 
table of contents terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we believe that the availability of adequate financial resources is a substantial competitive factor 
to take advantage of opportunities as they arise  or to withstand adverse business conditions when they occur  it may become prudent or necessary for us to raise additional capital 
no assurance can be given that additional capital would become available on acceptable terms if needed 
accounts receivable our net accounts receivable was million at the end of compared with million at the end of this increase was due primarily to the non linearity of sales in the fourth quarter of  with approximately of the quarterly revenue shipping in the last month of the quarter compared to the linearity of sales in the fourth quarter of  which allowed us to collect a higher percentage of the quarters receivables prior to year end 
net accounts receivable represented days of sales outstanding at the end of compared with days at the end of inventories our net inventories were million at the end of compared with million at the end of we continue to hold material from last time buy inventory purchases made in and from two wafer manufacturers for some of our mature product families 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and we believe that the then current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions is evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
inventory at december   included million of inventory purchased in last time buys 
inventory days of supply increased from days at the end of to days at the end of days of inventory were reduced at the end of due to the higher cost of sales associated with the million of write downs recorded in the fourth quarter of our fpgas are manufactured using customized steps that are added to the standard manufacturing processes of our independent wafer suppliers  so our manufacturing cycle is generally longer and more difficult to adjust in response to changing demands or delivery schedules than our competitors using standard processes 
accordingly  our inventory levels will probably always be higher than that of our major competitors using standard processes 
property and equipment our net property and equipment was million at the end of compared with million at the end of we invested million in property and equipment in compared with million in capital expenditures during the past two years have been primarily for engineering  manufacturing  and office equipment 
depreciation of property and equipment was million in compared with million in goodwill our net goodwill was million at the end of both and goodwill is recorded when consideration paid in an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
at the beginning of  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
under sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairments tests during the fourth quarter of  and noted no indicators of impairment 
other assets our other assets  net were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase was due primarily to a million increase in the capitalization of technology license agreements offset by million amortization of identified intangible assets 

table of contents current liabilities our total current liabilities were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase was due primarily to the capitalization of certain long term royalty agreements of million and a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
shareholders equity shareholders equity was million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase in included proceeds of million from the sale of common stock under employee stock plans and net income of million  which were offset by stock repurchases of million and unrealized losses from short term investments of million 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november   the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by actel in the first quarter of fiscal actel is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning in the first quarter of for calendar year companies 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt it requirements using various methods  including the modified prospective application method and the modified retrospective application method 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on actel s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
please refer to note stock based compensation of our consolidated financial statements which provides historical information that may be useful in assessing the impact of this standard on our operating results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas replaces apb no 
and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes in the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of change a cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle whereas sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable 
sfas enhances the consistency of financial information between periods 
sfas will be effective beginning with the company s first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect that sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial 
table of contents condition and results and also require us to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based upon this definition  our most critical policies include inventories  income taxes  legal matters and revenue recognition 
these policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  are discussed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or they are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  it could result in material expenses being recognized on the income statement 
inventories we believe that a certain level of inventory must be carried to maintain an adequate supply of product for customers 
this inventory level may vary based upon orders received from customers or internal forecasts of demand for these products 
other considerations in determining inventory levels include the stage of products in the product life cycle  design win activity  manufacturing lead times  customer demands  strategic relationships with foundries  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
should any of these factors develop other than anticipated  inventory levels may be materially and adversely affected 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
to address this difficult  subjective  and complex area of judgment  we apply a methodology that includes assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net realizable value 
first  we identify any inventory that has been previously written down in prior periods 
this inventory remains written down until sold  destroyed  or otherwise dispositioned 
second  we examine inventory line items that may have some form of non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards 
third  we assess the inventory not otherwise identified to be written down against product history and forecasted demand typically for the next six months 
finally  we analyze the result of this methodology in light of the product life cycle  design win activity  and competitive situation in the marketplace to derive an outlook for consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during we wrote down million of inventory related to our rtsx s product from the original manufacturer for which we determined there was no demand 
during  we modified our inventory valuation policies to properly account for last time buy inventory purchases 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and we believe that our then current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
we made last time buys of certain products from our wafer suppliers in and since this inventory was not acquired to meet current demand  we did not believe the application of our existing inventory write down policy was appropriate  so a discrete write down policy was established for inventory purchased in last time buy transactions 
as a consequence  these transactions and the related inventory are excluded from the standard excess and obsolescence write down policy 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions will be evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products over a longer time horizon  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
evaluations of last time buy inventory in resulted in a write down of million of material this write down was taken because actual sell through results did not meet expectations or estimations of expected future demand 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and  if necessary  we adjust the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we assessed our deferred tax assets at the end of and determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize approximately million of net deferred tax assets based upon our forecast of future taxable income and other relevant factors 

table of contents legal matters and loss contingencies from time to time we are notified of claims  including claims that we may be infringing patents owned by others  or otherwise become aware of conditions  situations  or circumstances involving uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or the amount of a loss 
when probable and reasonably estimable  we make provisions for estimated liabilities 
as we sometimes have in the past  we may settle disputes and or obtain licenses under patents that we are alleged to infringe 
we can offer no assurance that any pending or threatened claim or other loss contingency will be resolved or that the resolution of any such claim or contingency will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
our failure to resolve a claim could result in litigation or arbitration  which can result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not determined in our favor 
we are currently involved in an arbitration with btr  inc  under a license agreement between the parties 
in addition  our evaluation of the impact of these claims and contingencies could change based upon new information 
subject to the foregoing  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened legal claim or loss contingency is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position at january   or results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year to date period then ended 
revenues we sell our products to oems and to distributors who resell our products to oems or their contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on products sold to oems upon shipment 
because sales to distributors are generally made under agreements allowing for price adjustments  credits  and right of return under certain circumstances  we generally defer recognition of revenue on products sold to distributors until the products are resold 
deferred income and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded in the caption deferred income on shipments to distributors in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been resold 
this reported information includes product resale price  quantity  and end customer information as well as inventory balances on hand 
our revenue reporting is dependant on us receiving timely and accurate data from our distributors 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data from our distributors and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventory and sell through activities 
risks our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and a variety of risks characteristic of the semiconductor industry or specific to us  including booking and shipment uncertainties  wafer supply fluctuations  and price erosion  any of which could cause our operating results to differ materially from past results 
see the risk factors set forth at the end of item of this annual report on form k 
quarterly information the table on the next page presents certain unaudited quarterly results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  in our opinion  this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k and all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring accruals have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
however  these quarterly operating results are not indicative of the results for any future period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  meet liquidity needs  and maximize yields 
to meet these objectives  we invest excess liquidity only in high credit quality debt securities with average maturities of less than two years 
we also limit the percentage of total investments that may be invested in any one issuer 
corporate investments as a group are also limited to a maximum percentage of our investment portfolio 
our debt security investments  which totaled million at december   are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase in interest rates could subject us to a decline in the market value of our investments 
these risks are mitigated by our ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to recover the carrying value of the investment which may not be until maturity 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates compared with interest rates at december   and december   would result in a reduction of approximately million in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities held at december   and december  the potential changes noted above are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position and expected operating levels at december  actual results may differ materially
