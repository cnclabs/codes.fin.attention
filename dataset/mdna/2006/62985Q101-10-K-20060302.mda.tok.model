impact of the acquisition and related financing transactions on november   pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between nalco holdings llc  a delaware limited liability company  and suez suez and certain of its affiliates  nalco holdings llc the successor acquired the net assets of ondeo nalco group the predecessor 
the aggregate purchase price was  million in cash  after giving effect to direct costs of the acquisition  closing date working capital and indebtedness purchase price adjustments  a post closing working capital and indebtedness purchase price adjustment which was agreed to by us and suez on march   and additional purchase price adjustments related to taxes paid or tax refunds received by us for periods prior to the acquisition 
the purchase price was financed by equity investments totaling million from a consortium of private equity funds controlled by the blackstone group  apollo management  lp  and investment partnerships affiliated with the goldman sachs group  inc  an equity investment of million from dr 
william h 
joyce  our chairman and chief executive officer  term loans of approximately  million  and the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due as a result  our interest expense currently is  and will continue to be  higher than it was prior to the acquisition 
the stock purchase agreement provided for certain adjustments of the purchase price  including adjustments based on the closing working capital and indebtedness as both are defined in the stock purchase agreement of ondeo nalco group at the date of the acquisition 
on march   the company and suez agreed to a million working capital adjustment payable to the company plus interest 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the acquisition resulted in a new basis of accounting for us 
we allocated the purchase price on the basis of our estimate of the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we retained third party professionals to assist in the determination of a fair value of our pension and post retirement obligations 
we also engaged independent appraisers to assist in determining the fair values of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired  including purchased in process research and development  trade names  trademarks  developed technology and customer relationships 
we received final values from the appraisers in  and we completed our allocation of purchase price 
the excess of the total purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired at closing was allocated to goodwill  and this indefinite lived asset is subject to annual impairment review 
goodwill in the transaction  based on the final allocation of the purchase price  totaled  million 
an allocation was made for the fair value of research and development activities that  as of the date of the acquisition  had commenced  but had not yet been completed  and have no alternative future use in process research and development 
in conjunction with the independent appraisers  we estimated the fair value of in process research and development and recorded a one time charge of million during the year ended december  as a result of the final purchase accounting entries related to the acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we formulated a plan to exit or restructure certain activities 
we recorded liabilities of million  primarily for employee severance and related costs  in connection with our plan to exit or restructure certain activities 
as of december   million has been charged against this accrual 
we expect that we will complete these activities by mid business optimization expenses we incurred significant  nonrecurring business optimization expenses as a result of the implementation of the redesign and optimization of business and work processes  global cost reduction programs in sales  marketing  manufacturing and support service functions  and the global integration of our businesses  as follows

critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition non contract billings 
we use a variety of shipping terms that determine the passage of title for our products 
we have a policy of monitoring delivery terms and cut off dates to ensure that revenue is properly recorded 
in specific cases  when title passage is based upon ultimate receipt by the customer fob destination using a third party carrier  it is necessary to estimate the delivery time and the corresponding impact on revenue recognition 
we issue credit memos for a variety of reasons  including product returns  billing and price adjustments 
the credit memos are often related to a previous billing event and may impact the amount of revenue recorded 
we monitor credit memo activity levels and include an estimate as a component of the revenue recognition reserve 
contract billings 
contract billings are also reviewed as part of the revenue recognition process to align the periodic billings with services performed 
impairment of long lived assets other than intangibles we conduct periodic reviews for idle equipment and review business plans for possible impairment implications 
porta feed stainless steel containers  utilized to ship chemicals  represent approximately of our property  plant and equipment and are managed globally to optimize the delivery of chemicals to customer and company sites around the world 
due to their high mobility  there is a risk that porta feeds could be damaged or lost in transit 
we perform continuous cycle counts of our porta feeds and when such counts are inconsistent with our tracking system  we investigate the discrepancy in order to locate the container 
if the porta feed is not found  we write off the asset immediately 
we capitalize qualifying costs incurred in the acquisition and development of software for internal use  including the costs of the software  materials  consultants  interest  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees dedicated to the development 
we must use our judgment in determining whether the direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and an employee s time and travel expenses directly associated with developing software are recoverable and should be capitalized 
we base our determination on the nature and the extent of the activity that the employee is performing 
a significant portion of our capitalized software costs relates to our sap implementation 
goodwill and other intangible assets carrying values of goodwill  customer relationships  trademarks  trade names  patents  developed technology and other intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment using a discounted cash flow approach 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken 
future outcomes may also differ 
if we fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  experience unfavorable market conditions or achieve results that differ from our estimates  then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
pensions accounting for pensions involves the selection of a discount rate and an expected rate of return that we apply to a market related value of plan assets 
this methodology generally reduces the volatility of pension expense that would have otherwise resulted from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that are expected to be available through the maturity dates of the pension benefits and receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency  and we review the assumption with our actuary 
the assets in the principal domestic pension plan are diversified across equity and fixed income investments 
the investment portfolio has target allocations of approximately equity and fixed income 
other assets such as real estate  hedge funds and private equity may be used judiciously to enhance portfolio returns and diversification 
the expected long term rate of return is established using historical market data for each asset class as well as the target allocation 
historical markets are analyzed and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income investments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility will generate a greater return over the long run 
active management is employed in most asset classes  which also contributes to the return assumption 
the total weighted average return on each asset class supports our long term expected rate of return assumption 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually through comparison of our historical actual rates of return with our expectations  consultation with our actuaries regarding the assumptions used by other large companies and consultation with our investment managers regarding their expectations for future returns 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years in determining pension expense 
the net effect of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience has been deferred historically 
as a result of the acquisition and the application of purchase accounting  all unamortized deferrals were eliminated as of the date of the acquisition 
other postretirement benefits accounting for other postretirement benefits requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency and we review the assumption with our actuary 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
income taxes the company estimates its income tax consequences in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this results in recording deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet to recognize the temporary differences caused by the timing of recognition of income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
valuation allowances are determined based on the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
relevant factors to determine the realizability of the assets include future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 
valuation allowances are established for those assets that are determined to be more likely than not to expire without benefit  or for which income of the proper character is not anticipated 
the effect of a valuation allowance expected to be necessary for a deferred tax asset at the end of the year for originating deductible temporary differences and carryforwards are included in the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the effect of a change in the beginning of the year balance of a valuation allowance resulting from a change in judgement about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
the tax positions taken by the company are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal  state and international jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations  and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken 
however  these positions are subject to audit and review by the tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations  we have reserved tax contingencies including related interest for positions that we consider the likelihood of being sustained to be less than probable 
the tax reserves are reevaluated throughout the year  taking into account new legislation  regulations  case law and audit results 
environmental our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use and handling of hazardous substances  waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services  some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party  or prp  by the environmental protection agency or state enforcement agencies at three waste sites where some financial contribution is or may be required 
these agencies have also identified many other parties who may be responsible for clean up costs at the waste disposal sites 
our financial contribution to remediate these sites is expected to be minor 
there has been no significant financial impact on us up to the present  nor is it anticipated that there will be in the future  as a result of these matters 
we have made and will continue to make provisions for these costs if our liability becomes probable and when costs can be reasonably estimated 
our operations at garyville  louisiana are the subject of a civil and criminal investigation by the united states environmental protection agency and us department of justice which has included interviews with current and former employees and document subpoenas 
we believe the investigation may relate to the storage of used acid and leakage from a wastewater treatment tank  but could include other matters 
we do not believe that any material contamination resulted from this storage and leakage 
although we believe a grand jury has not been empanelled and we would vigorously contest any criminal claims against us  we cannot predict the outcome of this investigation 
we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances  including multi party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services 
while we do not believe that based upon present information that any of these suits will be material to us  there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
historically  our expenditures relating to environmental compliance and clean up activities have not been significant 
the environmental reserves represent our current estimate of our proportional clean up costs and are based upon negotiation and agreement with enforcement agencies  our previous experience with respect to clean up activities  detailed review of known conditions  and information about other prps 
the reserves are not reduced by any possible recoveries from insurance companies or other prps not specifically identified 
although given the evolving nature of environmental regulations  we cannot determine whether or not a material effect on future operations is reasonably likely to occur  we believe that the recorded reserve levels are appropriate estimates of the potential liability 
although settlements will require future cash outlays  it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position  although there can be no assurance that such impacts could not occur 
executive level overview despite the difficult challenges of raw material costs increases and shortages  coupled with unusually disruptive hurricanes  we managed to grow sales and earnings in while generating cash to pay down debt 
absorbing the number of challenges we faced while improving results and generating cash shows the strength of our service oriented business 
in  we increased sales to billion and improved net income to million from a year ago net loss of million 
fully diluted earnings per share were in compared to the prior year net loss of per share 
performance improvements did not come easily 
the year put a tremendous strain on our employees  who worked harder than ever to keep supply disruptions and other challenges from impacting the services  products and expertise we provide to customers 
the financial results from this hard work fell short of both our internal expectations and variable incentive plan targets 
cost savings played an important role in helping the company improve its results 
for the year  structural cost savings and work process redesign efforts generated million in benefits to offset higher compensation costs  investments in selling and research  and other cost increases beyond purchased materials and freight 
our performance gap versus original expectations was caused primarily by hurricane based costs of approximately million  large purchased material and freight cost increases and our usual lag in obtaining price increases 
increased energy and material costs totaled about million in  versus price increases for the year of nearly million 
although we obtained price increases in the fourth quarter higher than year on year cost increases  we clearly have more work to do in to capture enough in price increases to match our higher costs over the past months 
in  costs were up million over the prior year 
price increases played a key role in our organic sales growth in real growth was up as sales engineers focused in the year on increasing price  resulting in improvement 
we define real growth as organic growth minus price increases designed to pass on higher purchased material and energy costs 
from nominal sales growth of  organic growth excludes in currency fluctuations and a increase from the june creation of a joint venture in japan 
sales increased organically by in energy services  in industrial and institutional services  in paper services and in our other segment  supported by very strong growth in india 
nominal sales in the other segment increased  gaining from five months of sales consolidation from creation of the katayama nalco joint venture in japan 
our energy services business continues to deliver strong results  despite substantial lost sales in the gulf of mexico following hurricanes katrina  rita and dennis 
although our customers had initially expected to have nearly all gulf operations running by the end of  we now expect it to be at least mid year before these operations are fully restored 
our oil field business overall grew strongly in we also saw very strong results in our downstream refining and petrochemical business  aided by strong performance of our d trasar cooling water stress management program 
we achieved the greatest level of pricing success in the industrial and institutional services business 
that success in pricing came at a cost  however  as our sales forces in north america and europe were distracted from focusing as intently on real growth 
as we moved through the year  we improved our pricing skills 
as we move into  clearly gaining focus on generating real growth while continuing to properly capture price is a high priority 
obtaining price improvements has been particularly challenging in paper services 
our paper services business faced a tough customer environment in more importantly  the competitive environment was much slower to respond to cost pressures than in our other segments 
while our asia pacific paper business grew rapidly  this growth was not enough to offset price weakness in our larger north american and european paper business units 
throughout our paper business  we have developed offerings that are better able to drive customer value 
we need to translate this improved customer value into better pricing 
overall  we generated very strong results in china  india  brazil  russia and the other commonwealth of independent states countries  as well as in key segments such as deepwater oil  tissue and towel and membrane treatments 
expansion of our d trasar cooling water stress management program contributed to solid growth in our trasar related cooling water business 
sales in these high growth areas continued to improve as strongly as they did in  even with the impact of hurricanes on our deepwater gulf of mexico business 
the remainder of our business bore the brunt of the unusual market conditions in during  of nalco s sales were in north america  in europe  in asia pacific and in latin america 
asia pacific and latin america grew in their significance within the nalco portfolio 
operations in europe struggled through the year because of both work process and underlying economic health issues 
the combination of improving european economies and process improvements we have made and continue to make should enable our european business to get back to delivering real growth in we generated million in free cash flow for the year  which we applied to debt reduction including million in voluntary reductions of term loan a 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and minority interest charges

outlook even with continued rising raw material costs and slower than projected recovery from the hurricanes  we believe a realistic target for is a near doubling of net income and earnings per share 
this improvement is expected without adding any provision for insurance recovery related to the hurricanes 
from our perspective of the business  our improvement will be good  but not quite as impressive as the projected net income number might suggest 
for comparison  we are targeting a gain of about in adjusted ebitda as defined by our debt covenants from in our forecasts  we are assuming sales growth of about  with more than half of the growth coming from price 
this means that targeted real growth is expected to remain short of the company s longer term base business growth target as efforts to obtain price are expected to continue to be a distraction from generating additional real sales growth 
we are proceeding with our alternate channels program 
all of our early trials look good 
sales growth from alternate channels are not expected to be visible initially  as this growth will be masked by planned declines in some low margin portions of our other segment business 
given the global nature of our business  and the broad cross section of the industries we serve it is reasonable to assume that nalco should minimally grow at a mix of world industrial production and world gross domestic product gdp growth rates 
growth at these rates  however  would leave us somewhat short of our targeted base business growth 
as the cost price environment stabilizes over time  a number of external factors should help us exceed the world gdp industrial production growth pace  and are important to some of the growth drivers we have identified for our business

the higher cost of energy improves the returns that our customers gain from nalco services 
beyond the external factors that impact the size of our opportunity  we should also grow faster than world gdp industrial production by targeting our resources to the right customer segments deepwater oil  tissue and toweling  membrane treatments and many others 
our research and development investments are paying off with strong technology advantages in many industry segments 
our plans also call for year over year costs to rise million  based on the level of cost increases we expect in the first quarter of a majority of this increase was established prior to year end and is carry over impact into in addition to offsetting this expected growth in costs with price increases  we believe we can offset some cost increases in excess of our expectations with higher prices  unless the increases are large or come near the end of the year when we would face our typical lag between incurring cost and capturing price 
for the year  we also expect the following items to impact our earnings and cash flow

in conjunction with the acquisition  suez has agreed to reimburse us for certain profit sharing contributions made by us

the cash flow element we have the most ability to influence is working capital 
we still have a significant amount of improvement in mind as we fix our internal processes in both inventories and receivables 
because many of the process improvements we are working on will not be fully installed until later in  we are not expecting to obtain significant benefits during the year  but these improvements should enable better working capital management as we enter results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  and december  may be compared as follows

net sales for the year ended december  were  million  a increase from the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis  which excludes the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures  net sales were up

the industrial and institutional services division reported organic growth of  the majority of which was attributable to price increases with solid gains  exclusive of price increases  posted by our water treatment business in the latin american and pacific regions  as well as our marine and pacific region mining businesses 
these gains were offset by sales declines  exclusive of price increases  in north america and  more notably  europe 
difficulties in adapting work processes following our sap system conversion in europe on january  and the generally slower economy in our largest western european markets were among the causes of the sales decline in europe 
higher sales during the three months ended december  was another contributing factor  as european customers purchased in advance to avoid risking any potential complications from the system conversion 
solid growth in latin america  rapid growth in the pacific region  and a more modest improvement in north america contributed to the organic growth in paper services division sales 
these improvements were partly offset by lower paper services sales in europe  resulting from labor strikes faced by our finnish customers earlier in the year and the aforementioned factors that affected industrial and institutional services sales in the region 
most of the organic improvement in other sales was attributable to alternate channel sales  our subsidiary company in india  and our japanese joint venture  katayama nalco 
the increase in other sales attributable to acquisitions divestitures represents the incremental impact of sales for the first five months of by katayama nalco  which was formed with katayama chemical inc on june  gross profit  defined as the difference between net sales and cost of product sold  of  million for the year ended december  increased by million  or  over the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis and excluding the impact of a million charge to cost of product sold during the year ended december  resulting from the sale of inventory that had been revalued at selling price less costs to sell in purchase accounting at the date of the acquisition  gross profit decreased by million 
this was primarily attributable to higher costs of raw and other purchased materials  totaling approximately million in  that grew at a faster pace than the impact of increases in the selling prices of our products of nearly million 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ago period 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was reduced approximately basis points as a result of the aforementioned million charge resulting from purchase accounting 
selling  administrative  and research expenses for the year ended december  of  million decreased by million  or  from  million for the year ended december  on an organic basis  selling  administrative  and research expenses decreased by million  or  reflecting significantly lower incentive plan expenses 
this decrease was offset by the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates and the incremental impact of expenses of katayama nalco for the first five months of amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower amortization of customer relationships  which are amortized using an accelerated method 
in process research and development was a one time charge of million recorded during the year ended december   as a result of purchase accounting related to the acquisition 
the value of purchased ipr d was comprised of five ongoing development projects at the date of the acquisition 
purchased ipr d was derived by assigning values to those projects identified by management as having economic value  but that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
business optimization expenses  representing mostly employee severance and related costs  were million for the year ended december   and included a million charge recorded in june to support a plan to de layer our management structure and reduce costs in lower performing business units 
the plan called for the elimination of approximately positions  primarily in europe and north america 
other income expense  net was a net income of million and a net expense of million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this million favorable variation is due primarily to expenses related to our initial public offering in november at that time  the company terminated the monitoring services provided to the company by affiliates of the sponsors  incurring a one time fee of million 
monitoring fees for such services were million for the year ended december  in addition  the company incurred a million loss resulting from the early repayment of senior discount notes with an accreted value of million  using proceeds from the initial public offering of common stock 
also contributing to the year over year decrease in net other expense was a favorable change in foreign currency transaction gains and losses of million 
an increase in losses from asset write offs and disposals of million and a million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries partly offset these favorable variations 
net interest expense  defined as the combination of interest income and interest expense  of million for the year ended december  increased by million from the million reported for the year ended december  the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings in more than offset the impact of a lower average debt level compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate for the year ended december  of  after excluding the impact of the aforementioned charge for ipr d 
the effective tax rate for included onetime tax costs related to restructuring  in order to more efficiently manage global cash and allow for more tax efficient repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
the effective tax rate in is lower primarily because the tax cost related to the prior year restructuring does not repeat in in addition  the taxable repatriation of foreign earnings was reduced  in part  because of the restructuring

the company has completed a comparison of the benefits available to it under the jobs creation act to those under other strategies for global cash and debt management  and it has compared the benefits of implementing the incentive to the costs required to implement it 
based upon this analysis  the company has decided not to structure its earnings repatriation under the provisions of the jobs creation act 
minority interest expense was million lower than the million for the year ended december  higher earnings were reported by the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries in india and japan  however  these were more than offset by lower earnings of our non wholly owned subsidiaries in saudi arabia  malaysia  and spain

minority interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change resulted mostly from higher earnings reported by all of majority owned subsidiaries and the addition of our new joint venture with katayama chemical inc in june these increases were partly offset by the impact of the sale of the predecessor s south african subsidiary in liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
historically  the company s main source of liquidity has been its solid cash flow generated by operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  a decrease of million from the million provided by operating activities in higher working capital requirements  primarily for trade accounts receivable  accrued compensation and other accrued expenses  more than offset the increase in cash generated by earnings in from for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million comprised of million for the period from november  through december  and million for the predecessor during the period from january  through november  the predecessor had million of net cash outflows for its accounts receivable securitization program  which was terminated in october investing activities

net proceeds from divestitures totaled million during the year ended december   which was mostly attributable to the sale of the predecessor s south african subsidiary 
net cash received by the predecessor from notes receivable from related parties was million during financing activities 
most of the million of cash used for financing activities during the year ended december  was attributable to prepayments of the company s term loan a debt totaling million and a million reduction in borrowings from the company s receivables facility

in december  ondeo nalco group entered into a million off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization facility that allowed it to periodically transfer undivided interests in most of its us trade receivables 
this facility was terminated in october in anticipation of the sale of ondeo nalco group by suez 
since the transactions  we have been highly leveraged 
our liquidity requirements are significant  primarily due to debt service requirements as well as research and development and capital investment 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow generated from operations  but we also have availability under a million revolving credit facility and a million receivables facility  in each case subject to certain conditions 
we believe that our financial position and financing structure will provide flexibility in worldwide financing activities and permit us to respond to changing conditions in credit markets 
senior credit facilities 
our revolving credit facility is part of our senior credit facilities that were entered into on november  our senior credit facilities also include a million term loan a facility which includes an million tranche maturing on november  and a  million term loan b facility maturing on november  borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a floating base rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan a facility is with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor or eurocurrency borrowings and may be reduced subject to our attaining certain leverage ratios 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan b facility is with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor or eurocurrency borrowings 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan b facility is not subject to adjustment

the term loan b facility will amortize each year in an amount equal to per annum in equal quarterly installments for the first six years and nine months  with the remaining amount payable on november  in addition to the million of scheduled payments due for the year ended december   we repaid an additional million using cash generated from operations and proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization facility 
principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and payable in full at maturity on november  as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the senior credit facilities contain a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and our subsidiaries ability  including nalco company  to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  repay other indebtedness  pay dividends and distributions or repurchase certain capital stock  create liens on assets  make investments  loans or advances  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  amend certain material agreements governing our indebtedness  change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries including nalco company and enter into hedging agreements 
in addition  the senior credit facilities require nalco company to maintain the following financial covenants a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum capital expenditures limitation 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  senior discount notes  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
as part of the transactions  in november  nalco company issued million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior subordinated notes due on january   our subsidiaries  nalco finance holdings llc and nalco finance holdings inc  issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due prior to february   interest will accrue on the notes in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such notes 
the accreted value of each note will increase from the date of issuance until february  at a rate of per annum  reflecting the accrual of non cash interest  such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount at maturity on february  cash interest payments on the notes will be due and payable beginning in our primary source of liquidity for such payments will be cash flow generated from the operations of subsidiaries  including nalco holdings and nalco company 
however  the terms of nalco company s senior credit agreement fully prohibit nalco holdings and our other subsidiaries from paying dividends or otherwise transferring assets to the issuers 
in addition  the terms of certain of the indentures governing the existing senior notes and senior subordinated notes of nalco company significantly restrict nalco company and our other subsidiaries from paying dividends  making distributions and otherwise transferring assets to the issuers of the senior discount notes 
in addition  as a condition to making such payments to the issuers based on such formula  nalco holdings must have an adjusted ebitda to interest expense ratio of at least to after giving effect to any such payments 
notwithstanding such restrictions  such indentures permit an aggregate of million of such payments to be made whether or not there is availability under the formula or the conditions to its use are met 
in december  nalco finance holdings llc and nalco finance holdings inc redeemed a portion of the senior discount notes with an accreted value of million using proceeds from the initial public offering of common stock of nalco holding company 
the issuers paid a million premium to redeem the notes 
after the partial redemption  the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the notes declined to million from million 
the indentures governing the senior discount notes  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to

sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
subject to certain exceptions  the indentures governing the senior discount notes  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes permit the company and our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness 
covenant compliance 
the breach of covenants in our senior credit agreement that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda could result in a default under that agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indentures 
additionally  under our debt agreements  our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is used to determine our compliance with many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes and in our senior credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures and our senior credit facility 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants 
adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows

we are required to make adjustments to ebitda for monitoring fees paid to the sponsors  franchise taxes  k matching contributions and other pro forma adjustments 
these pro forma adjustments include purchase accounting adjustments for pensions and the incremental rent expense we will incur under our sublease with suez 

spacer

spacer

our financing agreements also permit us to adjust ebitda on a pro forma basis for certain cost savings that we expect to achieve 
we initiated a comprehensive cost reduction plan that was expected to yield annual savings of at least million on a proforma basis in we implemented this plan immediately upon consummation of the acquisition 
the remainder of our cost reduction plan is expected to realize incremental efficiencies through work process redesign and other targeted cost improvement programs  which address inefficiencies in our administrative and overhead functions  as well as other support functions around the world

our senior credit facility requires us to maintain an adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio starting at a minimum of x and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio starting at a maximum of x  in each case for the most recent four quarter period 
failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default under the senior credit agreement 
if our lenders failed to waive any such default  our repayment obligations under the senior credit agreement could be accelerated  which would also constitute a default under our indentures

our ability to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our indentures  subject to specified exceptions  is tied to an adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio of at least to  except that we may incur certain debt and make certain restricted payments and certain permitted investments without regard to the ratio  such as up to an aggregate principal amount of  million including  million that was outstanding under our term loan facilities as of

local lines of credit 
certain of our non us subsidiaries have lines of credit to support local requirements 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these local lines of credit was approximately million 
certain of these lines of credit are equally and ratably secured with obligations under our senior credit facilities 
receivables facility 
nalco company entered into a receivables facility on june  that provides up to million in funding from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by jpmorgan chase bank  one of the lenders under nalco company s senior credit facilities  based on availability of eligible receivables and satisfaction of other customary conditions 
at the closing  we received million in proceeds  which we used to repay term loans under the senior credit facilities 
in connection with the receivables facility we established a wholly owned consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary  nalco receivables llc the transferor  to which nalco company and one of its domestic subsidiaries the sellers sell trade accounts receivable the receivables pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement 
pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement  the transferor then transfers an undivided interest in the purchased receivables to the commercial paper conduit or the related bank sponsor the transferees in exchange for cash 
the transferor s purchase of receivables from the sellers is financed through the simultaneous transfer of this undivided interest in the purchased receivables  together with cash contributed to it by nalco company and the advances made by the sellers under an intercompany note 
nalco company  as the receivables collection agent  services  administers and collects the receivables under the receivables transfer agreement for which it receives a monthly servicing fee at a rate of per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of receivables 
borrowings under the receivables facility bear interest at a floating base rate plus a usage fee 
the usage fee varies based upon our leverage ratio as calculated under the senior credit facilities and is currently of the amount funded 
in addition  the transferor is required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the receivables facility that varies based upon the same ratio and is currently of the unused portion of the commitments 
these rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date 
availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance from time to time 
aggregate availability is determined by using a formula that reduces the gross receivables balance by factors that take into account historical default and dilution rates  excessive concentrations and average days outstanding and the costs of the facility 
based on the terms of this facility and on the criteria described above  as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable balance was considered eligible for financing under the program  of which approximately million would have been available for funding 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility 
this facility is treated as a general financing agreement resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility being recorded as interest expense 
results of operations for the preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers periods for the fiscal year ended december for ease of comparison purposes  financial data for the period from november  through december  has been added to the financial data for the period from january  through november   to arrive at a twelve month combined period ended december  this combined data may be referred to as the year ended december  or

amounts beyond are not reasonably estimable 
our contractual obligations and commitments over the next several years are significant 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow generated from operations 
in the period january  through december  our cumulative cash flow from operations was million 
we have availability under a million revolving credit facility to assist us  if required  in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 
this multi year revolving credit facility matures in november if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  excluding million of outstanding letters of credit 
we believe that cash flow generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be adequate to meet our obligations and business requirements 
our ability to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors  and the cost of litigation claims  among other things 
the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires our performance pursuant to a funding commitment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments as necessary to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we manage foreign currency exchange risk arising from financial activities pursuant to our corporate guidelines 
forward contracts and  occasionally  swaps and options are utilized to protect these cash flows from adverse movements in exchange rates  and we account for these instruments by marking them to market at each balance sheet date 
we may also employ hedge accounting as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition  we use certain foreign currency debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
upon issuance  we designated the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  and the million term loan as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose assets  liabilities  and operations are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the euro denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment 
accordingly  changes in the value of the euro denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  to offset changes in the value of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose financial statements are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
we formally assess  on a quarterly basis  whether the euro denominated debt is effective at offsetting changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash pretax gain in the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment account related to this hedge 
no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in income 
we also manage operational transactional foreign currency risk  particularly in emerging markets  by closely managing both pricing and raw material sourcing 
risks associated with foreign exchange translation exposures are not hedged 
we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our derivative foreign currency instruments outstanding at december  and  a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which those derivative foreign currency instruments are denominated would result in a gain or loss in fair values of less than million and million  respectively 
at december   we had  million of variable rate debt 
a increase in the average interest rate would increase future interest expense by approximately million per year 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of the changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not reflect the effect of such changes on the related hedged transactions or on other operating transactions 
the analysis also does not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to satisfy fully their obligations under the contracts 
we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for speculative or trading purposes
