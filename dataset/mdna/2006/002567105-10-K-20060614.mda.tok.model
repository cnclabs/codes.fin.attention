item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview abaxis  inc us or we  incorporated in california in  develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any veterinary or human patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a system consisting of a compact kilogram pounds portable blood analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests on veterinary patients and tests on human patients 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
we generally operate with limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our vetscan dxs and piccolo products and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies our financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the veterinary and medical markets 
revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed and determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we also provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
revenue from such sales is allocated separately to the instruments and free goods based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue allocated to free goods is deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer  which is then recorded as an increase in revenues 
the revenue associated with free goods related to extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
at march   and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances were   and  respectively  and the long term portion of deferred revenue balances were   and  respectively 
the fluctuation is due to the types of customer incentives programs offered during the period and also on when the free goods are shipped to the customer and the maintenance period of the maintenance agreements 
we offer trade in programs from time to time in which we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods to customers for purchasing our instruments or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded according to the policies described above 
distributor and customer rebates 
we offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentive offerings from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during the qualifying period 
the distributor pricing rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during the qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to customers who purchase specific instruments during the promotional period 
the cash rebate is recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program started in fiscal and continued in fiscal the program is offered to distributors  primarily in the united states veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of reagent discs during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross revenues when the company records the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to six months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to distributor pricing rebates were   and  respectively 
the change in the rebate accrual at march   as compared to march   was due to the distributors not meeting the purchase requirements in the fourth quarter of fiscal rebate programs offered to customers vary from period to period 
generally  the customer rebate program relates to the sale of certain products or instruments during a specified promotional period 
there were no customer rebate programs offered in fiscal during fiscal  the customer rebate program was in effect during the quarters ended june  and december  as part of the rebate program  the customer receives a cash rebate upon purchasing certain veterinary instruments in the united states market during the promotional period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of instruments sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of a rebate 
the company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of gross revenues when the company records the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to six months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to customer rebates were  and  respectively 
the increase in the rebate accrual at march   as compared to march   was due to the type of marketing promotions offered during fiscal and the timing of the rebate obligations to the customers 
prior to fiscal  the customer rebate program was not significant in the determination of operating income 
the following table is an analysis of the roll forward activities for the distributor and customer rebate accruals balance at beginning of year provisions payments balance at end of year year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates sales and other allowances 
we maintain sales allowances for defective reagent discs  which include the credit that we issue to customers for defective reagent discs 
the balances related to sales allowance for defective reagent discs at march   and were   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the accrual of the sales allowance for defective reagent discs from year to year is based on the failure rate of reagent discs  the increase in the sale of our reagent discs and the timing of the credit issued to customers 
we also establish  upon shipment of our products to distributors  a provision for potentially defective reagent discs  based on historical experience 
the company provides a provision for the potentially defective reagent discs shipped to distributors during the current period using internal data available to estimate both the level of inventory in the distribution channel  the lag time for customers to report defective reagent discs and the historical experience of defective reagent discs 
the accrual balances for potentially defective reagent discs at march   and were   and  respectively 
changes in our estimates for accruals related to credits for defective reagent discs have not been material to operating income 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased revenues  should we experience an increase of defective products 
in the future  the actual defective reagent discs may exceed our estimates  which could adversely affect our operating income 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 
warranty reserves 
we provide provisions at the time the related revenue is recognized for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligations of one to two years on our instruments 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure 
we analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance each quarter 
we maintain a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of the expected costs to repair or replace the instruments under warranty 
if actual repair costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of product sales may be required 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
valuation of long lived assets 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts to be recovered 
as of march   we had net deferred tax assets of  primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards nols  which consist of  of federal nols that expire at various dates from fiscal years through at march   the company maintained a valuation allowance of  relating to federal research and development tax credits which expire in fiscal years through in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecasts of future taxable income and utilization of research and development tax credits 
statutory limitations and short expiration periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance 
we will continue to evaluate our deferred tax assets in the future to determine whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required at some future point
