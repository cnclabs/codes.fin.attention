subsequently  uil holdings invested the proceeds of the sale of ui s generation facilities in non utility businesses to offset the expected reduction in utility earnings resulting from this restructuring 
some of these investments have not generated expected results due to a number of factors  including the following a change in market conditions resulting in lower profitability for construction business  as well as challenges in realizing operational synergies  for xcelecom  poor investment market conditions offsetting the value of uci s passive investments  and high natural gas prices affecting the value of ube
