item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition  development and exploration activities in the us gulf coast region 
we are the largest oil and natural gas producer in mississippi  own the largest reserves of carbon dioxide co used for tertiary oil recovery east of the mississippi river  and hold significant operating acreage onshore louisiana  alabama  and in the barnett shale play near fort worth  texas 
our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation  drilling  and proven engineering extraction processes  including secondary and tertiary recovery operations 
our corporate headquarters are in plano  texas a suburb of dallas  and we have three primary field offices located in houma  louisiana  laurel  mississippi  and cleburne  texas 
overview continued expansion of our tertiary operations 
since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in mississippi over six years ago  we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations 
we particularly like this play because of its risk profile  rate of return and lack of competition in our operating area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own  and these large volumes of co that we own drive the play 
please refer to the section entitled co operations below for a discussion of these operations  their potential  and the ramifications of our continuing emphasis on these operations 
having enough co 

is one of the most important ingredients  if not the key ingredient  to our tertiary operations 
during we increased our proved co reserve quantities by  from tcf as of december   to approximately tcf as of december  both of these quantities are on a working interest basis see co operations co

operating results 
earnings and cash flow were at record annual levels in  primarily as a result of high commodity prices 
production increased approximately over the prior year s production after adjusting for the production associated with our offshore properties sold in july  even though we deferred approximately  boe d during as a result of two hurricanes see operating income production below 
virtually all expenses increased during  on both an absolute and per boe basis  as we experienced cost increases in almost every aspect of our business  as much as to per annum for certain items 
operating expenses also increased as a result of our increased emphasis on tertiary operations  which have higher operating costs per boe than our other properties 
nevertheless  during the high commodity prices more than offset the higher expenses 
as has been our practice for several years  we are reinvesting virtually all of our cash flow in new projects  with a desire to i further increase our production and reserves  and ii keep our balance sheet strong by limiting our exploration and development budget to an amount approximately equal to our cash flow from operations 
during  our proved reserves increased from mmboe as of december   to mmboe as of december   replacing approximately of our production  over of which was from internal organic growth and the balance from acquisitions 
net income for was million  approximately double net income of million and nearly a three fold increase over net income of million 
lower expense on our commodity hedges improved our net income 
we paid out approximately million during as compared to million during and million during in settlement payments on our commodity hedges see market risk management 
as our financial position has improved over the last few years  we have generally hedged less  thus reducing our out of pocket cash payments  even though commodity prices have continued to increase 
stock split 
on october   our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from million shares to million shares and to split our common stock on a two for one basis 
stockholders of record as of the close of business on october   received one additional share of denbury common stock for each share of common stock held at that time 
all per share numbers for all periods included herein have been restated for this two for one split 
sale of offshore operations 
on july   we closed the sale of denbury offshore  inc  a subsidiary that held our offshore assets  for approximately million after sale adjustments 
our offshore properties made up approximately of our year end proved reserves approximately bcfe as of december  and represented approximately  boe d of our second quarter production 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent acquisitions on january   we completed an acquisition of three producing oil properties that are future potential co tertiary oil flood candidates tinsley field approximately miles northwest of jackson  mississippi  citronelle field in southwest alabama  and the smaller south cypress creek field near the company s eucutta field in eastern mississippi 
we expect to begin our initial tertiary development work at tinsley field during with more extensive development planned for the timing of tertiary development at citronelle field is uncertain as we will need to build a to mile pipeline extension of our co 

line to east mississippi before flooding can commence  and south cypress creek will probably be flooded following our initial development of our other east mississippi properties 
see co operations for further information regarding our co operations 
the preliminary adjusted purchase price for these three properties was approximately million  after adjusting for interim net cash flow and minor purchase price adjustments 
the acquisition was funded with proceeds of the million of senior subordinated notes issued in december and bank financing under the company s existing credit facility  bringing the outstanding balance of the company s bank debt as of january   to approximately million 
these three fields are currently producing approximately  boe d net to the acquired interests  and have proved reserves of approximately million boes 
we operate all three fields and own the majority of the working interest 
during  we reached an agreement with southern natural gas company to acquire a mile natural gas pipeline that runs from gwinville field in central mississippi to near lake st 
john field  near the louisiana mississippi border 
this pipeline crosses our existing co pipeline in southwest mississippi and will allow us to transport co to two oil fields we acquired during  lake st 
john and cranfield fields 
the purchase price and associated anticipated remediation work is estimated at approximately million 
closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval  which may take up to six months 
prior to converting the pipeline to co service  a smaller mile natural gas pipeline will need to be constructed to replace natural gas service to the local communities currently being serviced by the pipeline 
capital resources and liquidity our current capital budget for  excluding any potential acquisitions  is approximately million  which at commodity futures prices as of mid february appears to be slightly more than our anticipated cash flow from operations 
as has been our practice in the past  we attempt to reinvest all of our available cash flow from operations to find additional reserves and increase production 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow 
therefore  during the last few years as commodity prices have increased  we have increased our capital budget throughout the year 
as a result of the recent cost inflation in our industry  many of our recent budget increases have related to escalating costs rather than additional projects 
in this inflationary environment  we often have to either increase our capital budget or consider the elimination of a portion of our planned projects 
we anticipate that we would fund any minor differences between our capital budget and cash flow from operations with bank debt  but if the difference becomes significant  we would likely postpone some of our projects 
as of february   we had approximately million of unused borrowing base on our bank credit line  which in our opinion could be significantly expanded if desired 
we plan to spend approximately of our capital budget on tertiary related projects and approximately in the barnett shale area  with the balance split almost equally between our other operating areas 
although we now control most of the fields along our existing co pipeline in southwest mississippi  there are several fields in east mississippi that could be acquired to further expand our planned tertiary operations there  plus we are continuing to seek additional interests in the fields that we currently own 
further  we would like to add additional phases or areas of tertiary operations by acquiring other old oil fields in other parts of our region of operations  building a co pipeline to those areas and initiating additional tertiary floods 
the purchase price of these potential tertiary fields can vary widely  depending on the level of existing production and conventional oil reserves  making it impractical to forecast our acquisition expenditures 
we would likely fund any acquisitions with debt  supplemented as we feel necessary with equity 
although we are comfortable with our existing debt levels  they are higher than they have been the last couple of years because we funded the recently closed million property acquisition see recent acquisitions with debt 
since it is our desire to maintain a strong financial position  it is unlikely that we will 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations increase our debt levels by any significant amount in the near future other than on a temporary basis  and we have not eliminated the possibility of issuing equity to reduce part  or all  of the bank debt incurred for the recent acquisition 
we could also generate cash  if desired  by refinancing our essentially completed million co pipeline to east mississippi  recouping our expended capital and instead paying for the cost of the pipeline over time 
with our current credit availability and other options that we believe are available to us  we do not anticipate having any liquidity issues in the foreseeable future 
at december   we had outstanding million principal amount of subordinated notes due  million principal amount of subordinated notes due  approximately million of capital lease commitments  no bank debt  and working capital of million 
we borrowed million on our bank line at the end of january and used available cash to fund the million acquisition  which closed on january  sources and uses of capital resources during  we spent million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures  million on co exploration and development expenditures including approximately million for our copipeline to east mississippi  and approximately million on property acquisitions  for total capital expenditures of approximately million 
our exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million of geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million spent on facilities and recompletion costs 
our acquisition expenditures include the purchase of additional interest and acreage in the barnett shale area and purchase of two oil fields  cranfield and lake st 
john fields  which may be potential tertiary flood candidates in the future 
our million of capital expenditures included an increase of million in our accrued capital expenditures  with the remaining cash portion of our capital expenditures funded primarily with million of cash flow from operations and approximately million of short term investments remaining at december   from the sale of our offshore properties during additionally  we issued million of subordinated debt in december and raised million during from the sale of another volumetric production payment of co to genesis energy  co genesis  along with a related long term co supply agreement with an industrial customer 
all of these sources not only funded our capital expenditures  but also increased our cash balance at year end to million  with a portion of such funds used in january to partially fund the million acquisition

our exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million of geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million spent on facilities and recompletion costs 
we funded these expenditures with million of cash flow from operations  with the balance funded with net proceeds from the sale of our offshore properties 
we paid back all of our bank debt during the third quarter of with the offshore sale proceeds  leaving us with approximately million of cash and million of short term investments as of december  we also raised million during the third quarter of from the sale of another volumetric production payment of co to genesis  along with a related long term co supply agreement with an industrial customer 
adjusted cash flow from operations a non gaap measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under results of operations operating results was million for  while cash flow from operations  the gaap measure  was million 
during  we generated approximately million of cash flow from operations and generated an additional million of cash from sales of oil and gas properties 
the largest single asset sale was the sale of laurel field  acquired from coho in august  which netted us approximately million 
later in the year  we also sold a volumetric production payment to genesis  which netted us approximately million of cash 
during  we spent million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures  million on co capital investments and acquisitions  and approximately million on oil and natural gas property acquisitions  for total capital expenditures of approximately million

as is common in our industry  we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program 
these commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget  which for is currently set at million 
in addition  we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting  engineering and legal fees  software maintenance  subscriptions  and other overhead type items 
normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses

long term contracts require us to deliver co to our industrial co customers at various contracted prices  plus we have a co delivery obligation to genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments vpp entered into during  and based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric production payments  we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to bcf of co to these customers over the next years  however  since the group as a whole has historically taken less co than the maximum allowed in their contracts  based on the current level of deliveries  we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately bcf 
the maximum volume required in any given year is approximately mmcf d  although based on our current level of deliveries  this would likely be reduced to approximately mmcf d 
given the size of our proven co reserves at december  approximately tcf before deducting approximately bcf for the three vpps  our current production capabilities and our projected levels of co usage for our own tertiary flooding program  we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations 
results of operations co operations overview 
our interest in tertiary operations has increased to the point that approximately of our expenditures and capital budget are dedicated to tertiary related operations 
we particularly like this play as i it is lower risk and more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities  ii it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices generally in the twenties  depending on the specific field and area  and iii we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own  and these large volumes of co 

that we own drive the play 
we talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases 
phase i is in southwest mississippi and includes several fields along our mile co 

pipeline that we acquired in the most significant fields in this area are little creek  mallalieu  mccomb and brookhaven 
phase ii  which we are just starting with the completion of our co 

pipeline to east mississippi  includes eucutta  soso  martinville and heidelberg fields 
with the properties acquired in our recent acquisition that closed in january see recent acquisitions above  we have labeled the planned operations at tinsley field  northwest of jackson dome  as 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations phase iii 
phase iv includes cranfield and lake st 
john fields  two fields near the mississippi louisiana border west of the fields in phase i 
co 

resources 
in february  we acquired the sources of co located near jackson  mississippi  and a mile pipeline to transport it to our oil fields 
since february  we have acquired two and drilled nine additional co 

producing wells  significantly increasing our estimated proved co reserves from approximately bcf at the time of acquisition to approximately tcf as of december   approximately bcf more than we estimate we need for our existing and currently planned phases of tertiary operations 
the estimate of tcf of proved co reserves is based on ownership of the co reserves  of which denbury s net revenue interest ownership is approximately tcf  and is included in the evaluation of proven co reserves prepared by degolyer macnaughton 
in discussing the available co reserves  we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves  as this is the amount that is available both for denbury s tertiary recovery programs and industrial users  as denbury is responsible for distributing the entire co production stream for both of these uses 
we currently estimate that it will take approximately bcf of co to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at december  today  we own every known producing co well in the region  providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in mississippi and louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery 
as of january  we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately mmcf d of co  over five times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in we continue to drill additional co wells  with three more wells planned for  in order to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven co reserves 
our drilling activity at jackson dome will continue beyond as our current forecasts for the four planned phases suggest that we will need over mmcf d of co production by in addition to using co for our tertiary operations  we sell co to third party industrial users under long term contracts 
most of these industrial contracts have been sold to genesis along with a volumetric production payment for the co our average daily co production during  and was approximately million  million  and million cubic feet per day  of which approximately in  and in  and in was used in our tertiary recovery operations  with the balance delivered to genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users 
we spent approximately per mcf in operating expenses to produce our co 

during  more than our annual average of per mcf  primarily due to increased labor  utilities and equipment rental expenses during  coupled with higher royalty expenses because several of our royalties correlate with oil prices 
during  we spent approximately per mcf to produce our co 
our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of co during was approximately  after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the co production  as compared to approximately during overview of tertiary economics 
most of our tertiary operations are economic at oil prices in the twenties  although the economics vary by field 
our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry and this trend is expected to continue 
our inception to date finding and development costs including future development and abandonment costs for our tertiary oil fields through december   was approximately per boe 
currently  we forecast that these costs will range from to per boe over the life of each field  depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations  the amount of potential oil  the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities  etc 
our operating costs for tertiary operations averaged per boe in and are expected to range from to per boe over the life of each field  again depending on the field itself 
oil quality is another significant factor that impacts the economics 
in phase i southwest mississippi  the light sweet oil produced from our tertiary operations receives near nymex prices  while the average discount to nymex for the lower quality oil produced from the fields in phase ii east mississippi  some of which we plan to start flooding during  was per boe during  a differential that is significantly higher than historical averages and one that appears to increase as oil prices increase 
while these economic factors have wide ranges  our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our traditional oil and gas operations  and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area 
while it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production  we do believe that our 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return  with relatively low risk  and thus will be the backbone of our company s growth for the foreseeable future 
although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable  there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay our overall tertiary development program 
we believe that such delays  if any  should only be temporary 
financial statement impact of co operations 
the increasing emphasis on co tertiary recovery projects has made  and will continue to make  an impact on our financial results and certain operating statistics 
first  there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures and the resulting production increases  as these tertiary operations require the building of facilities before co flooding can commence and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds ie  oil production commences to the injection of ie 
further  as we expand to other areas  there will be times when we spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves as these other areas  for the most part  will require an oil production response to the co injections before any oil reserves can be recorded 
further  even after a field has proven reserves  there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field 
secondly  these tertiary projects are usually more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the co primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the co back into a liquid state for re injection purposes 
as commodity and energy prices increase  so do our operating expenses in these fields 
our operating cost for our tertiary operations during averaged per boe  as compared to an estimated cost of around to per boe for a more traditional oil property 
we allocate the cost to produce and transport the co between co used in our own oil fields and co sold to commercial users including obligations covered by the volumetric production payments sold to genesis 
most of our co operating expenses are allocated to our oil fields and are recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields 
since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our co  the operating costs per barrel will generally be higher at the inception of co injection before oil production is realized in a particular field 
our overall operating expenses on a per boe basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations 
generally  these higher operating costs are somewhat offset by lower finding and development costs which helps to lower our overall depreciation and depletion rate see also overview of tertiary economics above 
third  our net oil price relative to nymex prices may be affected by the oil produced from our tertiary operations see overview of tertiary operations above 
currently  all of our current co related oil production is from fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to  and sometimes actually higher than  nymex prices 
however  the oil produced from fields we plan to flood as part of phase ii have recently sold at a significant discount to nymex 
the relative mix of this production  coupled with changing market conditions for the various types of crude  can cause our nymex differentials to fluctuate widely 
analysis of co tertiary recovery operating activities 
we currently have tertiary operations ongoing at little creek  mallalieu  mccomb  smithdale and brookhaven fields  as well as various smaller adjacent fields 
we project that our oil production from these operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases 
as of december   we had approximately mmbbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations mmbbls of which was in phase i and the balance in phase ii and have identified and estimated significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region 
we plan to start co 

injections at three fields in phase ii within the first half of  although we do not expect any material production response until during  we will also start preliminary development work at tinsley field phase iii and at cranfield phase iv 
our oil production from our co 

tertiary recovery activities has steadily increased during the last few years  from  bbls d in to  bbls d during our oil production in the third quarter of decreased over second quarter levels primarily as a result of production deferred because of two hurricanes which disrupted our electrical power  forcing us to temporarily shut in our production 
tertiary oil production represented approximately of our total corporate oil production during the fourth quarter of and approximately of our total corporate production during the same period on a boe basis 
we expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase  although the increases are not always predictable or consistent 
following is a chart with our tertiary oil production by field for  and by quarter for 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average daily production boe d first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter tertiary oil field brookhaven little creek lazy creek mallalieu east and west mccomb olive smithdale total tertiary oil production our operations in this area  as well as others  have had minor delays during these delays are caused by various factors difficulties reentering certain injection wells  which has required that some wells be redrilled  delays in getting certain permits and right of ways  delays caused by the two hurricanes  and a general tightening of available materials and equipment in the industry 
generally  the fields are performing as anticipated  but tertiary oil production was not quite as high as originally expected because of these delays and the two hurricanes 
in addition  the timing of specific well responses is not always possible to accurately forecast  so we could experience variances from our expected long term oil production forecast 
in addition to higher energy costs to operate our tertiary recycling facilities related to higher commodity prices  we have experienced general cost inflation during the last few years 
we have also leased a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations  which further increases operating expenses 
over the last three years we have leased certain equipment that qualify for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately million as of december   and we expect to enter into new leases for equipment during representing additional underlying costs of approximately million 
further  the cost to produce our co 

increased during see co 

resources above  all of which resulted in an increase in our tertiary operating cost per boe from per boe in to per boe during the absolute amount of operating expenses related to tertiary operations increased from million during to million during and million during through december   we had spent a total of million on fields currently being flooded included allocated acquisition costs  and had received million in net cash flow revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures  or net positive cash flow of million 
the proved oil reserves in our co 

fields have a pv value of billion  using december   constant nymex pricing of per bbl 
these amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our co producing properties  but do include co 

source field lease operating costs and transportation costs 
through december   we had a balance of approximately million of unrecovered costs for the co 

assets 
co related capital budget for tentatively  we plan to spend approximately million in in the jackson dome area with the intent to add additional co reserves and deliverability for future operations 
approximately million in capital expenditures is budgeted in for our phase i properties southwest mississippi and approximately million for phase ii properties east mississippi  plus an additional million for properties in phases iii and iv  making our combined co related expenditures just under of our capital budget 
operating income adjusted cash flow from operations see discussion below regarding this non gaap measure and net income have increased each year during the last three years  along with rising commodity prices 
production declined from to and approximately from to  primarily related to the sale of our offshore properties in july and further impacted by the hurricanes during  but the effect of the deferred production was more than offset by the higher commodity prices

cash flow from operations is the gaap measure as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in our discussion herein  we have elected to discuss these two components of cash flow provided by operations 
adjusted cash flow from operations  the non gaap measure  measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables 
we believe that it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations separately  as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in our business caused by changes in production  prices  operating costs  and related operational factors  without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that year 
we also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business  but merely a timing issue from one period to the next  with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity 
the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business  however  we prefer to discuss its effect separately 
for instance  as noted above  during  our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased as a result of our higher drilling activity level late in the year  particularly offshore  increasing our available cash from operations 
during  we had a million difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our gaap cash flow from operations 
the most significant factor was the transfer of approximately million of accrued production receivables relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser 
this reduction in accrued production receivables during was not considered a collection of receivables for our gaap cash flow from operations 
in addition to the effect of transferred receivables  our other accrued production receivables increased during the year due to the increase in commodity prices  and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued liabilities by approximately million as a result of less overall activity as of year end  both of which contributed to the significant difference between our adjusted cash flow and gaap cash flow from operations 
during  we had a million increase to our gaap cash flow from operations resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations 
this is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with increased capital spending levels as compared to the prior year 
our accrual for production receivables was higher at the end of than a year earlier  due to higher oil and natural gas prices  partially offsetting the benefit of higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities

adjusting for the offshore sale  overall production increased approximately on a boe d basis during and approximately during  anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and barnett shale play  generally offset by overall declines in our onshore conventional properties in mississippi and natural gas wells in louisiana 
however  other factors that caused fluctuations between the various periods should also be noted as outlined below 
during august and september   hurricanes katrina and rita came ashore  negatively affecting almost all of our existing production 
while we did not incur any significant property damage as a result of either storm  we estimate that we deferred approximately  barrels of oil equivalent boe of production during the third quarter of as most of our fields were shut in for periods ranging from several days to a few weeks  primarily because of a lack of power or because of flooding 
as a result  production was lower in the third quarter than in the immediately prior quarter in every area of our operations except for the barnett shale play in texas 
while almost all of our wells had been returned to production by late october  we estimate that we deferred an additional boe d of production in the fourth quarter as a result of the two hurricanes 
in the aggregate  the deferred production from the two hurricanes lowered our average annual production rate by almost  boe d 
most of the non co fields in mississippi have been on a slight decline during the last few years as a result of normal depletion 
heidelberg field  our single largest field  which is located in this area  has partially offset this decline  as its production increased from to  then declined slightly in heidelberg production averaged  boe d during   boe d during  and  boe d during most production increases at heidelberg are attributable to additional natural gas drilling in the selma chalk formation as heidelberg s oil production has been slowly decreasing 
natural gas production at this field averaged mmcf d in  mmcf d in  and mmcf d in  making heidelberg field our single largest natural gas producing field during as more fully discussed in co operations above  oil production from our tertiary operations has increased each year 
while our onshore louisiana annual production average is less in than in  as a result of drilling 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations successful wells during including wells completed in january  production increased in louisiana during the fourth quarter of as compared to the prior quarters 
as a result  we expect our average production in louisiana to be higher than in production in this area  predominately natural gas  is relatively short lived in nature and can decline rapidly unless offset by new wells 
as an example  thornwell field  an onshore louisiana field  has been particularly volatile  averaging  boe d during   boe d during  reaching a three year low of boe d during the second quarter of  but then increasing to  boe d during the fourth quarter of as a result of our drilling two successful wells during in spite of its short life and volatile production  we have generated a good return on investment at thornwell  generating million of net positive cash flow operating revenues less operating expenses and capital expenditures through december   with a remaining pv value of million as of december  based on sec proved reserve report at year end prices 
natural gas production in the barnett shale has increased as a result of increased drilling activity in and and the acquisition of additional interests during the second quarter of that added approximately mmcf d of production 
these wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production as much as to  followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate  giving them an overall long production life 
natural gas production in this area is expected to further increase throughout as we anticipate drilling to wells in this area during we currently have four rigs running in this area 
our production for was weighted toward oil and we expect a similar weighting toward oil in due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations  unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas 
oil and natural gas revenues 
our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years  primarily as a result of higher commodity prices  offset in part by lower production as a result of the sale of offshore properties 
between and  revenues increased by 
the overall increase in commodity prices contributed million in additional revenues  a increase  partially offset by an overall decrease of million a decrease related to the lower production volumes 
between and  revenues increased by 
the overall increase in commodity prices contributed million in additional revenues  a increase  partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues of million a decrease related to the lower production volumes 
during  we made payments on our derivative contracts of million  down from million paid out during the prior year 
our payments related to a natural gas collar  lowering our effective net natural gas price by per mcf 
during  we paid out million on our oil hedges per bbl and million per mcf on our natural gas hedges relating to swaps and collars we purchased one to two years earlier when commodity prices were lower 
about million of the hedge payments related to swaps originally put in place to protect the rate of return for the coho acquisition in august the payments in were similar in nature  but slightly less due to lower overall commodity prices 
during  we paid out million on our oil hedges per bbl and million per mcf on our natural gas hedges on generally the same type of swaps and collars 
for  we have hedged a lower percentage of our overall production  so we do not anticipate that our payments on our derivative contracts will reach the levels seen during and see market risk management for a further discussion of our derivative activities 
our net oil and natural gas prices have increased each year as outlined in the above table 
these prices would have been even higher if our net price would have increased as much as nymex prices 
during and continuing into  the discount for our heavier  sour crude which predominantly applies to our eastern mississippi production increased significantly  lowering our overall net price relative to nymex 
our net oil price averaged below nymex during  increased to during  and further increased to during this occurred in spite of our increasing light sweet oil production from our phase i tertiary operations  which should have improved our overall net price as such crude receives near nymex prices and is becoming a higher percentage of our overall production 
however  as evident in and  the oil market is subject to significant and sudden changes and it is difficult to forecast these trends  although our experience indicates that the discount or nymex differential for our heavier sour crude increases as nymex oil prices increase 
during and  there was less fluctuation in our natural gas prices relative to nymex 
during both of those years  our net natural gas prices were at  or slightly above  the quoted nymex prices  primarily because of 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the high btu content of our natural gas and the close proximity of our louisiana natural gas production to henry hub 
for  we had an average premium to nymex and for  had a premium to nymex 
during  our natural gas price averaged below nymex  primarily due to the increasing natural production in the barnett shale area  which averaged per mcf below nymex 
the nymex differential in this area appears to increase with higher natural gas prices  plus  the production in this area is growing and is expected to increase again during although these factors could change depending on the overall natural gas market  we would expect these factors to gradually reduce our overall net natural gas price relative to nymex in the near future 
operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses increased on both a per boe basis and in total dollars primarily as a result of i our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations see discussion of those expenses under co operations above  ii general cost inflation in our industry  iii increased personnel and related costs  iv higher fuel and energy costs to operate our properties  v increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities  and vi higher workover costs 
during  operating costs averaged per boe  up from per boe in and per boe during operating expenses on our tertiary operations increased from million in to million during and million during  as a result of the increased tertiary activity level 
tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by the higher power and energy costs  higher costs for co and payments on leased facilities and equipment see co operations above 
we expect this increase in tertiary operating costs to continue and to further increase our cost per boe as they become a more significant portion of our total production and operations 
workover expenses increased by over million during as compared to  with over one half of the increase relating to costs to repair a mechanical failure on one onshore louisiana well 
workover expenses were also high in when we spent million on two individually significant workovers relating to mechanical failures of two onshore louisiana wells  plus several smaller workovers 
production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore were higher each year along with the increasing commodity prices 
the sale of our offshore properties also contributed to the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses on a per boe basis during and  as most of our offshore properties were tax exempt 
we also recognized incremental transportation expenses paid by us to genesis as a result of a change in the way we market our crude oil 
beginning in september  we commenced using genesis as a transporter rather than a purchaser 
this incremental transportation cost is approximately million per quarter  but is more than offset by higher oil revenue and this change in the way we do business has given us a higher gross margin 
general and administrative expenses during the last three years  general and administrative g a expenses on a per boe basis have increased from per boe during  to per boe during  to per boe during  increasing even faster than the gross aggregate dollar increases in g a expense as production has declined each year due primarily to the sale of our offshore properties

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations million during see below 
we also incurred approximately million to provide food  water  gasoline  and other essential supplies to our employees and charitable organizations in mississippi and louisiana following the hurricanes 
in addition  we incurred higher professional service and consultant fees primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance  investigation of hotline reports  and documentation and testing of our new software system that we began using in january  as well as increased maintenance costs as a result of the change to our new software system 
these increases were offset by the absence of approximately million of employee severance payments paid in related to the sale of our offshore properties in july gross g a expenses increased million  or  between and the largest component of the increase was approximately million of employee severance payments for the offshore professional and technical staff terminated in conjunction with our offshore property sale 
we also incurred additional g a expenses associated with our corporate restructuring in december  compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  the sale of stock by the texas pacific group in march  a provision for potential litigation losses  amortization of restricted stock grants  higher bonus levels for employees than in due to the strong performance during  and overall increases in most other categories of g a due to general cost inflation 
from august through january  we granted a total of million shares of restricted stock to our officers and independent directors  generating deferred compensation expense of approximately million  the market value of the shares on the date of grant 
approximately of this restricted stock vests over five years and the balance upon retirement in addition to vesting upon death  disability or a change of control 
we are amortizing the non cash million of compensation expense over the five year vesting period and over the projected retirement date vesting period  expensing approximately million during and million during higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from the incremental development activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross g a  partially reduced by the impact of the offshore property sale 
our well operating agreements allow us  when we are the operator  to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well 
as a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions  additional tertiary operations  and drilling activity during the past year  the amount we recovered as operator overhead charges increased by between and and between and capitalized exploration costs decreased in as a result of the personnel reductions in our offshore area related to the property sale and remained essentially flat in due to additional personnel and related cost increases 
the net effect of the increases in gross g a expenses  operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a increase in net g a expense between and and a increase between and the increase was even higher on a per boe basis as a result of lower production  primarily related to the offshore property sale

as a result of the lower production because of the offshore sale and production deferred as a result of the two hurricanes  interest expense on a per boe basis was not as positive as it was on an absolute basis

we adjust our dd a rate each quarter based on any changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs  and thus our dd a rate could change significantly in the future 
our dd a rate on a per boe basis increased between and  primarily due to rising costs and increases in capital spending 
during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  of which approximately million was included in our full cost pool  with the balance becoming part of our unevaluated properties 
due to high commodity prices  the acquisition cost per boe was around per boe  contributing to the higher dd a rate 
in addition  most of our future development cost estimates on our proved undeveloped reserves have been increased to reflect the rising costs in the industry 
our dd a rate on a per boe basis increased between and  primarily due to the higher percentage of expenditures on offshore properties during and the first six months of  which have historically had higher overall finding and development costs  and an increase in certain of our future development cost estimates to reflect the rising costs in the industry 
although the average dd a rate was similar to the dd a rate of per boe during the fourth quarter of  there were significant fluctuations during the year resulting from the offshore sale as the sales proceeds were credited to the full cost pool and upward adjustments in future development costs primarily to reflect cost inflation in the industry 
our dd a rate for our co

our net effective tax rate was lower than our estimated statutory rates due primarily to our enhanced oil recovery eor tax credits we earn related to our tertiary operations and to a lesser degree  to a new manufacturing deduction that became allowable in for oil and gas producing activities covered by the american jobs creation act of our current income tax expense represents anticipated cash payment due to alternative minimum taxes 
during the third quarter of  we recognized approximately million of current income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore properties  which was a gain for income tax purposes 
the taxes on the offshore sale were primarily alternative minimum taxes as we were able to offset the related regular tax with our net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had utilized all of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  but had an estimated million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward 
since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices  we do not expect to earn any eor credits during because of the high oil prices during  which we estimate will raise our effective tax rate 
we will be able to utilize the eor credit carryforwards in the future to reduce our cash taxes 
if oil prices remain at current levels or increase further in the future  we will not earn any additional eor credits and once our existing eor credits are utilized  our cash taxes will also increase

from time to time  we enter into various derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
these contracts have consisted of price floors  collars and fixed price swaps 
historically  we hedged up to of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt 
for and beyond  we have entered into fewer derivative contracts  primarily because of our strong financial position resulting from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations 
when we make a significant acquisition  we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage  up to  of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment 
as of december   the only derivative contracts we have in place relate to the million acquisition that closed on january   on which we entered into contracts to cover of the estimated proved producing production at the time we signed the purchase and sale agreement 
while these derivative contracts related to the acquisition represent less than of our estimated production  they are intended to help protect our acquisition economics related to the first three years of production from the proved producing reserves that we acquired

based on nymex crude oil futures prices at december   we would expect to make future cash payments of million on our crude oil commodity derivative contracts 
if crude oil futures prices were to decline by  we would expect to receive a payment under our crude oil commodity derivative contracts of million  and if futures prices were to increase by we would expect to pay million 
we did not have any nymex natural gas commodity derivative contracts outstanding at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements 
full cost method of accounting  depletion and depreciation and oil and natural gas reserves businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting 
in general  the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment 
under the full cost method  all geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool  whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred 
in the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method follows the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the full cost pool net book value of oil and gas properties is measured against future cash flows discounted at using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
the financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies 
in our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities  we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues  production  capitalized costs and operating expenses 
we calculate these estimates with our best available data  which includes  among other things  
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations production reports  price posting  information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices and analysis of historical results and trends 
while management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates  there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by the purchaser pipeline  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry  many of which will require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
under full cost accounting  the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures 
over the last four years  denbury s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately of the previous year s estimates and have been both positive and negative 
changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities 
for instance  between and  commodity prices rebounded from the prior year s fall  resulting in an increase to our reserve quantities of approximately mmboe 
during  and  the change related to commodity prices was virtually zero  less than in prior years  as prices were relatively high each year end 
these changes in quantities affect our dd a rate and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation 
for example  we estimate that a increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter dd a rate from per bbl to approximately per bbl and a decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our dd a rate to approximately per bbl 
also  reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks 
there can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven 
in some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence  including production testing  is required in order to classify the reserves as proven 
in other cases  properties such as certain of our potential tertiary recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them primarily because we have not yet completed a specific plan for development or firmly scheduled such development 
we have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally  which normally means it is scheduled within the next one to two years or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects 
therefore  particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery our co operations  there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not 
we also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices  which are usually significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report 
this also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves  which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment  as was the case during the last three year ends 
see depletion  depreciation and amortization under results of operations above for a further discussion 
all of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our dd a rate  full cost ceiling test calculation  borrowing base and financial statements 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells  and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
sfas no 
requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our dd a expense in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits and prior to year end  net operating loss carryforwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
a increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our income taxes 
oil and gas derivative contracts we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production 
these contracts have historically consisted of options  in the form of price floors or collars  and fixed price swaps 
under sfas no 
 every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective 
prior to  we applied hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts  thereby recording a significant portion of the fair value changes to equity instead of income 
we recognized losses on ineffectiveness on our hedges of  for and million for we measured and computed hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
if a hedging instrument became ineffective  hedge accounting was discontinued and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remained in accumulated other comprehensive income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise expired 
if we determined it probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument were recognized in earnings immediately 
as of january   we abandoned hedge accounting 
this means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings 
while we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we had continued to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by sfas no 
 we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost  time and effort to comply with hedge accounting 
during  we recognized expense of million related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts 
for our prior two most recently completed fiscal years  if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts  or if none of our derivative contracts had qualified for hedge accounting treatment  we estimate that our net income would have increased or decreased for and by approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates

however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective application method described in the statement 
under the modified prospective method  we will apply the standard to new awards granted or modified effective january  also  we will recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of december  over the remaining service periods 
at january   we had million of unearned compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards 
this compensation cost will be recognized over the remaining vesting period  which is estimated to be approximately million during  million during  million during and million during these amounts do not include the impact of any new awards granted in sfas no 
r also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may serve to reduce denbury s future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future  however  it will not have an impact on the company s overall cash flows
