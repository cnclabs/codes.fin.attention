 the company has presented the operations of first bank of delaware as discontinued operations starting with the first quarter on january  the first bank of delaware was spun off  effective january  all assets  liabilities and equity of first bank of delaware were spun off as an independent company  trading on the otc market under the stock symbol fbod 
shareholders received one share of stock in first bank of delaware  for every share owned of the company 
the short term loan and tax refund lines of business were accordingly transferred after that date 
however  republic may continue to purchase tax refund anticipation loans from the first bank of delaware 
loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal  reduced by unearned income and an allowance for loan losses 
interest on loans is calculated based upon the principal amounts outstanding 
the company defers and amortizes certain origination and commitment fees  and certain direct loan origination costs over the contractual life of the related loan 
this results in an adjustment of the related loans yield 
loans are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance of interest and principal by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
generally  in the case of non accrual loans  cash received is applied to reduce the principal outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibles of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent loan losses 
management s evaluations of the allowance for loan losses consider such factors as an examination of the portfolio  past loss experience  the results of the most recent regulatory examination  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities at the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are realized or settled 
in addition  a deferred tax asset is recorded to reflect the future benefit of net operating loss carry forwards 
the deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s income from continuing operations increased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
the improvement reflected an million  or  increase in total interest income  reflecting higher rates and a increase in average loans outstanding 
interest expense increased only million as the company moved away from relatively high cost federal home loan bank fhlb advances  replacing them with overnight fhlb borrowings and deposits 
accordingly  net interest income increased million 
partially offsetting the increase in net interest income were the provision for loan losses up million  non interest income down approximately  and non interest expenses up million 
the increased net income resulted in a return on average assets and average equity from continuing operations of and respectively in compared to and respectively in analysis of net interest income historically  the company s earnings have depended primarily upon republic s net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis  setting forth for the periods i average assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  ii interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  iii average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities  and iv republic s net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets 
averages are computed based on daily balances 
non accrual loans are included in average loans receivable 
yields are not adjusted for tax equivalency  as republic had no tax exempt income 
however  republic may have such income in the future

the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated 
for purposes of this table  changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates

the increase in yields on assets resulted primarily from the basis points of increases in short term interest rates between the two periods 
the decrease in the cost of funds reflected the impact of the maturity of relatively high cost fhlb advances 
a total of million of fhlb advances which carried an average interest rate of matured beginning the third quarter of through the first quarter of the company s net interest income increased million  or  to million for from million for as shown in the rate volume table above  the increase in net interest income was due primarily to the increased volume of loans 
higher rates on loans resulted primarily from variable rate loans which immediately adjust to increases in the prime rate 
other borrowings expense decreased as a result of the maturity of the million of fhlb advances  which were only partially replaced by lower cost overnight fhlb borrowings 
average interest earning assets amounted to million for and million for substantially all of the million increase resulted from loan growth 
the company s total interest income increased million  or  to million for  from million interest and fees on loans increased million to million for  from million for the majority of the increase resulted from a increase in average loan balances 
for  average loan balances amounted to million  compared to million in the balance of the increase in interest on loans resulted primarily from the repricing of the variable rate loan portfolio to higher short term market interest rates 
interest and dividends on investment securities decreased  to million for this decline reflected the million  or  decrease in average investment securities outstanding to million for from million for interest on federal funds sold and other interest earning assets increased  or  due to increases in short term market interest rates 
the company s total interest expense increased million  or  to million for  from million for the increase in interest expense primarily reflected higher deposit balances  which more than offset the impact of the maturity of million of fhlb advances  with an average rate of 
those advances were replaced by overnight fhlb borrowings and deposits which generally bore interest at or less 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million for  versus million for  or an increase of million 
the increase reflected additional funding utilized for loan growth 
average transaction account balances increased million which facilitated a million decrease in other borrowings 
a portion of the increase in average transaction accounts is likely short term 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for that decrease resulted notwithstanding the increase in market interest rates due primarily to the maturity of the average rate fhlb advances 
all such advances had matured by february money market and savings interest expense increased million to million in from related average balances increased million  or  in those respective periods  and accounted for the majority of the increase 
the balance of the increase reflected the higher short term interest rate environment  which while increased  lagged the general increase in short term market interest rates 
accordingly  rates on total interest bearing deposits increased basis points in compared to  while short term rates increased approximately basis points between those periods 
interest expense on time deposits certificates of deposit increased million  or to million for from million for  as a result of increased average balances and rates 
average time deposits increased million  or  between those periods 
average rates increased only basis points between those periods  as increases lagged the increases in short term market interest rates 
interest expense on other borrowings decreased million to million for  as a result of decreased average balances and rates 
average other borrowings  substantially all fhlb advances and overnight borrowings  decreased million  or  between and these reductions in balances reflected the increases in transaction accounts  which were utilized as a less costly funding source for loan growth 
as the million of average rate fhlb advances matured  these were replaced with less costly transaction accounts  or overnight fhlb borrowings 
overnight borrowings were available at a significant lower rate than the maturing fhlb advances and lowered the rates on other borrowings to in compared to in provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the known and estimated inherent losses in the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million in the provision reflected million for losses on tax refund loans  and amounts required to increase the allowance for loan growth 
it also reflected the impact of the approximately  of tax refund loan recoveries on loans previously charged off and a  commercial loan recovery 
the prior year net credit of  for the provision resulted from a large recovery credited to the allowance for loan losses  representing the previously charged off balance of the related loan 
the recovery resulted in an allowance balance which exceeded the level deemed necessary by the company s methodology 
the required adjustment to the allowance resulted in the net credit to the provision 
non interest income total non interest income decreased  to million for  versus million for the decrease reflected a non recurring million legal settlement recorded in the resulting reduction was partially offset by an increase of  in service fees on deposit accounts  a one time  award in a lawsuit  a  gain on call of security  and an increase of  in loan advisory and servicing fees  all in non interest expenses total non interest expenses increased million or to million for  from million for salaries and employee benefits increased million or  to million for  from million for that increase reflected additional salary expense related to commercial loan and deposit production  including related support staff  and staff for the new branch location 
it also reflected annual merit increases which are targeted at approximately 
occupancy expense increased  or  to million for  versus million for the increase reflected an additional branch location which was opened in the first quarter depreciation expense increased  or to million for  versus  for the majority of the increase resulted from the write off of assets determined to have shorter lives than originally expected 
it also reflected the additional branch location  and purchase of commercial loan and other software 
legal fees decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in  resulting from reduced fees on a number of different matters 
other real estate expense decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in the decrease resulted from an asset write down recorded in advertising expense increased  or  to  in  compared to  in the increase reflected an increase in the number of advertisements 
data processing expense increased  or  to  in  compared to  in the increase reflected the outsourcing of check processing 
in previous periods  republic employees had performed these functions  and related expense was included in salaries and benefits 
taxes  other increased  or to  for versus  for the increase reflected an increase in pennsylvania shares tax  which is assessed at an annual rate of on a year moving average of regulatory capital 
other operating expenses increased  or to million for  from million for professional fees increased approximately  reflecting expense connected with sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition  the increase also reflected  of additional printing and supplies expense 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for continuing operations increased million  to million for  from million for that increase was primarily the result of the increase in pre tax income 
the effective tax rates in those periods were and respectively 
the effective rate was slightly lower in the period due to the impact of a relatively fixed amount of tax exempt income on lower income 
results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s income from continuing operations increased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
while net interest income decreased million in reflecting the termination of short term consumer loan participation  the related provision for loan losses was million less 
the company ceased purchasing short term consumer loans  which resulted in these changes 
in addition  a favorable judgment on a lawsuit related to a charged off loan resulted in million of other income in the increased net income resulted in a return on average assets and average equity from continuing operations of and respectively in compared to and respectively in financial condition december  compared to december  total assets increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  this net increase reflected higher balances in loans and federal funds sold 
loans the loan portfolio  which represents the company s largest asset  is its most significant source of interest income 
the company s lending strategy is to focus on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services 
total loans increased million  or  to million at december   versus million at december  the increase reflected million  or  of growth in commercial and construction loans 
the loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate  construction loans  residential mortgages  automobile loans  home improvement loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  overdraft lines of credit and others 
republic s commercial loans typically range between  and  but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to republic s legal lending limit of approximately million at december  individual customers may have several loans that are secured by different collateral which are in total subject to that lending limit 
the aggregate amount of those relationships that exceeded million at december   was million 
the million threshold approximates of total capital and reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline 
investment securities investment securities available for sale are investments which may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions and for liquidity and other purposes 
the company s investment securities available for sale consist primarily of u 
s government debt securities  us government agency issued mortgage backed securities  and debt securities  which include corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
available for sale securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from year end this decrease reflected principal repayments on mortgage backed securities 
at december  and december   the portfolio had net unrealized gains of  and  respectively 
investment securities held to maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
these investments are carried at amortized cost 
the held to maturity portfolio consists primarily of debt securities and stocks 
at december   securities held to maturity totaled  a decrease of  or  from  at year end the decline reflected a reduction in the amount of debt securities 
at both dates  respective carrying values approximated market values 
fhlb stock republic is required to maintain fhlb stock in proportion to its outstanding debt to fhlb 
when the debt is repaid  the purchase price of the stock is refunded 
at december   fhlb stock totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  cash and due from banks cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold comprise this category which consists of the company s most liquid assets 
the aggregate amount in these three categories increased by million  to million at december   from million at december  federal funds sold increased by million to million from million  respectively  reflecting the increase in liquidity 
other interest earning restricted cash other interest earning restricted cash represented funds provided to fund an offsite atm network for which the company was compensated 
at december   the balance was versus million at december  fixed assets bank premises and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  remained at million at december   compared to december  other real estate owned the oreo property represents retail stores in a strip mall 
the property remained at  at december   compared to december  bank owned life insurance at december   the value of the insurance was million  an increase of  or  from million at december  the increase reflected income earned on the insurance policies 
other assets other assets decreased by million to million at december   from million at december   principally resulting from the collection of receivables in the fourth quarter of deposits deposits  which include non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market  savings and time deposits including some brokered deposits  are republic s major source of funding 
deposits are generally solicited from the company s market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers  with a primary focus on multi product relationships 
total deposits increased by million to million at december   from million at december  average core deposits increased or million more than the prior year end to million in time deposits increased million  or  to million at december   versus million at the prior year end 
core deposit growth benefited from the company s business development efforts and bank consolidations in the philadelphia market that management believes continue to leave some customers underserved 
fhlb borrowings and overnight advances fhlb borrowings and overnight advances are used to supplement deposit generation 
fhlb term borrowing by republic totaled and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s remaining term borrowing matured in the first quarter of republic also had short term borrowings overnight of million at december  versus million at the prior year end 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million to million at december   versus million at december   after the effect of the fbd spin off 
this increase was primarily the result of net income of million 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in commitments reflects an increase in commercial lending 
however  commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time deposits employment agreement former ceo serp loan commitments standby letters of credit total as of december   the company had entered into non cancelable lease agreements for its main office and operations center and nine republic retail branch facilities  expiring through october   including renewal options 
the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum annual rental payments required under these leases are million through the year the company has entered into an employment agreement with the ceo of the company 
the aggregate commitment for future salaries and benefits under this employment agreement at december  is approximately  the company and republic are from time to time a party plaintiff or defendant to lawsuits that are in the normal course of business 
while any litigation involves an element of uncertainty  management  after reviewing pending actions with its legal counsel  is of the opinion that the liability of the company and republic  if any  resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company and republic 
at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there is amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
the company attempts to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
the company typically defines interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that reprice within one year or less 
the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is known as the interest sensitivity gap gap 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities repricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets repricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap ratio suggests the converse 
static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time 
however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income since changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about repricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at either their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest repricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or repricing term and can be withdrawn or repriced at any time 
management estimates the repricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and other deposit behavior assumptions 
these deposits are not considered to reprice simultaneously and  accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table below 
the company attempts to manage its assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
management presently believes that the effect on republic of any future fall in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  would be detrimental since republic does not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a positive effect on republic  due to repricing of certain assets  primarily adjustable rate loans and federal funds sold  and a possible lag in the repricing of core deposits not assumed in the model 
the following tables present a summary of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december  for purposes of these tables  the company has used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage backed securities 
the interest rate on the trust preferred securities is variable and adjusts semi annually

such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental 
in addition to the gap analysis  the company utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such a yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling the company has estimated net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments at december  the company has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon immediate and sustained changes in interest rates rate shocks 
rate shocks assume that all of the interest rate increases or decreases occur on the first day of the period modeled and remain at that level for the entire period 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the years ending december  excluding the impact of tax refund loans 
percent change rate shocks to interest rates the company s management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the company s estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
periodically  the company may and does make significant changes to underlying assumptions  which are wholly judgmental 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment  and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources the company is required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets  was and at december  and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december  and  the company exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under both federal and pennsylvania state guidelines 
under frb and fdic regulations  a bank and a holding company are deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least 
at december  and  the company s leverage ratio was and  respectively 
accordingly  at december  and  the company was considered well capitalized under frb and fdic regulations 
on november   republic first bancorp  inc  through a pooled offering with sandler o neill partners  issued million of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of the subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the purpose of the issuance was to increase capital as a result of the company s continued loan and core deposit growth 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
the company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years  without a prepayment penalty  notwithstanding their final year maturity 
the interest rate is variable and adjustable semi annually at over the month london interbank offered rate libor 
the shareholders equity of the company as of december   totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december   after the effect of the fbd spin off 
this increase of million reflected net income of million 
that net income increased the book value per share of the company s common stock from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding restated for stock dividend  to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december  both periods restated for stock dividend 
regulatory capital requirements federal banking agencies impose three minimum capital requirements on the company s risk based capital ratios based on total capital  tier capital  and a leverage capital ratio 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks

spin off of fbd effective january  management believes that the company and republic met  as of december  and  all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the fdic categorized republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification  which management believes would have changed republic s category 
the company and republic s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on republic s loan customers and republic s ability to manage its interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
in addition to the above minimum capital requirements  the federal reserve bank approved a rule that became effective on december   implementing a statutory requirement that federal banking regulators take specified prompt corrective action when an insured institution s capital level falls below certain levels 
the rule defines five capital categories based on several of the above capital ratios 
republic currently exceeds the levels required for a bank to be classified as well capitalized 
however  the federal reserve bank may consider other criteria when determining such classifications  which criteria could result in a downgrading in such classifications 
the company s equity to assets ratio decreased from as of december   to as of december  the decrease at year end was a result of the increase in loans for the company s average equity to assets ratio for  and was  and  respectively 
the company s average return on equity for  and was  and  respectively  and its average return on assets for  and  was  and  respectively 
liquidity financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day to day requirements of depositors and borrowers  time investment purchases to market conditions and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
the most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require the company to maintain certain liquidity ratios such that republic maintains available funds  or can obtain available funds at reasonable rates  in order to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  the company has formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of republic s board of directors and senior management  which monitors such ratios 
the purpose of the committee is  in part  to monitor republic s liquidity and adherence to the ratios in addition to managing relative interest rate risk 
the alco meets at least quarterly 
the company s most liquid assets  comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   republic estimated that in excess of million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ended june  additionally  the majority of its securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through pledges to the fhlb to access republic s line of credit 
funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the facilities of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
at december   republic had million in unused lines of credit available under arrangements with the fhlb and with correspondent banks  compared to million at december  the reduction in available lines resulted from republic s increased level of overnight borrowings against these lines 
notwithstanding these reductions  management believes it satisfactorily exceeds regulatory liquidity guidelines 
these lines of credit enable republic to purchase funds for short to long term needs at rates often lower than other sources and require pledging of securities or loan collateral 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments 
in addition  the company can use term borrowings to replace these borrowed funds 
republic s target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of republic s interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
republic has established a rarely used contingency line of credit with a correspondent bank to assist in managing republic s liquidity position 
that line of credit totaled million at december  republic had drawn down on this line at december  additionally  republic has established a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
that million capacity is reduced by advances outstanding to arrive at the unused line of credit available 
as of december  and  republic had borrowed million and million  respectively from the fhlb 
investment securities represent a primary source of liquidity for republic 
accordingly  investment decisions generally reflect liquidity over other considerations 
operating cash flows are primarily derived from cash provided from net income during the year and are another source of liquidity 
the company s primary short term funding sources are certificates of deposit and its securities portfolio 
the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources are as follows 
republic has historically been able to generate certificates of deposit by matching philadelphia market rates or paying a premium rate of to basis points over those market rates 
it is anticipated that this source of liquidity will continue to be available  however  the incremental cost may vary depending on market conditions 
the company s securities portfolio is also available for liquidity  most likely as collateral for fhlb advances 
because of the fhlb s aaa rating  it is unlikely those advances would not be available 
but even if they are not  numerous investment companies would likely provide repurchase agreements up to the amount of the market value of the securities 
the alco committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity of republic 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring republic s interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
investment securities portfolio republic s investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk 
the company attempts to maximize earnings while minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
the company s alco monitors and approves all security purchases 
the decline in securities in and was a result of the company s strategy to reduce the amount of the investment securities by not replacing mortgage backed securities prepayments in the lower interest rate environment 
the company instead was able to increase its commercial loan balances  through increased loan production

a committee of the board of directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained  while approving the majority of commercial loans 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual or as an impaired loan and the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
for non accrual loans which have been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

problem loans consist of loans that are included in performing loans  but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms 
at december   all identified problem loans are included in the preceding table  or are classified as substandard or doubtful  with a reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses see allowance for loan losses 
the following summary shows the impact on interest income of non accrual loans for the periods indicated for the year ended december  interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms interest income included in net income at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to non residential building operators and real estate agents and managers in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others

charge offs on tax refund loans increased to million in  from  in  as a result of increased volume in the tax refund loan program 
recoveries on tax refund loans increased to  in  from  in as a result of growing cumulative charge offs 
management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that is management s best estimate of known and inherent losses 
the company s board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by republic s regulators or internal loan review officer  who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
the company has an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
loan review is conducted by a loan review officer who reports quarterly  directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
republic s management is unable to determine in which loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is accordingly based upon historical experience 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category at december  dollars in thousands allocation of the allowance for loan losses  amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans commercial construction residential real estate consumer and other unallocated total gross loans net of unearned income 
includes loans held for sale 
the methodology utilized to estimate the amount of the allowance for loan losses is as follows the company first applies an estimated loss percentage against all loan categories outstanding 
in  excluding tax refund loans  the company experienced net charge offs to average loans of approximately 
net charge offs excluding short term and tax refund loans  to average loans were and in and while in and  respectively  that ratio was and  substantially all of the charge offs in and  related to two borrowers 
however  of total charge offs in and  subsequent collections amounted to of such charge offs 
in the absence of sustained charge off history  management estimates loss percentages based upon the purpose and or collateral of various commercial loan categories 
while such loss percentages exceed the percentages suggested by historical experience  the company maintained those percentages in the company will continue to evaluate these percentages and may adjust these estimates on the basis of charge off history  economic conditions or other relevant factors 
the company also provides specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
also  the company may estimate and recognize reserve allocations above these regulatory reserve percentages based upon any factor that might impact the loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
in  the unallocated component increased  to  primarily for economic reasons 
at december   based upon some sustained stabilization and improvement in certain economic trends  the unallocated component decreased to  from  at the prior year end 
as december   the unallocated component increased  to  from  at december  total loans at december   increased to million from million at the prior year end 
the unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above 
the unallocated portion is more subjective and requires a high degree of management judgment and experience 
management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions  industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
the company attempts to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of its loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis  and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  there is no assurance that information on potential problems would be available 
the company s portfolios of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups

fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under fin if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management previously determined that republic first capital trust i  utilized for the company s  of pooled trust preferred securities issuance  qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin republic first capital trust i issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the company 
republic first capital trust i holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in republic first capital trust i is currently included in the company s consolidated balance sheet and statements of income 
the company has evaluated the impact of fin and concluded it should continue to consolidate republic first capital trust i as of december   in part due to its ability to call the preferred stock prior to the mandatory redemption date and thereby benefit from a decline in required dividend yields 
the company adopted the provisions under the revised interpretation in the first quarter of accordingly  the company no longer consolidates rfct as of march  fin r precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if the company has the right to a majority of rfct s expected residual returns 
the deconsolidation resulted in the investment in the common stock of rfct to be included in other assets as of september  and the corresponding increase in outstanding debt of  in addition  the income received on the company s common stock investment is included in other income 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
the federal reserve has issued final guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by rfct as a result of the adoption of fin r 
the final rule would retain the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but would enact other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
the rule would take effect march   however  a five year transition period starting march  and leading up to that date would allow bank holding companies to continue to count trust preferred securities as tier capital after applying fin r 
management has evaluated the effects of the final rule and does not anticipate a material impact on its capital ratios 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in november  the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position fas no 
and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp addresses when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  with earlier application permitted

effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is the company s need and ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
