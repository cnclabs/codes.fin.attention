item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and ciena s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview we have undertaken a number of significant steps to position ciena to take advantage of new opportunities in the communications networking equipment market 
these steps have included the expansion of our product portfolio and the enhancement of product functionality through internal research and development and acquisitions 
our strategy has been to build upon our historical expertise in core optical networking by adding complementary products  software and services that enable our customers to transition their network infrastructure to support new high bandwidth applications and network convergence 
this strategy has enabled us to increase penetration of our historical telecommunications customers with additional products and to broaden our addressable markets to include participants in the cable  government and enterprise segments 
it also has resulted in increased revenues and improved gross margin 
our fiscal financial results reflect the effects of this strategy 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue was million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing the seventh consecutive sequential quarterly increase 
revenue for fiscal reflects our first full year of sales of products added from our acquisitions of catena networks and internet photonics during the third quarter of revenue in fiscal also reflects increased sales of our traditional core transport and switching products 
during fiscal  bellsouth  verizon and saic as a result of our work on the united states defense information systems agency s global information grid bandwidth expansion gig be project  each represented more than of ciena s total revenue  and in the aggregate 
in  ciena was chosen as a preferred supplier for the optical transmission portion of bts st century network  or cn 
this project is based largely on deploying next generation equipment and will permit bt to migrate its services from a public switched telephone network to a single  multiservice  internet based protocol network 
while we recognized no revenue in as a result of this project  we expect to recognize significant revenues from this project in fiscal gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was 
increased gross margin reflects favorable product mix  cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
we continue to focus on aggressive cost reductions across all of our product lines  including product redesign relating to our long haul transport and metro transport products  in an effort to maintain and build upon our gross margin improvement during fiscal we expect continued revenue growth and general improvement in our financial results in fiscal as a result of what appears to be a trend toward larger orders from our telecommunications service provider customers  however  we may experience increased quarterly fluctuation in our revenue and gross margin during the year 
fluctuations may be caused by the size and timing of these orders  as well as the timing of satisfaction of contractual acceptance criteria 
as a result  in any given quarter  our levels of inventory  operating expenses and general overhead may be high relative to revenue 
calendar year witnessed a considerable increase in consolidation activity among us communications service providers 
this activity included the merger of sbc and at t and the merger of verizon and mci  all four of which have been significant customers for ciena during prior periods 
mergers of large carriers will have a major impact in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry  the historical customer base for our products 
these mergers also have the effect of further reducing the number of potential communications service provider customers seeking to purchase networking equipment from vendors and continuing to concentrate customer purchasing power 
it is too soon to determine the near term and long term effects  if any  that these proposed consolidations will have on our business and revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that developments in the market for broadband loop carrier products  particularly outside of the united states  would require us to make a substantial commitment of research and development resources in order to compete successfully in this market with our cn next generation broadband access platform 
given the uncertainties associated with this international market and the magnitude of the investment required  we determined it would not be cost effective to make such investment and suspended research and development for this product 
as a result of this decision  we incurred a goodwill impairment of million related to our broadband access group bbg in fiscal we also incurred long lived asset impairments of million in fiscal  primarily related to certain intangibles associated with our bbg business unit 
notwithstanding  we continue to invest in our broadband access products and seek to leverage the success of our cnx broadband dsl system through ip related feature and functionality enhancements 
we also have taken a number of significant steps  including headcount reductions  office closures and outsourcing manufacturing resources  geared toward reducing our ongoing operating expenses 
as of october   headcount was  down from  at october   and  at october  our efforts to reduce headcount and operating expense have resulted in restructuring charges of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect to take additional steps to reduce our operating expense and may incur additional restructuring costs during future periods 
in fiscal  we also took steps toward the establishment of a development facility in india in order to further improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our research and development operations 
in early november  we effected a headcount reduction of employees  the majority of whom worked in our kanata  canada facility 
on october   we accelerated the vesting of unvested out of the money stock options for approximately million shares held by employees  officers and directors under our equity compensation plans 
for purposes of the acceleration  options with an exercise price greater than per share were deemed out of the money 
the accelerated options  which are considered fully vested as of october   have exercise prices ranging from to per share  and a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we accelerated these options to avoid recognizing future compensation expense associated with these options upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  for fiscal while we expect the adoption of sfas r to increase our stock compensation expense beginning in fiscal  our acceleration of vesting is expected to reduce the stock option expense we otherwise would have been required to record in future periods by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of our outstanding convertible notes  due february   in open market transactions for million 
we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of million  which consists of the million gain from the repurchase of the notes less a write off of million of associated debt issuance costs 
we repurchased an additional million in principal amount  in open market transactions  during november and december these additional repurchases used approximately million in cash and resulted in a gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of million  which consists of the million gain from the repurchase of the notes less a write off of million of associated debt issuance costs 
we intend to continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to achieve cost savings relating to the repayment of our outstanding convertible notes when it is prudent to do so 
we believe that the execution of our strategy has resulted in a significantly changed company  better positioned to compete in a dynamic market 
while the execution of this strategy has not been without risk and cost  we believe that this strategy has resulted in a fundamentally stronger company  better positioned for sustainable revenue growth and a return to profitability 
while we have more work to do in the execution of our strategy  we believe that our improved financial performance during fiscal provides a strong base upon which can build in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  training costs  royalties  license fees  direct technical support costs  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and overhead related to manufacturing  technical support and engineering  furnishing and installation operations

these workforce reductions were taken as part of our plan to reduce our costs and align resources with market opportunities 
we expect to take additional steps to reduce our operating expense and may incur additional restructuring costs during future periods

liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments in thousands october  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investment the decrease in total cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments during fiscal was primarily related to million of cash consumed in operating activities and million of cash used for the repurchase of our convertible notes 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months 
the following sections review the significant activities that had an impact on our cash during fiscal operating activities the following tables set forth in thousands significant components of our million of cash used in operating activities for fiscal net loss year ended october  net loss our fiscal net loss included the significant non cash charges summarized in the following table in thousands goodwill impairment long lived asset impairment amortization of intangibles depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements total significant non cash charges accounts receivable  net cash consumed by accounts receivable  net increased from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to increased sales  and higher days sales outstanding dso 
ciena s dso for periods ending october  and october  were days and days  respectively 
increased dso s were primarily affected by large shipments of product during the last month of our fiscal quarter rather than extended payment terms 
we expect that our accounts receivable  net and dsos may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in fiscal  but generally increase during fiscal  due to the size and timing of orders  the timing of satisfaction of contractual acceptance criteria  and extended payment terms 
october  increase decrease accounts receivable  net inventory  net cash consumed by inventory  net increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased demand  significantly offset by improvement in inventory turns 
ciena s inventory turns for the periods ending october  and october  were turns per year and turns per year  respectively 
this improvement in inventory turns was primarily related to the increased outsourcing of our manufacturing process 
we expect cash consumed by inventory to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in fiscal  but generally increase during fiscal  due to increases in finished goods inventory located at customer facilities awaiting contractual acceptance 
october  increase decrease raw materials work in process finished goods gross inventory reserve for excess and obsolescence net inventory restructuring and unfavorable lease commitments ciena used million associated with liabilities related to restructured facilities and million associated with unfavorable lease commitments in fiscal these payments were attributable to ciena s ongoing obligations related to previously restructured facilities and unfavorable lease commitments assumed in acquisitions 
the following table reflects the balances of liabilities for our restructured facilities and unfavorable lease commitments and the change in this balance from fiscal to fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we agreed to pay million in connection with a termination of our obligations under a lease for our former fremont  ca facility 
as a result  we expect cash used in connection with liabilities related to restructured facilities to increase in the first quarter of fiscal october  increase decrease restructuring liabilities unfavorable lease commitments long term restructuring liabilities long term unfavorable lease commitments total restructuring liabilities and unfavorable lease commitments financing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal was primarily related to the repurchase of million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes  due february  these repurchases occurred in open market transactions and used million in cash 
at october   an aggregate principal amount of approximately million remained outstanding 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of october  in thousands less than one to three three to total one year years five years thereafter convertible notes operating leases purchase obligations total our convertible notes  due february   had an aggregate principal value of million at october  and include interest at payable on a semi annual basis on february and august of each year 
purchase commitments related to amounts we are obligated to pay to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory 
we repurchased an additional million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes  in open market transactions  during november and december these additional repurchases used approximately million in cash and resulted in a gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of million  which consists of the million gain from the repurchase of the notes less a write off of million of associated debt issuance costs 
we intend to continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to achieve cost savings relating to the repayment of our outstanding convertible notes when it is prudent to do so 
some of our commercial commitments  including some of the future minimum payments set forth above  are secured by standby letters of credit 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment expiration date as of october  in thousands less than one to three to total one year three years five years thereafter standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires ciena to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
during fiscal  reevaluation of certain estimates led to the effects described below 
revenue recognition some of our communications networking equipment is integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to the equipment through our maintenance contracts for these products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our service revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
reserve for inventory obsolescence ciena writes down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted sales for certain products 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs for shorter delivery terms  we are currently transitioning our manufacturing operations from our build to order model used in recent years  to a build to forecast model for some of our product lines  including core transport and switching and metro transport 
this change in our inventory purchases exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order those products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
if actual market conditions differ from those we have assumed  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs or benefits 
restructuring as part of its restructuring costs  ciena provides for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the fair value of the minimum future lease payments under our contracted lease obligations  offset by the fair value of the estimated sublease payments that we may receive 
due to the continued excess supply of commercial properties in certain markets where our unused facilities are located  we have reduced our estimate of the total future sublease payments we will receive 
as a result  we recorded an additional restructuring cost of million in fiscal as of october   ciena s accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
the total minimum lease payments for these restructured facilities are million 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of our leases  which range from one month to thirteen years 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  we may be required to recognize additional restructuring costs associated with these facilities 
goodwill at october   ciena s consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
due to ciena s reorganization into operating segments  sfas requires that we assign goodwill to ciena s reporting units 
ciena has determined its operating segments and reporting units are the same 
in accordance with sfas ciena tests each reporting unit s goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
we incurred a goodwill impairment of million related to bbg in fiscal this impairment was related to operating results  forecasts and business factors associated with bbg and our decision to suspend research and development for its cn next generation broadband access platform 
if actual market conditions differ or forecasts change at the time of our annual assessment in fiscal or in periods prior to our annual assessment  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges 
intangible assets as of october   ciena s consolidated balance sheet included million in other intangible assets  net 
we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets such as equipment  furniture  fixtures  and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas in accordance with sfas  ciena tests each intangible asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  events and changes in circumstances indicated that intangible asset carrying amounts assigned to bbg were not be recoverable  and  accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
if actual market conditions differ or forecasts change  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
investments as of october   ciena s minority investments in privately held technology companies were million 
these investments are generally carried at cost because ciena owns less than of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over any of these companies 
these investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by ciena and such markets may never materialize or become significant 
ciena could lose its entire investment in some or all of these companies 
ciena monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary 
ciena recorded a net charge of million during fiscal  from a decline in the fair value of certain equity investments that was determined to be other than temporary 
if market conditions  expected financial performance or the competitive position of the companies in which we invest deteriorate  ciena may be required to record an additional charge in future periods 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   ciena has recorded a valuation allowance of billion against our gross deferred tax assets of billion 
we calculated the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence such as operating results during the most recent three year period is given more weight than forecasted results  due to our current lack of visibility and the degree of uncertainty that we will achieve the level of future profitability needed to record the deferred assets 
our cumulative loss in the most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure in the footnotes to financial statements is no longer an alternative 
ciena is required to adopt sfas r effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all prior periods presented  or for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
prior to the effective date of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 as permitted by sfas  and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options during fiscal accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will cause our reported stock compensation cost to materially increase beginning in our first quarter of fiscal and will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas also carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not a change in accounting principle 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  ciena does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  ciena does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  ciena does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results and percentage of revenue represented by certain items in ciena s statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about ciena s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
ciena is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
ciena does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
ciena maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  ciena faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and if our exposure increases  adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on ciena s financial results 
historically  ciena s primary exposures have been related to non dollar denominated operating expenses in canada  europe and asia where ciena sells primarily in us dollars 
although we do not currently engage in hedging transactions  ciena is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency if this exposure becomes material 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of ciena related to non dollar denominated currencies were not material 
therefore  we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on ciena s financial position
