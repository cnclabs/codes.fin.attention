company overview quality systems inc  comprised of the qsi division qsi division and a wholly owned subsidiary  nextgen healthcare information systems  inc nextgen division collectively  the company  we  our  or us develops and markets healthcare information systems that automate certain aspects of medical and dental practices  networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations pho s and management service organizations mso s  ambulatory care centers  community health centers  and medical and dental schools 
the company  a california corporation formed in  was founded with an early focus on providing information systems to dental group practices 
in the mid s  we capitalized on the increasing focus on medical cost containment and further expanded our information processing systems to serve the medical market 
in the mid s we made two acquisitions that accelerated our penetration of the medical market 
these two acquisitions formed the basis for the nextgen division 
today  we serve the medical and dental markets through our two divisions 
the two divisions operate largely as stand alone operations  with each division maintaining its own distinct product lines  product platforms  development  implementation and support teams  sales staffing  and branding 
the two divisions share the resources of our corporate office which includes a variety of accounting and other administrative functions 
additionally  there are a small number of clients who are simultaneously utilizing software from each of our two divisions 
the qsi division  co located with our corporate headquarters in irvine  california  currently focuses on developing  marketing and supporting software suites sold to dental and certain niche medical practices 
in addition  the division supports a number of medical clients that utilize the division s unix based medical practice management software product 
the nextgen division  with headquarters in horsham  pennsylvania  and a second significant location in atlanta  georgia  focuses principally on developing and marketing products and services for medical practices 
both divisions develop and market practice management software which is designed to automate and streamline a number of the administrative functions required for operating a medical or dental practice 
examples of practice management software functions include scheduling and billing capabilities 
it is important to note that in both the medical and dental environments  practice management software systems have already been implemented by the vast majority of practices 
therefore  we actively compete for the replacement market 
in addition  both divisions develop and market software that automates the patient record 
adoption of this software  commonly referred to as clinical software  is in its relatively early stages 
therefore  we are typically competing to replace paper based patient record alternatives as opposed to replacing previously purchased systems 
electronic data interchange edi connectivity products are intended to automate a number of manual  often paper based or telephony intensive communications between patients and or providers and or payors 
two of the more common edi services are forwarding insurance claims electronically from providers to payors and assisting practices with issuing statements to patients 
most client practices utilize at least some of these services from us or one of our competitors 
other edi connectivity services are used more sporadically by client practices 
we typically compete to displace incumbent vendors for claims and statements accounts  and attempt to increase usage of other elements in our edi connectivity product line 
in general  edi services are only sold to those accounts utilizing software from one of our divisions 
the qsi division s practice management software suite utilizes a unix operating system 
its clinical product suite cps utilizes a windows nt operating system and can be fully integrated with the practice management software from each division 
cps incorporates a wide range of clinical tools including  but not limited to  periodontal charting and digital imaging of x ray and inter oral camera images as part of the electronic patient record 
the division develops  markets  and manages our edi connectivity applications 
the qsinet application service provider asp internet offering is also developed and marketed by the division 
our nextgen division develops and sells proprietary electronic medical records software and practice management systems under the nextgen product name 
major product categories of the nextgen suite include electronic medical records nextgen emr  enterprise practice management nextgen epm  enterprise appointment scheduling nextgen eas  enterprise master patient index nextgen epi  nextgen image control system nextgen ics  managed care server nextgen mcs  electronic data interchange  system interfaces  internet operability nextgen web  a patient centric and provider centric web portal solution nextmd com  nextgen express  a version of nextgen emr designed for small practices and nextgen community health solution nextgen chs 
nextgen products utilize microsoft windows technology and can operate in a client server environment as well as via private intranet  the internet  or in an asp environment 
we continue to pursue product enhancement initiatives within each division 
the majority of such expenditures are currently targeted to the nextgen division product line and client base

the nextgen division s revenue grew at and in fiscal and  respectively  while the qsi division s revenue increased by and decreased by in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to the aforementioned software solutions which we offer through our two divisions  each division offers comprehensive hardware and software installation services  maintenance and support services  and system training services 
industry background to compete in the continually changing healthcare environment  providers are increasingly using technology to help maximize the efficiency of their business practices  to assist in enhancing patient care  and to maintain the privacy of patient information 
as the reimbursement environment continues to evolve  more healthcare providers enter into contracts  often with multiple entities  which define the terms under which care is administered and paid for 
the diversity of payor organizations  as well as additional government regulation and changes in reimbursement models  have greatly increased the complexity of pricing  billing  reimbursement  and records management for medical and dental practices 
to operate effectively  healthcare provider organizations must efficiently manage patient care and other information and workflow processes which increasingly extend across multiple locations and business entities 
in response  healthcare provider organizations have placed increasing demands on their information systems 
initially  these information systems automated financial and administrative functions 
as it became necessary to manage patient flow processes  the need arose to integrate back office data with such clinical information as patient test results and office visits 
the company believes information systems must facilitate management of patient information incorporating administrative  financial and clinical information from multiple entities 
in addition  large healthcare organizations increasingly require information systems that can deliver high performance in environments with multiple concurrent computer users 
many existing healthcare information systems were designed for limited administrative tasks such as billing and scheduling and can neither accommodate multiple computing environments nor operate effectively across multiple locations and entities 
we believe that practices that leverage technology to more efficiently handle patient clinical data as well as administrative  financial and other practice management data  will be best able to enhance patient flow  pursue cost efficiencies  and improve quality of care 
as healthcare organizations transition to new computer platforms and newer technologies  we believe such organizations will be migrating toward the implementation of enterprise wide  patient centric computing systems embedded with automated clinical patient records 
company strategy the company s strategy is  at present  to focus on its core software business 
among the key elements central to this strategy are continued development and enhancement of select software solutions in target markets  continued investments in our infrastructure including but not limited to product development  sales  marketing  implementation  and support  continued efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline  and addition of new customers through maintaining and expanding sales  marketing and product development activities 
while these are the key elements of our current strategy  there can be no guarantees that our strategy will not change  or that we will succeed in achieving these goals individually or collectively 
products in response to the growing need for more comprehensive  cost effective healthcare information solutions for physician and dental practices  our systems provide our clients with the ability to redesign patient care and other workflow processes while improving productivity through facilitation of managed access to patient information 
utilizing our proprietary software in combination with third party hardware and software solutions  our products enable the integration of a variety of administrative and clinical information operations 
leveraging more than years of experience in the healthcare information services industry  we believe that we continue to add value by providing our clients with sophisticated  full featured software systems along with comprehensive systems implementation  maintenance and support services 
any single transaction may or may not include software  hardware or services 
practice management systems 
our products consist primarily of proprietary healthcare software applications together with third party hardware and other non industry specific software 
the systems range in capacity from one to thousands of users  allowing us to address the needs of both small and large organizations 
the systems are modular in design and may be expanded to accommodate changing client requirements 
the qsi division s character based practice management system is available in both dental and medical versions and primarily uses the ibm rs central processing unit and ibm s aix version of the unix operating system as a platform for our application software enabling a wide range of flexible and functional systems 
the hardware components  as well as the requisite operating system licenses  are purchased from manufacturers or distributors of those components 
we configure and test the hardware components and incorporate our software and other third party packages into completed systems tailored to accommodate particular client requirements 
we continually evaluate third party hardware components with a view toward utilizing hardware that is functional  reliable and cost effective

cps incorporates windows based client server technology consisting of one or more file servers together with any combination of one or more desktop  laptop  or pen based pc workstations 
the file server s used in connection with cps utilize s a windows nt or windows or windows xp operating system and the hardware is typically a pentium based single or multi processor platform 
based on the server configuration chosen  cps is scalable from one to hundreds of workstations 
a typical configuration may also include redundant disk storage  magnetic tape units  intra and extra oral cameras  digital x ray components  digital scanners  conventional and flat screen displays  and printers 
the hardware components  including the requisite operating system licenses  are purchased from third party manufacturers or distributors either directly by the customer or by us for resale to the customer 
nextgen provides clinical software applications that are complementary to  and are integrated with  our medical practice management offerings and interface with many of the other leading practice management software systems on the market 
the applications incorporated into our practice management solutions and others such as scheduling  eligibility  billing and claims processing are augmented by clinical information captured by nextgen emr  including services rendered and diagnoses used for billing purposes 
we believe that we currently provide a comprehensive information management solution for the medical marketplace 
nextgen emr was developed with client server architecture and a gui and utilizes microsoft windows  windows nt or windows xp on each workstation and either windows  windows nt  windows xp or unix on the database server 
nextgen emr maintains data using industry standard relational database engines such as microsoft sql server or oracle the system is scalable from one to hundreds of workstations 
nextgen emr stores and maintains clinical data including data captured using user customized input templates  scanned or electronically acquired images  including x rays and photographs  data electronically acquired through interfaces with clinical instruments or external systems  other records  documents or notes  including electronically captured handwriting and annotations  and digital voice recordings 
nextgen emr also offers a workflow module  prescription management  automatic document and letter generation  patient education  referral tracking  interfaces to billing and lab systems  physician alerts and reminders  and powerful reporting and data analysis tools 
nextgen express  is a version of nextgen emr designed for small practices 
in may  the nextgen division announced the launch of a new community network technology product named nextgen community health solution nextgen chs 
the nextgen chs facilitates cross enterprise data sharing  enabling individual medical practices in a given community to selectively share critical data such as demographics  referrals  medications lists  allergies  diagnoses  lab results  histories and more 
this is accomplished through a secure  community wide data repository that links health care providers  whether they have the nextgen electronic medical record nextgen emr system  another compatible emr system  or no emr  together with hospitals  payors  labs and other entities 
the product is designed to facilitate a regional health information organization  or rhio 
the result is that for every health care encounter in the community  a patient centric and complete record is accessible for the provider 
the availability  currency and completeness of information plus the elimination of duplicate data entry can lead to significantly improved patient safety  enhanced decision making capabilities  time efficiencies and cost savings 
in fiscal year  we introduced a new service named practice solutions 
this service provides billing services to single and group practice practitioners 
pentium is a registered trademark of intel corporation 
microsoft and sql server is a registered trademark of microsoft corporation 
oracle is a registered trademark of oracle corporation 
connectivity services 
the company makes available electronic data interchange edi capabilities and connectivity services to our customers 
the edi connectivity capabilities encompass direct interfaces between our products and external third party systems  as well as transaction based services 
services include electronic claims submission through our relationships with a number of payors and national claims clearinghouses  electronic patient statement processing  appointment reminder cards and calls  recall cards  patient letters  and other correspondence  electronic insurance eligibility verification  and electronic posting of remittances from insurance carriers into the accounts receivable application 
internet applications 
our nextgen division maintains an internet based consumer health portal  nextmd 
com 
nextmd 
com is a vertical portal for the healthcare industry  linking patients with their physicians  insurers  laboratories  and online pharmacies  while providing a centralized source of health oriented information for both consumers and medical professionals 
patients whose physicians are linked to the portal are able to request appointments  send appointment changes or cancellations  receive test results on line  request prescription refills  view and or pay their statements  and communicate with their physicians  all in a secure  on line environment 
our nextgen suite of information systems are or can be linked to nextmd 
com  integrating a number of these features with physicians existing systems 
our qsi division also provides a web based application called qsinet which allows clients to access information from their practice management system via the internet 
this application also enables providers to offer their patients convenient services such as on line appointment scheduling and electronic bill payment through the client s website  and posts this data directly to the client s existing practice management system 
sales and marketing we sell and market our products nationwide primarily through a direct sales force 
the efforts of the direct sales force are augmented by a small number of reseller relationships established by us 
software license sales to resellers represented less than of total revenue for the years ended march  and our direct sales force typically makes presentations to potential clients by demonstrating the system and our capabilities on the prospective client s premises 
sales efforts aimed at smaller practices are primarily performed remotely via telephone or internet based presentations 
our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means  including referrals from existing clients  industry consultants  contacts at professional society meetings  trade shows and seminars  trade journal advertising  direct mail advertising  and telemarketing 
our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty four months from initial contact to contract execution 
software licenses are normally delivered to a customer almost immediately upon receipt of an order 
implementation and training services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable 
as part of the fees paid by our clients  we receive up front licensing fees 
clients have the option to purchase maintenance services which  if purchased  are invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis 
several clients have purchased our practice management software and  in turn  are providing either time share or billing services to single and group practice practitioners 
under the time share or billing service agreements  the client provides the use of our software for a fee to one or more practitioners 
although we typically do not receive a fee directly from the distributor s customers  implementation of such arrangements has  from time to time  resulted in the purchase of additional software capacity by the distributor  as well as new software purchases made by the distributor s customers should such customers decide to perform the practice management functions in house 
we continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on medical and dental practices  networks of such practices including mso s and pho s  professional schools  community health centers and other ambulatory care settings 
mso s  pho s and similar networks to which we have sold systems provide use of our software to those group and single physician practices associated with the organization or hospital on either a service basis or by directing us to contract with those practices for the sale of stand alone systems 
we have also entered into marketing assistance agreements with certain of our clients pursuant to which the clients allow us to demonstrate to potential clients the use of systems on the existing clients premises 
from time to time we assist prospective clients in identifying third party sources for financing the purchase of our systems 
the financing is typically obtained by the client directly from institutional lenders and typically takes the form of a loan from the institution secured by the system to be purchased or a leasing arrangement 
we do not guarantee the financing nor retain any continuing interest in the transaction 
we have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would have a material adverse effect on us 
no client accounted for ten percent or more of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march    or customer service and support we believe our success is attributable in part to our customer service and support departments 
we offer support to our clients seven days a week  hours a day 
our client support staff is comprised of specialists who are knowledgeable in the areas of software and hardware as well as in the day to day operations of a practice 
system support activities range from correcting minor procedural problems in the client s system to performing complex database reconstructions or software updates 
we utilize automated online support systems which assist clients in resolving minor problems and facilitate automated electronic retrieval of problems and symptoms following a client s call to the automated support system 
additionally  our online support systems maintain call records  available at both the client s facility and our offices 
we offer our clients support services for most system components  including hardware and software  for a fixed monthly or quarterly fee 
customers also receive access to future unspecified versions of the software  on a when and if available basis  as part of support services 
we also subcontract  in certain instances  with third party vendors to perform specific hardware maintenance tasks 
implementation and training we offer full service implementation and training services 
when a client signs a contract for the purchase of a system that includes implementation and training services  a client manager implementation specialist trained in medical and or dental group practice procedures is assigned to assist the client in the installation of the system and the training of appropriate practice staff 
implementation services include loading the software  training customer personnel  data conversion  running test data  and assisting in the development and documentation of procedures 
implementation and training services are provided by our employees as well as certified third parties and certain resellers 
training may include a combination of computer assisted instruction cai for certain of our products  remote training techniques and training classes conducted at the client s or our office s 
cai consists of workbooks  computer interaction and self paced instruction 
cai is also offered to clients  for an additional charge  after the initial training program is completed for the purpose of training new and additional employees 
remote training allows a trainer at our offices to train one or more people at a client site via telephone and computer connection  thus allowing an interactive and client specific mode of training without the expense and time required for travel 
in addition  our on line help and other documentation features facilitate client training as well as ongoing support 
during fiscal year  we introduced nextgen e learning  an on line learning subscription service which allows end users to train on the software on the internet 
e learning allows end users to self manage their own learning with their personal learning path 
the service allows users to track the status of courses taken 
also in fiscal year  we opened a nextgen training facility adjacent to our corporate offices in irvine  california and initiated expansion of training facilities in horsham  pennsylvania and atlanta  georgia 
competition the markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive 
the industry is highly fragmented and includes numerous competitors  none of which we believe dominates these markets 
the electronic patient records and connectivity markets  in particular  are subject to rapid changes in technology  and we expect that competition in these market segments will increase as new competitors enter the market 
we believe our principal competitive advantages are the features and capabilities of our products and services  our high level of customer support  and our extensive experience in the industry 
production enhancement and development the healthcare information management and computer software and hardware industries are characterized by rapid technological change requiring us to engage in continuing investments to update  enhance  and improve our systems 
during fiscal years   and  we expended approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on research and development activities  including capitalized software amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  a portion of our product enhancements have resulted from software development work performed under contracts with our clients 
employees as of june   we employed persons  of which were full time employees 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales  marketing and technical personnel as well as other employees 
item a 
risk factors the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are described below 
however  additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations will likely suffer 
any of these or other factors could harm our business and future results of operations and may cause you to lose all or part of your investment 
we face significant  evolving competition 
the markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive and we face significant competition from a number of different sources 
several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition as well as substantially greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources than we do 
there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among a number of our competitors in recent months 
transaction induced pressures  or other related factors may result in price erosion or other negative market dynamics that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and price of our stock 
we compete in all of our markets with other major healthcare related companies  information management companies  systems integrators  and other software developers 
competitive pressures and other factors  such as new product introductions by ourselves or our competitors  may result in price or market share erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  there can be no assurance that our applications will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other available software products 
our inability to make initial sales of our systems to newly formed groups and or healthcare providers that are replacing or substantially modifying their healthcare information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if new systems sales do not materialize  our near term and longer term revenue will be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated and may do so in the future 
our revenue may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period  as a result of a number of factors including  without limitation the size and timing of orders from clients  the specific mix of software  hardware  and services in client orders  the length of sales cycles and installation processes  the ability of our clients to obtain financing for the purchase of our products  changes in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors  the timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors  changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and or established by the financial accounting standards board or other rule making bodies  the availability and cost of system components  the financial stability of clients  market acceptance of new products  applications and product enhancements  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products  applications and product enhancements  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  deferrals of client orders in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements  or public private sector initiatives  execution of or changes to our strategy  personnel changes  and general market economic factors 
our software products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly  we have historically operated with a minimal backlog of license fees 
as a result  revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
furthermore  our systems can be relatively large and expensive and individual systems sales can represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such sale can have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly revenue and profitability 
clients often defer systems purchases until our quarter end  so quarterly results generally cannot be predicted and frequently are not known until the quarter has concluded 
our sales are dependent upon clients initial decisions to replace or substantially modify their existing information systems  and subsequently a decision as to which products and services to purchase 
these are major decisions for healthcare providers  and accordingly  the sales cycle for our systems can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty four months from initial contact to contract execution shipment 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of systems sales  implementations  and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that interim period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
further  our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period 
we currently recognize revenue pursuant to statement of position sop  as modified by sop and staff accounting bulletin sab sab summarizes the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
there can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of these pronouncements will not further modify our revenue recognition policies  or that such modifications would not have a material adverse effect on the operating results reported in any particular quarter or year 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
the price of our shares and the trading volume of our shares have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile 
volatility may be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  rumors about our performance  software solutions  or merger and acquisition activity  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  health care reform measures  client relationship developments  purchases or sales of company stock  changes occurring in the markets in general  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the market for software  healthcare and high technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
two of our directors are significant shareholders  which makes it possible for them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders 
two of our directors and principal shareholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at march  the company s bylaws permit its shareholders to cumulate their votes  the effect of which is to provide shareholders with sufficiently large concentrations of company shares the opportunity to assure themselves one or more seats on the company s board 
the amounts required to assure a board position can vary based upon the number of shares outstanding  the number of shares voting  the number of directors to be elected  the number of broker non votes  and the number of shares held by the shareholder exercising cumulative voting rights 
in the event that cumulative voting is invoked  it is likely that the two of our directors holding an aggregate of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock at march  will each have sufficient votes to assure themselves of one or more seats on our board 
with or without cumulative voting  these shareholders will have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the election of our directors and other corporate actions 
in addition  such influence by one or both of these affiliates could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting to purchase us  take us over  and or reducing the market price offered for our common stock in such an event 
we face risks related to litigation advanced by a director and shareholder of the company 
in october  a lawsuit was filed against us and six of our eight directors those elected by the shareholders  but not nominated by mr 
ahmed hussein by one of our directors  mr 
ahmed hussein 
the complaint alleges that in connection with our annual shareholders meeting  the certified results from the independent inspector of election included certain proxies that should not have been included in the final vote tabulation 
the independent inspector of election certified the election of the eight directors presently serving on the board after hearing mr 
hussein s claim concerning this matter 
on march  the california superior court issued a ruling in favor of the company  upholding the validity of the previously announced election results and finding that mr 
hussein was not entitled to equitable relief 
mr 
hussein has filed a notice of appeal with respect to the court s decision 
as a result of such litigation  the company s operating results and share price may be negatively impacted due to the negative publicity  additional expenses incurred  management distraction  and or other factors 
in addition  litigation of this nature may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 
it is also possible that mr 
hussein will launch further proxy contests or legal action in opposition to the company s board nominees at one or more future shareholder meetings with potential negative effects similar to those discussed above 
we are dependent on our principal products and our new product development 
we currently derive substantially all of our net revenue from sales of our healthcare information systems and related services 
we believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our systems has been our ability to meet the needs of users of healthcare information systems 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients through the timely development and successful introduction and implementation of new and enhanced versions of our systems and other complementary products 
we have historically expended a significant percentage of our net revenue on product development and believe that significant continuing product development efforts will be required to sustain our growth 
continued investment in our sales staff and our client implementation and support staffs will also be required to support future growth 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product development efforts  that the market will continue to accept our existing products  or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner  meet the requirements of healthcare providers  or achieve market acceptance 
if new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
at certain times in the past  we have also experienced delays in purchases of our products by clients anticipating our launch of new products 
there can be no assurance that material order deferrals in anticipation of new product introductions from ourselves or other entities will not occur 
if the emerging technologies and platforms of microsoft and others upon which we build our products do not gain broad market acceptance  or if we fail to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and services compatible with such emerging technologies  we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 
our software products are built and depend upon several underlying and evolving relational database management system platforms such as those developed by microsoft 
to date  the standards and technologies upon which we have chosen to develop our products have proven to have gained industry acceptance 
however  the market for our software products is subject to ongoing rapid technological developments  quickly evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements  and there may be existing or future technologies and platforms that achieve industry standard status  which are not compatible with our products 
we face the possibility of subscription pricing 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from traditional software license  maintenance and service fees  as well as the resale of computer hardware 
today  customers pay an initial license fee for the use of our products  in addition to a periodic maintenance fee 
if the marketplace increasingly demands subscription pricing  we may be forced to adjust our sales  marketing and pricing strategies accordingly  by offering a higher percentage of our products and services through these means 
shifting to a significantly greater degree of subscription pricing could materially adversely impact our financial condition  cash flows and quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations  as our revenue would initially decrease substantially 
there can be no assurance that the marketplace will not increasingly embrace subscription pricing 
the industry in which we operate is subject to significant technological change 
the software market generally is characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards 
new product development depends upon significant research and development expenditures which depend ultimately upon sales growth 
any material shortfall in revenue or research funding could impair our ability to respond to technological advances or opportunities in the marketplace and to remain competitive 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in response to increasing market demand  we are currently developing new generations of certain of our software products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these new software products or that these products will operate successfully  or that any such development  even if successful  will be completed concurrently with or prior to introduction of competing products 
any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete 
we face the possibility of claims based upon our web site 
we could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our web site by us or third parties  including content providers or users 
we could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our web site or third party web sites linked from our web site or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms  bulletin boards or on web sites created by professionals using our applications 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
we face the possibility of claims from activities of strategic partners 
we rely on third parties to provide services that impact our business 
for example  we use national clearinghouses in the processing of some insurance claims and we outsource some of our hardware maintenance services and the printing and delivery of patient statements for our customers 
we also have relationships with certain third parties where these third parties serve as sales channels through which we generate a portion of our revenue 
due to these third party relationships  we could be subject to claims as a result of the activities  products  or services of these third party service providers even though we were not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  defending and investigating these claims could be expensive and time consuming  divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
we may engage in future acquisitions  which may be expensive and time consuming and from which we may not realize anticipated benefits 
we may acquire additional businesses  technologies and products if we determine that these additional businesses  technologies and products are likely to serve our strategic goals 
we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions 
the specific risks we may encounter in these types of transactions include but are not limited to the following potentially dilutive issuances of our securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions  use of cash as acquisition currency may adversely impact interest or investment income  thereby potentially negatively affecting our earnings and or earnings per share  difficulty in effectively integrating any acquired technologies or software products into our current products and technologies  difficulty in predicting and responding to issues related to product transition such as development  distribution and customer support  the possible adverse impact of such acquisitions on existing relationships with third party partners and suppliers of technologies and services  the possibility that staff or customers of the acquired company might not accept new ownership and may transition to different technologies or attempt to renegotiate contract terms or relationships  including maintenance or support agreements  the possibility that the due diligence process in any such acquisition may not completely identify material issues associated with product quality  product architecture  product development  intellectual property issues  key personnel issues or legal and financial contingencies  including any deficiencies in internal controls and procedures and the costs associated with remedying such deficiencies  difficulty in integrating acquired operations due to geographical distance  and language and cultural differences  and the possibility that acquired assets become impaired  requiring the company to take a charge to earnings which could be significant 
a failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technology for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
we face the risks and uncertainties that are associated with litigation against us 
we face the risks associated with litigation concerning the operation of our business 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation may have an adverse impact on our business 
in particular  such litigation could impair our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
defending such litigation may result in a diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
such litigation may also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirers from bidding for us or reducing the consideration such acquirers would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage  that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
we rely heavily on our proprietary technology 
we are heavily dependent on the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property and we rely largely on license agreements  confidentiality procedures  and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property 
our software is not patented and existing copyright laws offer only limited practical protection 
there can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or superior to ours 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the united states 
we do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement or other financial arrangement with the party asserting the claim 
responding to and defending any such claims may distract the attention of company management and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  claims may be brought against third parties from which we purchase software  and such claims could adversely affect our ability to access third party software for our systems 
we are dependent on our license rights from third parties 
we depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products from third party vendors 
most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time 
we may not be able to continue using the technology made available to us under these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as a result  we may have to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments until we can obtain equivalent technology 
most of our third party licenses are non exclusive 
our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts  we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products 
we face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches  and viruses 
in the course of our business operations  we compile and transmit confidential information  including patient health information  in our processing centers and other facilities 
a breach of security in any of these facilities could damage our reputation and result in damages being assessed against us 
in addition  the other systems with which we may interface  such as the internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches  viruses  programming errors  or similar disruptive problems 
the effect of these security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services 
accordingly  we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures  although no assurance can be given that they will be entirely free from potential breach 
maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future 
the success of our strategy to offer our edi services and internet solutions depends on the confidence of our customers in our ability to securely transmit confidential information 
our edi services and internet solutions rely on encryption  authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information 
we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our customers 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our  or our customers operations 
in addition  our edi and internet solutions may be vulnerable to viruses  physical or electronic break ins  and similar disruptions 
any failure to provide secure infrastructure and or electronic communication services could result in a lack of trust by our customers causing them to seek out other vendors  and or  damage our reputation in the market making it difficult to obtain new customers 
we are subject to the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure which is not within our control 
we deliver internet based services and  accordingly  we are dependent on the maintenance of the internet by third parties 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it and our performance may decrease if the internet continues to experience it s historic trend of expanding usage 
as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  the internet has experienced a variety of performance problems which may continue into the foreseeable future 
such internet related problems may diminish internet usage and availability of the internet to us for transmittal of our internet based services 
in addition  difficulties  outages  and delays by internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators may obstruct or diminish access to our web site by our customers resulting in a loss of potential or existing users of our services 
our failure to manage growth could harm us 
we have in the past experienced periods of growth which have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our non cash resources 
we also anticipate expanding our overall software development  marketing  sales  client management and training capacity 
in the event we are unable to identify  hire  train and retain qualified individuals in such capacities within a reasonable timeframe  such failure could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our ability to manage future increases  if any  in the scope of our operations or personnel will depend on significant expansion of our research and development  marketing and sales  management  and administrative and financial capabilities 
the failure of our management to effectively manage expansion in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are dependent upon our key personnel 
if such personnel were to leave unexpectedly  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  many of whom have been with us for a significant period of time 
these personnel have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business 
we maintain key man life insurance on only one of our employees 
because we have a relatively small number of employees when compared to other leading companies in our industry  our dependence on maintaining our relationships with key employees is particularly significant 
we are also dependent on our ability to attract high quality personnel  particularly in the areas of sales and applications development 
the industry in which we operate is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
there can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us 
loss of services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may need to grant additional equity incentives to key employees and provide other forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel 
failure to provide such types of incentive compensation could jeopardize our recruitment and retention capabilities 
our products may be subject to product liability legal claims 
certain of our products provide applications that relate to patient clinical information 
any failure by our products to provide accurate and timely information could result in claims against us 
in addition  a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly  including through licensed practitioners  or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our web sites  exposes us to assertions of malpractice  other personal injury liability  or other liability for wrongful delivery handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information 
we maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products as well as liability limitation language in our end user license agreements  but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources 
certain healthcare professionals who use our internet based products will directly enter health information about their patients including information that constitutes a record under applicable law that we may store on our computer systems 
numerous federal and state laws and regulations  the common law  and contractual obligations  govern collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including state and federal privacy and confidentiality laws  our contracts with customers and partners  state laws regulating healthcare professionals  medicaid laws  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and related rules proposed by the health care financing administration  and health care financing administration standards for internet transmission of health data 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of establishes elements including  but not limited to  federal privacy and security standards for the use and protection of protected health information 
any failure by us or by our personnel or partners to comply with applicable requirements may result in a material liability to us 
although we have systems and policies in place for safeguarding protected health information from unauthorized disclosure  these systems and policies may not preclude claims against us for alleged violations of applicable requirements 
also  third party sites and or links that consumers may access through our web sites may not maintain adequate systems to safeguard this information  or may circumvent systems and policies we have put in place 
in addition  future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our policies  procedures  or systems 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to product liability claims  that such claims will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage  that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
such product liability claims could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to the effect of payor and provider conduct which we cannot control 
we offer certain electronic claims submission products and services as part of our product line 
while we have implemented certain product features designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims submissions  these features may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payors 
should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payors  we may be subject to liability claims 
electronic data transmission services are offered by certain payors to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payor 
this process reduces revenue to third party edi service providers such as us 
accordingly  we are unable to insure that we will continue to generate revenue at or in excess of prior levels for such services 
a significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payers could have a material adverse effect on our transaction volume and financial results 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our exiting links to payors or develop new connections on terms that are economically satisfactory to us  if at all 
there is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry in which we operate and we are subject to the possibility of changing government regulation 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
in the past  various legislators have announced that they intend to examine proposals to reform certain aspects of the us healthcare system including proposals which may change governmental involvement in healthcare and reimbursement rates  and otherwise alter the operating environment for us and our clients 
healthcare providers may react to these proposals  and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals  by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our systems and related services 
cost containment measures instituted by healthcare providers as a result of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction in the allocation of capital funds 
such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our systems and related services 
on the other hand  changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the hipaa regulations  as adopted by the department of health and human services  established  among other things a national standard for electronic transactions and code sets to be used in those transactions involving certain common health care transactions  privacy regulations to protect the privacy of plan participants and patients medical records  and security regulations designed to establish security controls and measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal identifiable health information when it is electronically stored  maintained or transmitted even if only internally transmitted within a medical practice 
as these regulations mature and become better defined  we anticipate that these regulations will continue to directly affect certain of our products and services  but we cannot fully predict the impact at this time 
we have taken steps to modify our products  services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our and our client s compliance with the final regulations  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner 
achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract management s attention and divert other company resources  and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  development of related federal and state regulations and policies regarding the confidentiality of health information or other matters may or may not supercede hipaa and have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business 
in addition  our software may potentially be subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda as a medical device 
such regulation could require the registration of the applicable manufacturing facility and software and hardware products  application of detailed record keeping and manufacturing standards  and fda approval or clearance prior to marketing 
an approval or clearance requirement could create delays in marketing  and the fda could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these applications  the result of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to other e commerce regulations 
we may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the internet 
on an increasingly frequent basis  federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to internet commerce and communications 
areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy  pricing  content  taxation  copyright protection  distribution  and quality of products and services 
to the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations  the sale of our products and services could be harmed 
we are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance 
based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance  principles or concepts issued by  among other authorities  the american institute of certified public accountants  the financial accounting standards board  and the united states securities and exchange commission  management believes our current sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition and or other accounting policies and practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  revenue and results of operations 
our per share price may be adversely effected if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified by ourselves or our independent auditors 
any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls as part of the ongoing evaluation being undertaken by us and our independent public accountants pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on the price at which our stock trades 
no evaluation process can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect and correct all failures within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported 
the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments 
in addition  if we continue to expand  either organic growth or through acquisitions or both  the challenges involved in implementing appropriate controls will increase and may require that we evolve some or all of our internal control processes 
it is also possible that the overall scope of section of the sarbanes oxley act of may be revised in the future  thereby causing our auditors and ourselves to review  revise or reevaluate our internal control processes which may result in the expenditure of additional human and financial resources 
our earnings will be affected beginning fiscal year when we begin recognizing employee stock option expense  pursuant to recently issued accounting standards 
stock options have from time to time been an important component of the compensation packages for many of our mid and senior level employees 
we currently do not deduct the expense of employee stock option grants from our income 
however  beginning with the quarter ending june  and beyond  we will begin recognizing employee stock option expense for remaining unvested stock options and any future stock option grants  resulting in additional pre tax compensation expense 
option expensing will have a negative impact upon our earnings per share and may have a negative impact on the price of our stock 
continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
the last several years have been periodically marked by concerns including but not limited to inflation  decreased consumer confidence  the lingering effects of international conflicts  energy costs and terrorist and military activities 
these conditions can make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and ourselves to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause constrained spending on our products and services  and or delay and lengthen sales cycles 
our future policy concerning the payment of dividends is uncertain 
while we paid special cash dividends in march and  we have not historically paid dividends  cash or otherwise  and there can be no assurance that we will pay another dividend in the future 
unfulfilled expectations to the contrary could have a material negative impact upon the price of our stock 
our future policy concerning stock splits is uncertain 
while we effected a split of our stock in march and a second stock split in march  there can be no assurance that another stock split will occur in the future 
unfulfilled expectations to the contrary could have a material negative impact upon the price of our stock 
item b

we believe that suitable additional or substitute space is available  if needed  at commercially reasonable rates 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
while the ultimate resolution of these matters  has yet to be determined  we do not believe that their outcome will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

many other economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors could impact our ability to achieve our goals  and interested persons are urged to review the risks described in item a

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in our entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
historical results of operations  percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  and intangible assets  for reasonableness 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software costs and tax credits are among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that significant accounting policies  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we currently recognize revenue pursuant to sop  as amended by sop we generate revenue from the sale of licensing rights to use our software products sold directly to end users and value added resellers vars 
we also generate revenue from sales of hardware and third party software  and implementation  training  software customization  edi  post contract support maintenance and other services performed for customers who license our products 
a typical system contract contains multiple elements of the above items 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately using a rolling average of stand alone transactions or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed at the end of each quarter 
when evidence of fair value exists for the delivered and undelivered elements of a transaction  then discounts for individual elements are aggregated and the total discount is allocated to the individual elements in proportion to the elements fair value relative to the total contract fair value 
when evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements only  the residual method  provided for under sop  is used 
under the residual method  the company defers revenue related to the undelivered elements in a system sale based on vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements  and allocates the remainder of the contract price net of all discounts to revenue recognized from the delivered elements 
undelivered elements of a system sale may include implementation and training services  hardware and third party software  maintenance  future purchase discounts  or other services 
if vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist  all revenue is deferred until vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered 
we bill for the entire contract amount upon contract execution 
amounts billed in excess of the amounts contractually due are recorded in accounts receivable as advance billings 
amounts are contractually due when services are performed or in accordance with contractually specified payment dates 
provided the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable  revenue from licensing rights and sales of hardware and third party software is generally recognized upon shipment and transfer of title 
revenue from implementation and training services is recognized as the corresponding services are performed 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
pursuant to sop  the company uses the percentage of completion method provided all of the following conditions exist the contract includes provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by the parties  the consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  the company can be expected to perform its contractual obligations  and reliable estimates of progress towards completion can be made 
we measure completion using labor input hours 
costs of providing services  including services accounted for in accordance with sop  are expensed as incurred 
if a situation occurs in which a contract is so short term that the financial statements would not vary materially from using the percentage of completion method or in which we are unable to make reliable estimates of progress of completion of the contract  the completed contract method is utilized 
from time to time  we offer future purchase discounts on our products and services as part of our sales arrangements 
pursuant to aicpa tpa  discounts which are incremental to the range of discounts reflected in the pricing of the other elements of the arrangement  which are incremental to the range of discounts typically given in comparable transactions  and which are significant  are treated as an additional element of the contract to be deferred 
amounts deferred related to future purchase options are not recognized until either the customer exercises the discount offer or the offer expires 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
reserves for potential credit losses are determined by establishing both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are based on management s estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts 
general reserves are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
software development costs 
development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established with the completion of a working model of the enhancement or product  any additional development costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product  which is generally three years 
we perform an annual review of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
research and development tax credits 
during the year ended march   the state of california completed an audit of the company s tax returns and did not materially change credits related to research and development 
based on the results of that audit as well the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain amended returns  the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was reduced by the million in tax credits which had not been recognized as of march during the year ended march   the company recognized approximately million in credits related to research and development

overview of company results we have experienced significant growth in our total revenue as a result of revenue growth in our nextgen division 
our total company revenue grew on a consolidated basis during the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus consolidated income from operations grew in the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus this performance was driven by the results in our nextgen division 
we have benefited and hope to continue to benefit from the increased demands on healthcare providers for greater efficiency and lower costs  as well as increased adoption rates of technology in the healthcare arena 
nextgen division our nextgen division has experienced significant growth in revenue and operating income 
divisional revenue grew in the twelve months ended march  versus and in the twelve months ended march  versus while divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses grew in the twelve months end march  and in the twelve months ended march  during the twelve months ended march   we added staffing resources to departments including sales  marketing  support  implementation  software development  and administration and intend to continue to do so  as business conditions and the hiring environment allows  in fiscal year during the twelve months ended march   we executed our first significant sale to siemens medical solutions totaling million 
we recognized million related to this sale during the quarter ended march  the remaining balance will be recognized in future periods 
our goals include continuing to further enhance our existing products  developing new products for targeted markets  continuing to add new customers  selling additional software and services to existing customers and expanding penetration of connectivity services to new and existing customers 
qsi division our qsi division experienced a revenue increase of in the twelve months ended march  versus and a decline of in the twelve months ended march  versus the division experienced a decrease in operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses in the twelve months ended march  and decrease in the twelve months ended march  our goals for the qsi division include maximizing revenue and profit performance given the constraints present in this division s target market

in comparison  we earned million or per share on a basic and on a fully diluted basis in the year ended march  the increase in net income for the year ended march   was achieved primarily through the following a increase in consolidated revenue  a increase in nextgen division revenue which accounted for of consolidated revenue  and an increase in our consolidated gross profit margin from to 
revenue 
revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  nextgen division revenue increased from million to approximately million in the period  while qsi division revenue increased slightly by during the period from million to million 
we divide revenue into three categories  system sales  maintenance and other services and electronic data interchange edi services 
revenue in the system sales category includes software license fees  third party hardware and software  and implementation and training services related to purchase of the company s software systems 
system sales 
company wide sales of systems for the twelve months ended march  increased to million from million in the prior year 
our increase in revenue from sales of systems was principally the result of a increase in category revenue at our nextgen division whose sales in this category grew from million during the year ended march  to million during the year ended march  this increase was driven primarily by higher sales of nextgen emr and nextgen epm software to both new and existing clients  as well as an increase in the delivery of related implementation services offset by a decline in the sale of related hardware  third party software and supplies 
systems sales revenue in the qsi division increased to approximately million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  the following table breaks down our reported system sales into software  hardware  third party software  supplies  and implementation and training services components by division in thousands software hardware  third party software and supplies implementation and training services total system sales twelve months ended march  qsi division nextgen division consolidated twelve months ended march  qsi division nextgen division consolidated nextgen division software revenue increased between the twelve months ended march  and the twelve months ended march  the division s software revenue accounted for of divisional system sales revenue during the twelve months ended march   an increase from in the prior year period 
software revenue from vars totaled approximately million during the year ended march  compared to million in the year ago period 
the increase in var revenue was impacted in part by revenue from sales to siemens medical solutions 
the increase in software s share of systems sales was not the result of any new trend or change in emphasis on our part relative to software sales 
software license revenue growth continues to be an area of primary emphasis for the nextgen division and management was pleased with the division s performance in this area 
during the twelve months ended march   of nextgen s system sales revenue was represented by hardware and third party software compared to in the same prior year period 
we have noted that the last several quarters and years results have generally included a relatively lower amount of hardware and third party software compared to prior year periods 
however  this decrease is not the result of any change in emphasis on our part 
the number of customers who purchase hardware and third party software and the dollar amount of hardware and third party software revenue fluctuates each year depending on the needs of customers 
the inclusion of hardware and third party software in the division s sales arrangements is typically at the request of the customer and is not a priority focus for us 
implementation and training revenue at the nextgen division increased in the twelve months ended march  compared to the twelve months ended march  the growth in implementation and training revenue is the result of increases in the amount of implementation and training services rendered to our customers 
implementation and training revenue at the nextgen division slightly decreased its share of divisional system sales revenue to in the twelve months ended march  from in the twelve months ended march  the amount of implementation and training services revenue and the corresponding rate of growth compared to a prior period in any given year is dependent on several factors including timing of customer implementations  the availability of qualified staff  and the mix of services being rendered 
the number of implementation and training staff increased during the twelve months ended march  versus march  in order to accommodate the increased amount of implementation services sold in conjunction with increased software sales 
in order to achieve continued increased revenue in this area  additional staffing increases are anticipated  though actual future increases in revenue and staff will depend upon the availability of qualified staff  business mix and conditions  and our ability to retain current staff members 
the nextgen division s growth has come in part from investments in sales and marketing activities  including hiring additional sales representatives  trade show attendance  and advertising expenditures 
we have also benefited from winning numerous industry awards for the nextgen division s flagship nextgen emr and nextgen epm software products in fiscal years and  as well as in prior years  and the apparent increasing acceptance of electronic medical records technology in the healthcare industry 
for the qsi division  total system sales increased by approximately million in the twelve months ended march  compared to the twelve months ended march  due primarily to increases in all three categories 
we do not presently foresee any material changes in the business environment for the division with respect to the constrained environment that has been in place for the past several years 
edi  maintenance and other 
company wide revenue from maintenance  edi  and other services grew to million from million 
the increase in this category resulted principally from an increase in maintenance  edi and other revenue generated from the nextgen division s client base 
total nextgen division maintenance revenue for the year ended march  grew to million from million in the year ago period  while edi revenue grew to million compared to million in the year ago period 
other revenue for the nextgen division  which consists primarily of third party license renewals and time and materials billings grew to million compared to million a year ago 
qsi division maintenance revenue declined from million to million in the same period while divisional edi revenue declined by approximately from million to million 
other revenue for the qsi division grew to million compared to million a year ago

cost of revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march   while the cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue declined to from during the same period 
our consolidated gross profit is impacted by the level of hardware content included in system sales  the percentage of edi revenue in our overall sales mix  and certain headcount expenses directly related to the cost of delivering our products and services 
consolidated gross profit is also impacted by the higher margin revenues of the nextgen division which increased its share of total company revenue to from in the prior year 
the following table details revenue and cost of revenue on a consolidated and divisional basis for the twelve month periods ended march  and in thousands  except percentages year ended march  consolidated revenue cost of revenue gross profit nextgen division revenue cost of revenue gross profit qsi division revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross profit margins at the nextgen division for the year ended march  increased to from primarily due to a decrease in the proportionate level of hardware and third party software content included in revenue as well as a slight decrease in the relative level of applicable headcount expense associated with delivering our products and services 
the qsi division s gross profit margin remained consistent at approximately in the years ended march  and for the qsi division higher hardware and third party software costs offset a decrease in the relative level of applicable headcount expense associated with delivering our products and services 
the following table details the individual components of cost of revenue and gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for our company and our two divisions hardware  third party software payroll and related benefits outside services  amortization of software development costs and other total cost of revenue gross profit twelve months ended march  qsi division nextgen division consolidated twelve months ended march  qsi division nextgen division consolidated during the twelve months ended march   hardware and third party software constituted a smaller portion of consolidated revenue compared to the same prior year period  driven principally both by the composition of nextgen division revenue and nextgen division revenue increasing its share of total company revenue 
this year over year reduction was not the result of any identifiable trend or change in emphasis on our part 
the number of customers who purchase hardware and third party software and the dollar amount of hardware and third party software purchased fluctuates each quarter depending on the needs of the customers and is not a priority focus for us 
our payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering our products and services decreased to of consolidated revenue compared to during the prior twelve months ended march  the absolute level of consolidated payroll and benefit expenses grew approximately million primarily due to additions to related headcount  payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering products and services in the nextgen division 
payroll and benefits expense associated with delivering products and services in the qsi division declined on a percentage of revenue basis 
we anticipate continued additions to headcount in the nextgen division in areas related to delivering products and services in future periods  but due to the uncertainties in the timing of our sales arrangements  our sales mix  the acquisition and training of qualified personnel  and other issues  we cannot accurately predict if related headcount expense as a percentage of revenue will increase or decrease in the future 
we do not currently intend to make any significant changes to related headcount at the qsi division 
should the nextgen division continue to represent an increasing share of our revenue and should the nextgen division continue to carry higher gross margins than the qsi division  our consolidated gross margin percentages should increase to more closely match those of the nextgen division 
as a result of the foregoing events and activities  our gross profit for the company and the nextgen division increased for the twelve month period ending march  versus the prior year period and the qsi division remained fairly consistent for the twelve month period ending march  versus the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from increases of million in selling and administrative salaries and related benefits expenses in the nextgen division  million in commission expense in the nextgen division  million in travel expense in the nextgen division  million in other general and administrative expenses primarily in the nextgen division and million in increased corporate related expenses 
approximately million of the increase in year over year corporate related expenses was salaries and related benefits 
expenses associated with the annual shareholders meeting  the contested director election  and subsequent litigation initiated by ahmed hussein also contributed to the increase in corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to in the fiscal year ended march  from in the fiscal period ended march  due to selling  general and administrative expenses growing at a faster rate than revenue 
we anticipate increased expenditures for trade shows  advertising and the employment of additional sales representatives primarily at the nextgen division 
we also anticipate increased expenditures at the corporate level related to headcount additions  compensation and professional service fees 
while we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute basis  we cannot accurately predict the impact these additional expenditures will have on selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to increased investment in the nextgen product line 
research and development costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased to from primarily due to revenue growing at a faster rate than the increase in research and development spending 
research and development costs are expected to continue at or above current levels 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended march  increased to approximately million compared with million in the year ended march  the increase was primarily due to the effect of an increase in short term interest rates versus the prior year period as well as comparatively higher amounts available for investment during the fiscal period ended march  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company paid a dividend of approximately million  which reduced the amount of funds available for investment during this period 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ago period 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  differs from the combined statutory rates primarily due to the impact of varying state income tax rates and the impact of research and development tax credits 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  differs from the combined statutory rates primarily due to the impact of varying state income tax rates  research and development tax credits and the qualified production activities deduction

during the year ended march   the state of california completed an audit of the company s tax returns and did not materially change credits related to research and development 
based on the results of that audit as well the expiration of the statue of limitations on certain amended returns  the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was reduced by the million in tax credits which had not been previously recognized

maintenance and edi revenue are the principle sources of revenue in this category 
system sales

cash provided by operations has historically been our primary source of cash and has primarily been driven by our net income and secondarily by non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization of capitalized software  provisions for bad debts and inventory obsolescence  and stock option expenses 
the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows for the year ended march   and year ended march  in thousands net income non cash expenses tax benefit from exercise of stock options change in deferred revenue change in accounts receivable change in assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities net income as referenced in the above table  net income makes up the majority of our cash generated from operations for the year ended march   and our nextgen division s contribution to net income has increased each year due to that division s operating income increasing more quickly than the company as a whole 
non cash expenses non cash expenses include depreciation  amortization of capitalized software  provisions for bad debts and inventory obsolescence  and stock option expenses 
total non cash expenses decreased by approximately million between the years ended march  versus the change is primarily related to million decrease in deferred income taxes offset by increases in the amortization of capitalized software  depreciation and provision for bad debts 
tax benefits from stock options the value of stock options exercised by employees grew in the year ended march  resulting in an increase of approximately million dollars of tax benefit in the period ending march  deferred revenue cash from operations benefited significantly from increases in deferred revenue primarily due to an increase in the volume of implementation and maintenance services invoiced by the nextgen division which had not yet been rendered or recognized as revenue 
this benefit is offset by the increase in unpaid deferred revenue 
deferred revenue grew by approximately million for the year ended march  versus growth of million in the year ago period  resulting in increases to cash provided by operating activities for the respective periods 
accounts receivable accounts receivable grew by approximately million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable in the periods is due to the following factors nextgen division revenue grew  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  the nextgen division constituted a larger percentage of our receivables at march  compared to march  turnover of accounts receivable in the nextgen division is slower than the qsi division due to the fact that the majority of the qsi division s revenue is coming from maintenance and edi services which typically have shorter payment terms than systems sales related revenue which historically have accounted for a major portion of nextgen division sales  and we experienced an increase in the volume of undelivered services billed in advance by the nextgen division which were unpaid as of the end of each period and included in accounts receivable 
this resulted in an increase in both deferred revenue and accounts receivable of approximately million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the turnover of accounts receivable measured in terms of days sales outstanding dso decreased from days to days during the year ended march  primarily due to improved turnover of accounts receivable and revenue growing at a faster rate than the accounts receivable balance and the million transaction with siemens medical solutions that was paid upfront during fiscal year if amounts included in both accounts receivable and deferred revenue were netted  the company s turnover of accounts received expressed as days sales outstanding would be days as of march  and days as of march  provided turnover of accounts receivable  deferred revenue  and profitability remain consistent with the year ended march   we anticipate being able to continue to generate cash from operations during fiscal primarily from the net income of the company 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million and consisted of additions to equipment and improvements and capitalized software 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was million and consisted of a dividend paid to shareholders of million offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we recorded a reduction in income tax liability of million related to tax deductions received from employee stock option exercises 
the benefit was recorded as additional paid in capital 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we intend to expend some of these funds for the development of products complementary to our existing product line as well as new versions of certain of our products 
these developments are intended to take advantage of more powerful technologies and to increase the integration of our products 
we have no additional significant current capital commitments

sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

 statement of cash flows sfas 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values and the pro forma disclosure alternative is no longer allowable under statement r 
subsequently  in april  the securities and exchange commission sec changed the effective date from the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  to the first annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas r will be applicable to the company beginning april   and the company intends to adopt the standard using the modified prospective method 
the modified prospective method requires compensation costs to be recognized  beginning with the effective date of adoption  for a all share based payments granted after the effective date and b awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of the statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas we have historically accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  and as such  generally have recognized no compensation cost for employee equity incentives 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall liquidity 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r for currently outstanding but unvested options is approximately million based on the estimated fair values used to prepare the proforma disclosure information 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current requirements 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption

this cash portfolio exposes us to interest rate risk as short term investment rates can be volatile 
given the short term maturity structure of our investment portfolio  we believe that it is not subject to principal fluctuations and the effective interest rate of our portfolio tracks closely to various short term money market interest rate benchmarks
