management s discussion and analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of the company s segments 
the company has chosen to specifically address the non gaap measures  reported ebitda defined as segment net revenues less segment operating expenses plus gain on transfer of property  as applicable  plus or minus segment equity income or loss  reported ebitda excluding stock based compensation and net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents  in the following discussion because management considers these measurements to be significant indications of the company s financial performance and available capital resources 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources to its segments based on reported ebitda and reported ebitda excluding stock based compensation 
the company primarily uses reported ebitda excluding stock based compensation targets in determining management bonuses 
additionally  the company believes that reported ebitda excluding stock based compensation is an important measurement for comparability purposes as prior periods do not reflect the impact of the adoption of sfas r 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of reported ebitda and reported ebitda excluding stock based compensation to net income loss 
management also believes that net debt is an important measurement as it is an indicator of the company s ability to obtain additional capital resources for its future cash needs

overview the company s operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate  which represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenues for the year ended july  the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of five ski resort properties as well as ancillary businesses  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
mountain segment revenue is seasonal in nature  the majority of which is earned in the company s second and third quarters 
operations within the lodging segment include ownership management of a group of eight luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including four proximate to the company s ski resorts  the operations of gtlc  the ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to the company s ski resorts and golf course operations 
the real estate segment is involved with the development of property in and around the company s resort properties 
the company s single largest source of revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of total net revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively 
lift ticket revenues are driven by volume skier visits and average pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
over the past three years the company has experienced increased skier visits and the industry as a whole has in the last seven years experienced the six best seasons in terms of visitation  in its history 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories out of state and international guests destination and in state and local visitors in state 
destination guests comprise approximately of the company s skier visits  while the in state market comprises approximately of the company s skier visits 
nearly of total visitors and of destination visitors utilize airline transportation to arrive at the company s resorts 
destination guests generally purchase the company s higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services like ski school  lodging and retail rental 
destination guests are less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  due to the advance planning required for their trip  but can be impacted by the economy including the strength of the us dollar and the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more weather sensitive and value oriented  to mitigate against this  the company markets season passes to in state guests and from which the company generated of total lift revenue for the year ended july  the company continues to make capital investments in its ski operations  which it believes exceed what is typical in the industry  in an effort to provide a superior resort experience  which together with the overall quality of the company s ski resort offerings allows the company to continue charging some of the highest ticket prices in the industry 
the cost structure of ski resort operations is largely fixed  as such  incremental revenue generally has high associated profit margin 
lodging properties at or around the company s ski resorts  which represented approximately  and of the lodging segments revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively  are closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment  particularly with respect to visitation from destination guests 
revenues from hotel management operations under the rockresorts brand are generated through management fees based upon the revenue of the individual hotel properties within the rockresorts portfolio  and to the extent that these managed properties are not proximate to the company s ski resorts  they are more subject to the seasonality of those hotels and trends within the overall travel industry 
revenues of the lodging segment during the company s first and fourth quarters are generated primarily by the operations of gtlc as gtlc s peak operating season occurs during the summer months  a nps concession within the park  as well as golf operations and seasonally low operations from the company s other owned and managed properties 
the company s real estate segment engages in both vertical development of projects and the sale of land to developers  which generally includes the retention of some control in the oversight and design of the projects and a contingent revenue structure based on the sale of the developed units 
the company attempts to mitigate the risk of vertical development by utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts  pre selling all or a portion of the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits and obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects 
the company s real estate development projects also may create certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the resort segment 
the company s real estate revenues fluctuate based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  thus increasing the volatility of real estate operating results from period to period 
in the near term  the majority of real estate revenues will be generated from vertical development projects that are currently under construction  in which revenues will be recorded at the time of real estate closing  after the investment has been made 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
the company s management has identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact the company s future financial performance the timing and amount of snowfall has an impact on skier visits 
to mitigate this impact  the company focuses efforts on sales of season passes prior to the beginning of the season to in state skiers  as most weather sensitive visitors to the company s ski resorts tend to be from the colorado front range  to whom the company markets season pass products 
additionally  the company has invested in snowmaking upgrades in an effort to address the inconsistency of early season snowfall where possible 
in the year ended july   season pass sales represented of total lift revenues  which represented approximately of total net revenues for the mountain segment 
season pass sales to date for the season indicate favorable trends in revenue 
however  there can be no certainty that such favorable trends will continue in the future 
consistent with prior years  the company plans to raise prices on all lift ticket products  including season pass products  for the ski season and continues to charge some of the highest prices in the industry 
while pricing increases historically have not reduced demand  there can be no assurances that demand will remain price inelastic 
the company operates its ski areas under various forest service permits  and many of the company s operations require permits and approval from governmental authorities  therefore many of the company s on mountain capital improvements must go through an approval process 
changes or impacts of the regulatory environment applicable to the company may have detrimental effects on the company 
during the years ended july  and  the company successfully executed its strategy to reduce hotel ownership in favor of selectively increasing its managed property portfolio 
sales of owned hotel properties included srl s in january  rancho mirage in july  vail marriott in june and the sale of the company s investment in the bg resort in december the company retained management contracts for srl s  rancho mirage and vail marriott  although the rancho mirage contract was subsequently terminated in the first quarter of the year ending july  in conjunction with the closing of the hotel by the new owners for redevelopment purposes 
the company continues to evaluate potential sales and other strategic initiatives which could also involve the conversion of hotel rooms to real estate product with respect to some of its lodging properties  however  the company does not anticipate future sales of hotel properties will approach the magnitude of recent activity 
the sale of owned hotel properties results in lodging reported ebitda no longer reflecting the operating results of the hotels  but includes management fee revenue in cases where the management contract is retained 
see results of operations for information regarding the financial impacts of these transactions 
potential ownership changes of hotels currently under rockresorts management could result in the termination of existing rockresorts management contracts  which could impact the results of operations of the lodging segment 
in august  rockresorts management agreement for rancho mirage was terminated in conjunction with the closing of the hotel as part of a of redevelopment plan by the current hotel owner  which will result in the company earning a termination fee subsequent to july   but loss of future management fees 
rockresorts recognized  in revenue related to the management of this property in the year ended july  however  the company continues to pursue new management contracts  which may include  in addition to management fees  marketing license fees and technical service fees in conjunction with a project s development and sales 
on march   rockresorts was notified by the ownership of cheeca  formerly a rockresorts managed property  that its management agreement was being terminated effective immediately 
rockresorts recognized  in revenue related to the management of this property in the year ended july  its last full year of the company s management of the property 
rockresorts believes and asserts that the termination is in violation of the management agreement and is seeking recovery of monetary damages for the loss of the remaining years of management fees  inclusive of renewal periods under the contract  attorneys fees and costs 
pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of the management agreement  the disputed matter is pending before a single judge arbitrator at the jams arbitration tribunal in chicago  illinois 
the arbitration hearing is scheduled to conclude in early october  and the company expects the arbitrator to render a decision by the end of the second quarter for the year ending july  cheeca holdings  llc  the entity owner of the hotel property  asserts that rockresorts breached the management contract  among other alleged breaches  and seeks a ruling that it had a right to terminate the management agreement and recovery of monetary damages  attorneys fees and costs 
the company has recorded million in legal related costs classified as contract dispute charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations in the year ended july  as a result of legal action against the hotel owner and anticipates incurring substantially more legal related costs until this matter is resolved 
gtlc operates three lodging properties  food and beverage services  retail  camping and other services within the park under a concession contract with the nps 
in accordance with federal law  the nps had considered competitive bids for a new concession contract as the company s contract had expired  and in may  the company was informed it was awarded a new year agreement to continue as the concessionaire for gtlc 
the company expects to execute the contract within the current calendar year 
provisions of the new agreement include an increase in the nps franchise fee 
on an annual basis  effective january   assuming final approval by the united states congress and the nps  the company will pay approximately million more annually in franchise fees to the nps than it has previously incurred 
additionally  the company expects the new contract will require capital improvement outlays in excess of historical expenditures 
in recent years  the company has shifted its real estate focus to more vertical development  which requires significant capital investment prior to project completion 
for example  the company expects to incur between million and million of construction costs subsequent to july  on the arrabelle and the lodge at vail chalets projects including the construction of related resort depreciable assets 
the company mitigates the risk associated with vertical development by utilizing the following the company generally pre sells residential units and requires non refundable deposits of at least of the sales prices 
pre sales require buyers to provide earnest money deposits to the company  which would be refundable to the buyer should the company fail to complete the related development 
pre sale targets are set by management 
generally  the company strives to meet its pre sale targets in the period between the commencement of the marketing of a development and the planned commencement of construction  the company attempts to secure guaranteed maximum price contracts with its general contractors which helps protect the company against rising costs of construction and the company generally uses non recourse financing for its vertical development projects that only allow for recourse against the specific project s assets 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate under contract 
changes to the anticipated timing of closing on one or more real estate units could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
additionally  the magnitude of real estate projects currently under development or contemplated could result in a significant increase in real estate reported ebitda as these projects close  expected in the year ending july  and beyond 
however  continual increases in construction costs  including construction related commodities  have resulted in increases in the total costs for certain of the company s current development projects 
additionally  the profitability and or viability of current or proposed real estate development projects could be adversely affected by continued escalation in construction costs and or a slow down in market demand  as well as project difficulties or delays and the resulting potential negative financial impact associated with design or construction issues that may arise in the course of construction 
the company and the minority shareholder in ssv have put and call rights whereby starting on august   each of the company and the minority shareholder may call or put the remaining minority interest in ssv to the company 
execution of the put or call by either party may modify the management agreement of ssv and could impact the company s ownership percentage and the way the ssv business is managed 
the company has entered into preliminary discussions with the minority shareholder  with the intent of both parties being to extend the existing management agreement 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  with no borrowings under its revolver and expects to generate additional cash from operations including future closures on real estate 
the company is currently evaluating how to use its excess cash  including a combination of the following strategic options increase real estate investment for further development  increase resort capital expenditures  pursue strategic acquisitions  pay cash dividends  repurchase additional stock of the company see note  capitalization  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s stock repurchase plan or payoff outstanding debt 
the company s debt generally has favorable fixed interest rates and is long term in nature 
additionally  the company s credit facility and indenture limit the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase stock and pay off certain of its debt  including its notes 
the company uses many methods  estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead the company to change its methods  estimates and judgments 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect the company s results of operations 
due to the adoption of sfas r  the company s operating expenses have increased by million for the year ended july   as compared to the previous year  after considering the change in the company s compensation strategy to issue a portion of its stock based compensation as restricted stock to certain levels of employees

the company generated million of cash from operating activities during the year ended july   compared to million and million generated during the years ended july  and  respectively 
for the last three fiscal years  the company s cash flows from operations have been substantially impacted by an increase in resort ebitda the combination of mountain reported ebitda and lodging reported ebitda 
cash flows from operations for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july   were negatively impacted by a reduction in cash flows due to the timing of real estate closings and a change in the classification of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas r  which resulted in a reduction in cash flow from operations  offset by an increase in cash flow from financing activities for the year ended july  additionally  included within investing activities  the company generated million of cash from the sale of srl s in the year ended july   and generated million of cash from the sale of the vail marriott and rancho mirage in the year ended july  the company does not currently anticipate future cash from the sale of businesses in the near term 
the company s financing activities generated million of cash in the year ended july  primarily due to cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  net proceeds from real estate financings of million and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a result of the adoption sfas r  as discussed above  of million  which were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of million 
in the year ended july   the company used million in financing activities  which was primarily due to the payoff of the million credit facility term loan 
in addition to the company s million of cash and cash equivalents  the company has available million under its credit facility as of july  the credit agreement and the indenture contain restrictions that limit the company s ability to make investments or distributions  including the payment of dividends and or the repurchase of the company s common stock 
in addition  the indenture restricts how the funds from sales of businesses can be used and the timing of the use of such funds  generally requiring the net proceeds from such transactions to be invested in capital improvements  acquisitions  retirement of debt senior to the notes or used to tender for a portion of the notes outstanding 
the company cannot predict whether cash generated from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit will continue at the level generated in the year ended july  of million  which was included within financing activities  however  as of july   there were  exercisable options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in the year ended july   the company s compensation committee altered its compensation philosophy by making restricted share awards and sars a more significant portion of total incentive compensation and reducing the aggregate number of stock options granted 
this change in compensation strategy could have a long term impact on cash generated from the exercise of stock options  with an offset of fewer shares issued as equity compensation 
the company expects that its liquidity needs in the near term will be met by continued utilization of operating cash flows and through borrowings under a construction loan agreement with arrabelle at vail square  llc arrabelle llc as well as potential similar non recourse financings on certain other real estate projects including the lodge at vail chalets  and borrowings  if necessary  under the credit facility see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information on the construction loan agreement with arrabelle llc 
as of july  and  total long term debt including long term debt due within one year was million and million  respectively 
net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents declined from million as of july  to million as of july  this reduction in net debt places the company in a position to better take advantage of potential strategic options as further discussed below  as the company has no borrowings under its credit facility and is building cash reserves 
the company is currently evaluating how to use its excess cash  including a combination of the following strategic options increase real estate investment for further development  increase resort capital expenditures  pursue strategic acquisitions  pay cash dividends  repurchase additional stock of the company or payoff outstanding debt 
the company s debt generally has favorable fixed interest rates and is long term in nature 
additionally  the company s credit facility and the indenture limit the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase stock and pay off certain of its debt  including its notes 
significant uses of cash for the year ended july   the company used million in cash for investing activities  which represents a million increase over the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of significant vertical development underway in the company s real estate operations million increase in investments in real estate and a decrease of million in net proceeds from the sale of businesses 
the company s cash needs typically include providing for operating expenditures  debt service requirements and capital expenditures for both assets to be used in operations and real estate development projects 
in addition  the company expects it will incur significant cash income tax payments generally expected to approximate its statutory income tax rate due to the improved operating results  the limitations on the usage of nols generated in prior periods and an anticipated decline in tax benefits resulting from stock option exercises 
historically  the company has not been a significant cash income tax payer 
the company expects to spend approximately million to million in calendar year for real estate development projects  including the construction of associated resort related depreciable assets  of which million was spent as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of calendar as indicated in the table under contractual obligations below  the company has significant cash commitments in the near term 
these commitments are primarily related to the completion of several major real estate development projects under construction 
the company has entered into contracts with third parties to provide construction related services to the company throughout the course of construction for these projects  commitments for future services to be performed over the next several years under such contracts total approximately million 
the primary projects are expected to include continued construction and development costs  as well as planning and infrastructure costs associated with planned development projects in and around each of the company s ski areas 
the company expects real estate capital expenditures will be higher than historical levels for the next several years as the company continues its vertical development efforts 
the company has not finalized its specific real estate capital plan for calendar as noted above  the company obtained non recourse financing to fund construction of the arrabelle and gore creek projects 
the company expects to utilize similar financing arrangements for certain other development projects 
in addition to utilizing project specific financing  the company also pre sells units requiring deposits in a proposed development prior to committing to the completion of the development  thereby helping to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete the project 
the company has historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for its resort mountain and lodging operations  and expects to continue to invest significant cash in the future 
the company evaluates additional capital improvements based on expected strategic impacts and or expected return on investment 
the company currently anticipates it will spend million to million of resort capital expenditures for calendar excluding projects arising from real estate activities noted above  of which million was spent as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of calendar this capital investment will allow the company to maintain its high quality standards  as well as for incremental discretionary improvements including those at the company s five ski resorts and throughout its hotels 
included in these annual capital expenditures are approximately million to million which are necessary to maintain the appearance and level of service appropriate to the company s resort operations 
highlights of the proposed discretionary expenditures include a new gondola at breckenridge to connect the town to peaks and  snowmaking upgrades at vail  beaver creek  keystone and breckenridge  on mountain restaurant upgrades at vail  beaver creek and heavenly  marketing and sales related technology enhancements  and leasehold improvements for the new corporate headquarters  among other projects

principal payments on the vast majority of the company s long term debt million of the total million debt outstanding as of july  are not due until fiscal and beyond 
maturities during the year ending july   which total million  include million under the industrial development bonds  which was paid in september interest expense under the company s debt will be approximately million in the year ending july   assuming the debt remains at its current level and assuming current interest rates 
the company s debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause the company s annual interest payments to change by approximately  the fluctuation in the company s debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under its credit facility revolver or other alternative financing arrangements it may enter into 
the company s long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results which impact the borrowing capacity under the credit facility revolver  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
the company manages changes in the business and economic environment by managing its capital expenditures and real estate development activities

acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
the company is under no obligation to purchase any additional shares under the stock repurchase program and the timing as well as the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors including the company s future financial performance  the company s available cash resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future  the restrictions in the credit facility and in the indenture  prevailing prices of the company s common stock  and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that the company believes are attractive 
the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s capitalization 
covenants and limitations the company must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants in relation to its credit facility and the indenture 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit facility covenants funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  senior debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum net worth and the interest coverage ratio each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  the company s financing arrangements limit its ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit its ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on the company s segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all relevant covenants in its debt instruments as of july  the company expects it will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in its credit agreement  including the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  the company would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility 
while the company anticipates that it would obtain such waiver or amendment  if any were necessary  there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the company 
capital structure in september  the company and apollo ski partners  lp apollo entered into a conversion and registration rights agreement the conversion agreement  pursuant to which apollo converted all of its class a common stock into shares of the company s common stock 
apollo distributed the shares to its partners in proportion to each partner s interest in the partnership 
apollo did not dissolve after this distribution and continues to exist as a partnership 
the company  pursuant to the conversion agreement  filed a shelf registration statement in november which has since been withdrawn covering certain of the shares owned by the limited partners of apollo 
as a result of this conversion agreement  the company now has only one class of directors 
previously  the holders of the company s class a common stock elected the class directors and the holders of the company s common stock elected the class directors 
contractual obligations as part of its ongoing operations  the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements and debt agreements 
debt obligations  which total million as of july   are recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of july  operating lease obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with gaap 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands payments due by period more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt fixed rate interest operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments included in the table above assume that all fixed rate debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that the amounts outstanding under variable rate long term debt as of july  are held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   the company anticipates that its annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  will be in the range of million to million for at least the next five years 
the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt or on non recourse financing associated with real estate development 
purchase obligations include amounts which are classified as trade payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued taxes  accrued interest  and commitments including advances to complete real estate projects on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other commitments for goods and services not yet received 
other long term obligations include amounts which become due based on deficits in underlying cash flows of the metropolitan district as described in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require the company to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
real estate revenue and cost of sales 
description the company utilizes the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units sold within a project  when specific identification of costs cannot be reasonably determined 
the determination of cost of sales under the relative sales value method may utilize estimates for both the ultimate total revenues to be recognized and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
real estate development projects generally span several years 
judgments and uncertainties changes to either total projected revenue to be earned or the total projected costs to be incurred for projects utilizing the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales may cause significant variances in the profit margins recognized on individual parcels within a project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimates of either future revenues to be earned or costs to be incurred for projects utilizing the relative sales value method would have changed the profit margin recognized by approximately million for the year ended july  intangible assets 
description the company frequently obtains intangible assets  including goodwill  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the assistance of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  amortized over their estimated useful life  or not amortized  the assigned values and lives  when applicable  could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment under sfas no 
as of may  or whenever events may indicate a possible impairment exists 
future operating results could trigger significant future non cash impairment charges 
judgments and uncertainties the company determines fair value using current market values and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and a royalty rate model 
these types of analyses require the company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding economic factors and the future operating results of certain business operations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company completed the annual impairment testing of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the year ended july   which resulted in no impairment being recorded  using the methodology described herein 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets tested would not have had a significant impact on the test results 
income taxes 
description the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
this assessment is complicated by the fact that the company files its tax return on a calendar year basis which is different from its fiscal year end 
as of july   the company had total deferred tax assets of million before valuation allowances and total deferred tax liabilities of million 
the net deferred tax asset contains a valuation allowance representing the portion that management does not believe will be recovered from future taxable income 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future  primarily through the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  to realize the benefit of the company s deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances have not been recorded against 
judgments and uncertainties the company has approximately million tax effected of nols carryforward as of july  for which it has not recorded a valuation allowance against 
the company is relying on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and generation of future income to utilize this carryforward 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the company were to incur substantial tax losses for a number of years  the carryforward for which it has not recorded a valuation allowance against could expire without being utilized resulting in an increased tax expense in the period that the company believes that it more likely than not the carryforward will not be realized 
tax contingencies 
description the company is subject to periodic review by domestic tax authorities for audit of the company s income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with the company s various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  the company recorded reserves for probable exposure 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which the company may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
the internal revenue service has completed its exam of the company s tax returns for tax years through and has issued a report of its findings 
the examiner s primary finding is the disallowance of the company s position to remove the restrictions under section of the internal revenue code of approximately million of nols 
these restricted nols relate to fresh start accounting from the company s reorganization in the company has appealed the examiner s disallowance of these nols to the office of the appeals 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with the company s various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and it has adequate reserves for its tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in the company s tax expense in the year of settlement or in future years resulting in additional cash being generated from operating activities  a reduction in the effective tax rate in the year of resolution and may require adjustments to the company s deferred tax assets  liabilities or intangible assets 
additionally  a favorable outcome could result in a reduction in taxes owed to government agencies over the next several years 
depreciable lives of assets 
description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture  computer equipment  software and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or the company could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s useful life of the assets contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended july  new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
effective august   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under that method  compensation cost recognized in the year ended july  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r on august   the company s income before income taxes and net income for the year ended july  decreased million and million  respectively  as compared to accounting for share based compensation under apb  after considering the change in the company s compensation strategy to issue a portion of its stock based compensation as restricted stock to certain levels of employees 
the after tax impact of stock based compensation recorded pursuant to sfas r resulted in a reduction in basic and diluted net income per share of for the year ended july  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  stock compensation plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information regarding the implementation of sfas r 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the requirements of fin are effective for the company s fiscal year beginning august  the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore has not yet determined the impact that fin will have on the company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenues and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and the company s owned golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses 
however  revenues and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from those managed properties and golf operations are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and other lodging operations 
during the year ended july   of total combined mountain and lodging revenues were earned during the second and third quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
labor market the company s mountain and lodging operations are largely dependent on a seasonal workforce 
the company recruits worldwide to fill staffing needs each season and utilizes visas to enable the use of foreign workers 
in addition  the company manages seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place 
while the company does not currently foresee the need to increase seasonal wages to attract employees  the company cannot guarantee that such an increase will not be necessary in the future 
in addition  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the visas necessary to hire foreign workers who are an important source for the seasonal workforce 
increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  however  the company is unable to predict with any certainty whether such situations will arise or the potential impact on results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during the year ended july  of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor would have caused the company s annual interest payments to change by  the company s market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
