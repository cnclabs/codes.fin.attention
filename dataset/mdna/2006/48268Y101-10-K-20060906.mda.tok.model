item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations of k sea transportation partners lp and  prior to our january  initial public offering  of our predecessor company  ew transportation llc  and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general we are a leading provider of refined petroleum product marine transportation  distribution and logistics services in the united states domestic marine transportation business 
we currently operate a fleet of tank barges  tankers and tugboats that serves a wide range of customers  including major oil companies  oil traders and refiners 
with approximately million barrels of capacity  we believe we currently operate the largest coastwise tank barge fleet in the united states  as measured by barrel carrying capacity 
demand for our services is driven primarily by demand for refined petroleum products in the east  west and gulf coast regions of the united states 
we generate revenue by charging customers for the transportation and distribution of their products utilizing our tank vessels and tugboats 
these services are generally provided under the following four basic types of contractual relationships time charters  which are contracts to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time  generally one year or more  at a set daily rate  contracts of affreightment  which are contracts to provide transportation services for products over a specific trade route  generally for one or more years  at a negotiated per barrel rate  voyage charters  which are charters for shorter intervals  usually a single round trip  that are made on either a current market rate or advance contractual basis  and bareboat charters  which are longer term agreements that allow a customer to operate one of our vessels and utilize its own operating staff without taking ownership of the vessel 
in addition  a variation of a voyage charter is known as a consecutive voyage charter 
under this arrangement  consecutive voyages are performed for a specified period of time 
the table below illustrates the primary distinctions among these types of contracts time charter contract of affreightment voyage charter bareboat charter typical contract length one year or more one year or more single voyage two years or more rate basis daily per barrel varies daily voyage expenses customer pays we pay we pay customer pays vessel operating expenses we pay we pay we pay we pay idle time customer pays as long as vessel is available for operations customer does not pay customer does not pay customer pays under a consecutive voyage charter  the customer pays for idle time 
see definitions below 
for contracts of affreightment and voyage charters  revenue is recognized based upon the relative transit time in each period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
although contracts of affreightment and certain contracts for voyage charters may be effective for a period in excess of one year  revenue is recognized over the transit time of individual voyages  which are generally less than ten days in duration 
for time charters and bareboat charters  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
one of the principal distinctions among these types of contracts is whether the vessel operator or the customer pays for voyage expenses  which include fuel  port charges  pilot fees  tank cleaning costs and canal tolls 
some voyage expenses are fixed  and the remainder can be estimated 
if we  as the vessel operator  pay the voyage expenses  we typically pass these expenses on to our customers by charging higher rates under the contract or re billing such expenses to them 
as a result  although voyage revenue from different types of contracts may vary  the net revenue that remains after subtracting voyage expenses  which we call net voyage revenue  is comparable across the different types of contracts 
therefore  we principally use net voyage revenue  rather than voyage revenue  when comparing performance between different periods 
since net voyage revenue is a non gaap measurement  it is reconciled to the nearest gaap measurement  voyage revenue  under results of operations below 
significant fiscal events acquisition of sea coast transportation on october   we completed the acquisition  through a wholly owned subsidiary  of all of the membership interests in sea coast transportation llc sea coast from marine resources group  inc mrg pursuant to the terms and conditions of a membership interest purchase agreement dated august  among us  mrg and saltchuk resources  inc also on october   sea coast acquired four tugboats from mrg 
sea coast is a provider of marine transportation and logistics services to major oil companies  oil traders and refiners along the west coast of the united states and alaska 
the aggregate purchase price for sea coast and the four tugboats comprised million in cash and  common units representing limited partner interests in us 
the common units were valued at million  as of the closing date 
we financed the cash portion of the purchase price through additional borrowings under our amended credit agreement 
a registration statement on form s with respect to the resale of the common units issued to mrg was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission in february under the purchase method of accounting  we recorded an aggregate purchase price of million  comprising million of cash  million in common units  and million of direct expenses 
we allocated the purchase price to the tangible assets  intangible assets  and liabilities acquired based on their fair values  which for the fixed assets and intangibles were based on consideration of independent appraisals 
the purchased identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been recorded as goodwill  which is not amortized but which will be reviewed annually for impairment 
barge incident on november   one of our tank barges  the dbl  struck a submerged service platform in the us gulf of mexico that had collapsed during hurricane rita in september to ensure the safety of all people involved and to mitigate environmental damage  we initiated  and completed in january  a detailed response plan in coordination with the united states coast guard  other federal and state agencies  our own personnel and response contractors 
at the time of the incident  the barge was carrying approximately  barrels of no 
fuel oil  a heavy oil product 
although the final amount has not been determined  we believe much of the oil escaped into the ocean 
however  according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  the likelihood of shoreline impact from the incident is low 
the barge was declared a constructive total loss  and we have received the total million insured value from our hull and machinery insurers 
the excess of this insurance recovery over the net book value of the barge  totaling million  is included as a net gain on disposal of vessel in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june  we maintain significant protection and indemnity insurance for pollution related costs and claims  including cleanup costs and environmental damages  with the west of england ship owners insurance association  a member of the international group of protection and indemnity clubs  and we believe that such coverage will be adequate to cover the cost of the clean up operations and any subsequent claims  fines or penalties 
we do not maintain loss of hire insurance 
the cause of the incident is under investigation by the united states coast guard  and by us and our insurers 
we  along with our insurers  are considering the appropriate legal action  including insurance and other recovery claims 
definitions in order to understand our discussion of our results of operations  it is important to understand the meaning of the following terms used in our analysis and the factors that influence our results of operations voyage revenue 
voyage revenue includes revenue from time charters  contracts of affreightment and voyage charters  where we  as vessel operator  pay the vessel operating expenses 
voyage revenue is impacted by changes in charter and utilization rates and by the mix of business among the types of contracts described in the preceding sentence 
voyage expenses 
voyage expenses include items such as fuel  port charges  pilot fees  tank cleaning costs and canal tolls  which are unique to a particular voyage 
depending on the form of contract and customer preference  voyage expenses may be paid directly by customers or by us 
if we pay voyage expenses  they are included in our results of operations when they are incurred 
typically when we pay voyage expenses  we add them to our freight rates at an approximate cost 
net voyage revenue 
net voyage revenue is equal to voyage revenue less voyage expenses 
as explained above  the amount of voyage expenses we incur for a particular contract depends upon the form of the contract 
therefore  in comparing revenues between reporting periods  we use net voyage revenue to improve the comparability of reported revenues that are generated by the different forms of contracts 
since net voyage revenue is a non gaap measurement  it is reconciled to the nearest gaap measurement  voyage revenue  under results of operations below 
bareboat charter and other revenue 
bareboat charter and other revenue includes revenue from bareboat charters and from towing and other miscellaneous services 
vessel operating expenses 
the most significant direct vessel operating expenses are wages paid to vessel crews  routine maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
we may also incur outside towing expenses during periods of peak demand and in order to maintain our operating capacity while our tugs are drydocked or otherwise out of service for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance 
depreciation and amortization 
we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of the historical cost of our fleet and the amortization of expenditures for drydockings 
the aggregate number of drydockings undertaken in a given period  the size of the vessels and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures 
we capitalize expenditures incurred for drydocking and amortize these expenditures over months 
we also amortize  over periods ranging from four to ten years  intangible assets in connection with vessel acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of employment costs of shoreside staff and the cost of facilities  as well as legal  audit  insurance and other administrative costs 
total tank vessel days 
total tank vessel days is equal to the number of calendar days in the period multiplied by the total number of tank vessels operating or in drydock during that period 
scheduled drydocking days 
scheduled drydocking days are days designated for the inspection and survey of tank vessels  and identification and completion of required refurbishment work  as required by the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping to maintain the vessels qualification to work in the us coastwise trade 
generally  drydockings are required twice every five years and last between and days  based upon the size of the vessel and the type and extent of work required 
net utilization 
net utilization is a primary measure of operating performance in our business 
net utilization is a percentage equal to the total number of days worked by a tank vessel or group of tank vessels during a defined period  divided by total tank vessel days for that tank vessel or group of tank vessels 
net utilization is adversely impacted by scheduled drydocking  scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and idle time not paid for by the customer 
average daily rate 
average daily rate  another key measure of our operating performance  is equal to the net voyage revenue earned by a tank vessel or group of tank vessels during a defined period  divided by the total number of days actually worked by that tank vessel or group of tank vessels during that period 
fluctuations in average daily rates result not only from changes in charter rates charged to our customers  but also from changes in vessel utilization and efficiency  which could result from internal factors  such as newer and more efficient tank vessels  and from external factors such as weather or other delays 
coastwise and local trades 
our business is segregated into coastwise trade and local trade 
our coastwise trade generally comprises voyages of between and  miles by vessels with greater than  barrels of barrel carrying capacity 
these voyages originate from the mid atlantic states to points as far north as canada and as far south as cape hatteras  from points within the gulf coast region to other points within that region or to the northeast  and to and from points on the west coast of the united states and alaska 
we also own two non jones act tank barges that transport petroleum products internationally 
our local trade generally comprises voyages by smaller vessels of less than miles 
the term us coastwise trade  as used generally for jones act purposes  would include our coastwise and local trades

fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  voyage revenue and voyage expenses voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to voyage revenue of million for the fiscal year ended june  voyage expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to voyage expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june  net voyage revenue net voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to net voyage revenue of million for the fiscal year ended june  in our coastwise trade  net voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  net utilization in our coastwise trade remained constant at for each fiscal year 
the acquisition of sea coast in october resulted in increased coastwise net voyage revenue of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal other increases for the year ended june  included million in coastwise net voyage revenue resulting from an increase in days worked by the following vessels the dbl  which was placed in service in june  the ktc  which was placed in service in january  the spring creek  which was in shipyard for most of the fiscal second quarter in preparation for a new time charter which commenced in january  the dbl  which was placed in service in january  the mccleary s spirit  a canadian flag vessel which was purchased in october  and the dbl  which returned to service in september after its double hulling 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in coastwise net voyage revenue during fiscal resulting from the phase out of the ktc and ktc in december  and the loss of the dbl as discussed above under significant fiscal events barge incident 
coastwise net voyage revenue also benefited from a increase in average daily rates to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   which accounted for approximately million of increased net voyage revenue 
coastwise average daily rates were positively impacted by the continuing strong demand for petroleum products and increasing oil prices 
net voyage revenue in our local trade for the year ended june  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  the acquisition of sea coast in october resulted in increased local net voyage revenue of million for fiscal additionally  local net voyage revenue increased by million during the year ended june  due to the increased number of work days for vessels acquired in our norfolk acquisition in december the newbuild barges dbl and dbl  delivered during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  contributed million of net voyage revenue 
net utilization in our local trade was for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  average daily rates in our local trade increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the comparative prior year  positively impacted by higher charter rates resulting from strong market conditions  which accounted for approximately million of increased net voyage revenue 
bareboat charter and other revenue bareboat charter and other revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  of this million increase  million resulted from increased revenue from our water treatment plant in norfolk  and an additional million was generated by outside chartering of tank barges by sea coast 
vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  vessel operating expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june   resulting mainly from a higher such percentage for the sea coast vessels acquired in october four of the sea coast barges are chartered in  and we pay a charter fee that is included in vessel operating expenses 
the charter fee increases the percentage of vessel operating expenses to net voyage revenue  however  there is no associated depreciation or interest expense 
vessel labor and related costs increased as a result of contractual labor rate increases and a higher average number of employees due to the operation of the additional barges described under net voyage revenue above  an additional tugboat purchased in october  and integration of the additional vessels purchased in december insurance costs and vessel repairs and supplies also increased as a result of the operation of the larger number of vessels 
outside towing expense increased by million due to the need for additional tugboats to satisfy increased demand for our tank vessels  and to replace certain of our tugboats during coupling and re powering projects 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from additional depreciation and drydocking amortization on our newbuild and purchased vessels described above  plus million in amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of sea coast 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of net voyage revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the million increase reflected million of increased personnel and facilities costs in support of our growth  including the norfolk and sea coast acquisitions  and million in costs related to a cancelled bond offering 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million for the year ended june   or million higher than the year ended june  the increase resulted from higher average debt balances resulting from increased credit line and term loan borrowings in connection with the norfolk vessel acquisitions in fiscal  the sea coast acquisition in october  and higher average interest rates 
loss on reduction of debt in connection with the redemption of the title xi bonds  as described under title xi bonds below  we made a make whole payment of million 
after writing off million in unamortized deferred financing costs relating to these bonds  and after costs and expenses relating to the transaction  we recorded a loss on reduction of debt of million 
we recorded an additional million of loss on reduction of debt in april resulting from the write off of deferred financing costs relating to a downsizing of our revolving credit facility 
in connection with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and repayment of certain term loans in march  we incurred a million loss on reduction of debt 
included in this amount was million in deferred financing costs related to the repaid debt that were written off  and million of prepayment costs 
provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal  our effective tax rate increased to  compared to in fiscal  owing to an increased amount of non us taxes incurred relative to our operations in puerto rico  venezuela and canada 
our effective tax rate comprises the new york city unincorporated business tax and foreign taxes on our operating partnership  plus federal  state  local and foreign corporate income taxes on the taxable income of the operating partnership s corporate subsidiaries 
net income net income was million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease resulted primarily from the million loss on reduction of debt  the million increase in interest expense  net  and the million increase in the provision for income taxes  which were partially offset by the million increase in operating income 
the year ended june  included a million loss on reduction of debt 
fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  voyage revenue and voyage expenses voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to voyage revenue of million for the fiscal year ended june  voyage expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to voyage expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june  net voyage revenue net voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to net voyage revenue of million for the fiscal year ended june  in our coastwise trade  net voyage revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  net utilization in our coastwise trade increased to for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june   due mainly to a decrease in scheduled drydocking days 
increases totaling million in coastwise net voyage revenue in fiscal resulted from an increase in days worked by the following vessels during fiscal as compared to fiscal the dbl  which was placed in service in january  the dbl  which was purchased in january  the dbl  which completed its modification for petroleum transportation and was placed in service in may  the dbl  which completed its double hull retrofitting in september  and the return of the ktc from bareboat charter in november these increases were partially offset by an aggregate million decrease in net voyage revenue during fiscal resulting from the sale of the ktc in april in anticipation of its opa phase out  and the opa phase out of the ktc and ktc in december coastwise net voyage revenue also benefited from a increase in average daily rates to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june   which accounted for approximately million of increased net voyage revenue 
average daily rates were positively impacted by the continuing strong demand for petroleum products  increasing oil prices  and the addition of the several larger vessels described above  which generate higher average daily rates 
net voyage revenue in our local trade for the fiscal year ended june  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the barges acquired as part of our december vessel acquisition  which accounted for million of the increase 
net utilization in our local trade was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  net utilization in fiscal was adversely impacted by higher unscheduled repair days for one of our small tankers and by low utilization on certain tank barges acquired in the december vessel acquisition 
average daily rates in our local trade improved slightly to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  bareboat charter and other revenue bareboat charter and other revenue was million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  amounts for the fiscal period increased by million due to revenue generated from chartering out of a chartered in barge 
vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  vessel operating expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  vessel labor and related costs increased as a result of contractual labor rate increases and a higher average number of employees due to the operation of the additional barges described under net voyage revenue above  an additional tugboat purchased in january  and integration of the additional vessels purchased in december insurance costs and vessel repairs and supplies also increased as a result of the operation of the larger number of vessels 
outside towing expense increased by million due to the need for additional tugboats to satisfy increased demand for our tank vessels  and to replace certain of our tugboats during coupling and re powering projects 
fiscal vessel operating expenses also increased by million for charter costs in connection with the bareboat charter revenue discussed above in bareboat charter and other revenue 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from additional depreciation on our newbuild and purchased vessels described above  plus additional depreciation recorded in the first quarter of fiscal to reduce the salvage value for the two single hull vessels which phased out on december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of net voyage revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the fiscal year ended june  included million of additional professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with being a public company 
these increased professional fees included million in costs for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and million of costs incurred in fiscal to provide income tax compliance information to our unitholders  neither of which were incurred in the prior year s period 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended june   million lower than the fiscal year ended june  the decrease resulted from the significant reduction of higher cost borrowings in connection with the repayment of debt using the proceeds of our initial public offering in january loss on reduction of debt in connection with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and repayment of certain term loans in march as described below in liquidity and capital resources amended credit agreement and other term loans  we incurred million in loss on reduction of debt 
included in this amount was million in deferred financing costs related to the repaid debt that were written off  and million of prepayment costs 
in connection with our initial public offering in fiscal  million in predecessor company debt was repaid 
included in this amount was million in prepayment and make whole amounts  of which million had previously been accrued by our predecessor as supplemental interest that would have been payable upon maturity of certain of these loans  resulting in a loss on prepayment of million 
in addition  million in deferred financing costs related to the debt was also written off 
provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal  our effective tax rate was  as compared to exclusive of the benefit discussed in the following paragraph in fiscal the periods prior to our initial public offering on january  relate to our predecessor 
our effective tax rate comprises the new york city unincorporated business tax and foreign taxes on our operating partnership  plus federal  state  and local corporate income taxes on the taxable income of the operating partnership s corporate subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  was lower than the rate for the fiscal year ended june  because a smaller portion of our pretax income was provided by our operating partnership s corporate subsidiaries 
certain net assets contributed to us in connection with our january initial public offering were transferred by our predecessor s corporate subsidiaries 
these net assets had tax bases that were lower than their carrying value for financial reporting purposes  which resulted in deferred tax liabilities relating to these temporary differences 
upon transfer to us  the future reversal of these differences will be subject to our effective tax rate  which is significantly lower than the effective tax rate of our predecessor s corporate subsidiaries 
the effect of the change in tax rates applicable to these differences is reflected as a one time deferred tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended june  net income net income was million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease resulted primarily from recognition in the period of the million deferred tax benefit described in the preceding paragraph  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense  net  a million decrease in loss on reduction of debt  and a million increase in operating income 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from a million increase in drydocking expenditures and a million negative impact from changes in operating working capital  partially offset by the improved operating income  after adjusting for non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
the increase of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  also resulted primarily from improved operating income  after adjusting for non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  and a million positive impact from changes in operating working capital 
the positive impact from working capital resulted mainly from increased accounts payable due to increased operating costs of a larger fleet  partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses such as fuel supplies and insurance premiums 
investing cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary elements of these activities were acquisitions of vessels and companies  construction of new vessels and retrofitting of existing ones 
we spent million in cash  net  to acquire sea coast transportation llc see below in october additionally  we spent million  million and million on acquisitions of existing vessels in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we acquired an  barrel integrated tug barge unit for approximately million  including transaction costs 
during fiscal  we acquired ten tank barges and seven tugboats from bay gulf trading company  ltd 
of norfolk  virginia and its affiliates 
the purchase price of million excluding acquisition related costs  included a water treatment facility in norfolk 
the fiscal acquisitions included the norfolk vessels and also the dbl  which was acquired in june construction expenditures for our tank vessel newbuilding program and rebuilding projects totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal such construction expenditures in fiscal were funded by million of withdrawals from our title xi reserve account  which had been established with the proceeds of our original title xi borrowings in other capital expenditures of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal related primarily to repowering of  and installation of coupling systems on  certain tugboats  and expenditures related to upgrading the vessels acquired in december capital expenditures made in the normal course of business are generally financed by cash from operations and  where necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
financing cash flows 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in fiscal  our primary financing activities were the issuance of million in new term loans and million in gross proceeds from the sale of  common units in october these proceeds were used to finance the sea coast acquisition and other investing activities described above 
additionally  we paid million to redeem the principal balance of the title xi bonds  and made million of distributions to partners 
we also amended our revolving credit facility see amended credit agreement below and increased our credit line borrowings by million 
as a result of a restructuring of our financial agreement for the title xi bonds in january  we were required to make monthly reserve fund deposits which were used to make semi annual debt service payments 
the principal portion of such deposits  which are reflected as principal payments to title xi reserve funds  were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
when we redeemed the title xi bonds in november  the balance of the title xi reserve funds  totaling million which are reflected as proceeds from title xi reserve funds in investing cash flows  was returned to us 
for more information  please read title xi borrowings below 
during fiscal  we increased our credit line borrowings and term loans by a net of million  primarily to finance vessel acquisitions 
we also paid million in distributions to our unitholders in fiscal in march  we signed a new five year million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  which replaced our then existing million credit agreement  which was repaid and terminated 
on june   we issued and sold  common units in a private placement for gross proceeds of million 
during fiscal  we completed our initial public offering and used the gross proceeds to pay down term loans and credit line borrowings including prepayment costs that had been contributed to us by our predecessor  to pay underwriting fees  professional fees and other offering expenses  and to redeem the  common units received by our predecessor in connection with the transfer of net assets to us concurrent with the initial public offering 
also in fiscal  we entered into million of new term loans to finance the purchase of the dbl lincoln sea and the dbl rebuilding project 
finally  we paid million in distributions to partners in fiscal oil pollution act of tank vessels are subject to the requirements of opa opa mandates that all single hull tank vessels operating in us waters be removed from petroleum and petroleum product transportation services at various times through january   and provides a schedule for the phase out of the single hull vessels based on their age and size 
at june   approximately of the barrel carrying capacity of our tank vessel fleet was double hulled in compliance with opa  and the remainder except one  barrel vessel which phases out in january will be in compliance with opa until january ongoing capital expenditures 
marine transportation of refined petroleum products is a capital intensive business  requiring significant investment to maintain an efficient fleet and to stay in regulatory compliance 
we estimate that  over the next five years  we will spend an average of approximately million per year to drydock and maintain our tank vessels operating capacity 
we expect such expenditures to approximate million in fiscal in addition  we anticipate that we will spend million annually for other general capital expenditures 
periodically  we also make expenditures to acquire or construct additional tank vessel capacity and or to upgrade our overall fleet efficiency 
for a further discussion of maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  please read footnote to the table in selected financial data in item of this report 
the following table summarizes total maintenance capital expenditures  including drydocking expenditures  and expansion capital expenditures for the periods presented in thousands years ended june  maintenance capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures including vessel acquisitions total capital expenditures construction of tank vessels in august  we signed an agreement to construct two additional  barrel tank barges 
one was delivered in august while the other is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of fiscal in november  we signed an agreement to construct a new  barrel tank barge that is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of fiscal these three vessels are expected to cost  in the aggregate and after the addition of certain special equipment  approximately million 
in june  we signed an agreement to construct an additional four new  barrel tank barges that are expected to be delivered in the first and second quarters of fiscal also in august  we signed an agreement to construct two  barrel tank barges that are expected to be delivered in the second and third quarters of fiscal these six vessels are expected to cost  in the aggregate and after addition of certain special equipment  approximately million 
we expect to finance these newbuildings from borrowings and cash from operations 
additionally  we intend to retire  retrofit or replace including three chartered in single hull tank vessels by december  which at june  represented approximately of our barrel carrying capacity 
the capacity of certain of these single hulled vessels has already been effectively replaced by double hulled vessels placed into service in the past two years 
we estimate that the current cost to replace the remaining capacity with newbuildings and by retrofitting certain of our existing vessels would range from million to million 
this capacity can also be replaced by acquiring existing double hulled tank vessels as opportunities arise 
we are currently evaluating the most cost effective means to replace this capacity 
liquidity needs 
our primary short term liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements  distributions to unitholders  and drydocking expenditures while our long term liquidity needs are primarily associated with expansion and other maintenance capital expenditures 
expansion capital expenditures are primarily for the purchase of vessels  while maintenance capital expenditures include drydocking expenditures and the cost of replacing tank vessel operating capacity 
our primary sources of funds for our short term liquidity needs are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  while our long term sources of funds are cash from operations  long term bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings 
we believe that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement  described under amended credit agreement below  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next months 
amended credit agreement 
in march  we entered into a new five year million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the new credit agreement replaced our then existing million revolving credit agreement  which was repaid and terminated 
on october   to partially finance the acquisition of sea coast see significant fiscal events above  we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase the available borrowings to million  of which million was drawn down to pay the cash portion of the purchase price 
on november   to fund the redemption of its title xi bonds see title xi bonds below  we further amended the revolving credit agreement to increase the maximum borrowings to million 
on april   we used the net proceeds from the issuance of million in new term loans to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  and further amended it to reduce the available borrowings  to release certain vessels from the collateral pool  and to reduce certain covenant requirements 
the amended credit agreement provides for available borrowings of million  contains a million sublimit for letters of credit and allows us to request an increase in the total borrowing availability by up to million  up to a maximum of million  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest  subject to permitted liens  on certain of our vessels having an orderly liquidation value equal to at least times the amount of the obligations including letters of credit outstanding

participate is working towards an agreement in principle with the new york taxing authority on a calculation methodology for the pbt 
we have accrued our estimated liability using the calculation methodology under discussion

seasonality we operate our tank vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and  as a result  in charter rates 
for example  movements of clean oil products  such as motor fuels  generally increase during the summer driving season 
in certain regions  movements of black oil products and distillates  such as heating oil  generally increase during the winter months  while movements of asphalt products generally increase in the spring through fall months 
unseasonably cold winters result in significantly higher demand for heating oil in the northeastern united states 
meanwhile  our operations along the west coast and in alaska historically have been subject to seasonal variations in demand that vary from those exhibited in the east coast and gulf coast regions 
the summer driving season can increase demand for automobile fuel in all of our markets and  accordingly  the demand for our services 
a decline in demand for  and level of consumption of  refined petroleum products could cause demand for tank vessel capacity and charter rates to decline  which would decrease our revenues and profitability 
the acquisition of sea coast provides seasonal diversity primarily relating to its alaskan markets  which experience the greatest demand for petroleum products in the summer months  due to weather conditions 
critical accounting policies the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is governed by generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and  in certain circumstances  requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and known facts that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment 
revenue recognition we earn revenue under contracts of affreightment  voyage charters  time charters and bareboat charters 
for contracts of affreightment and voyage charters  revenue is recognized based upon the relative transit time in each period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
although contracts of affreightment and certain contracts for voyage charters may be effective for a period in excess of one year  revenue is recognized over the transit time of individual voyages  which are generally less than ten days in duration 
for time charters and bareboat charters  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period  with expenses recognized as incurred 
estimated losses on contracts of affreightment and charters are accrued when such losses become evident 
depreciation vessels and equipment are recorded at cost  including capitalized interest where appropriate  and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets as follows tank vessels ten to twenty five years  tugboats ten to twenty years  and pier and office equipment five years 
for single hull tank vessels  these useful lives are limited to the remaining period of operation prior to mandatory retirement as required by opa also included in vessels are drydocking expenditures that are capitalized and amortized over three years 
major renewals and betterments of assets are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed 
to date  our experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate the recovery of the carrying amount of a vessel might not be possible 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of a vessel s carrying amount should be assessed might include a change in regulations such as opa  or continued operating losses  or projections thereof  associated with a vessel or vessels 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that a vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable  we would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value by appraisal 
our assumptions and estimates would include  but not be limited to  the estimated fair market value of the assets and their estimated future cash flows  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service of the asset and estimated salvage values 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
amortization of drydocking expenditures drydocking expenditures are capitalized and amortized over three years 
drydocking of vessels is required by both the us coast guard and by the applicable classification society  which in our case is the american bureau of shipping 
such drydocking activities include  but are not limited to  the inspection  refurbishment and replacement of steel  engine components  tailshafts  mooring equipment and other parts of the vessel 
amortization of drydocking expenditures is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
accounts receivable we extend credit to our customers in the normal course of business 
we regularly review our accounts  estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables each period  and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to our trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of our customers 
deferred income taxes we provide deferred taxes for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates in effect in the jurisdictions where we operate for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  for deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk is the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
after considering the interest rate swap agreement discussed below  as of june  approximately million of our long term debt bears interest at fixed interest rates ranging from to 
borrowings under our amended credit agreement and certain other term loans  totaling million at june   bear interest at a floating rate based on libor  which will subject us to increases or decreases in interest expense resulting from movements in that rate 
based on our total outstanding floating rate debt as of june   the impact of a change in interest rates would result in a change in interest expense  and a corresponding impact on income before income taxes  of approximately million annually 
we utilize an interest rate swap to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of this contract is to reduce the aggregate risk of higher interest costs associated with variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap contract we currently hold has been designated as a cash flow hedge and  accordingly  gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of this contract are recognized as other comprehensive income as required by sfas no 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to these instruments  however the counterparties are major financial institutions and we consider such risk of loss to be minimal 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had one outstanding interest rate swap agreement which expires on may  concurrently with the hedged term loans 
as of such date  the notional amount of the swap was million  we are paying a fixed rate of  and we are receiving a variable interest rate of
