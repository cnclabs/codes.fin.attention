item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the leading  and only international  company providing a make your own stuffed animal interactive entertainment experience under the build a bear workshop brand  in which our guests stuff  fluff  dress  accessorize and name their own teddy bears and other stuffed animals 
our concept  which we developed primarily for mall based retailing  capitalizes on what we believe is the relatively untapped demand for experience based shopping as well as the widespread appeal of stuffed animals 
the build a bear workshop experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics  including children  teens  their parents and grandparents 
as of december   we operated traditional stores in the united states  canada and puerto rico  stores in the united kingdom and two stores in ireland  and had franchised stores operating in international locations under the build a bear workshop brand 
in addition to our stores  we sell our products on our e commerce web site  buildabear 
com and market our products and build our brand through our virtual world web site  bearville 
com  which complements our interactive shopping experience and positively enhances our core brand value 
we also operate non traditional store locations in a major league baseball ballpark  a zoo  a science center  an airport and other temporary locations 
we operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure  including management  systems  merchandising and marketing  and generate revenues as follows company owned retail stores located in the united states  canada  puerto rico  the united kingdom and ireland  a web store and seasonal  event based locations  transactions with other business partners  mainly comprised of licensing our intellectual property  including entertainment properties  for third party use and wholesale product sales  and international stores operated under franchise agreements 
selected financial data attributable to each segment for fiscal  and  are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for a discussion of the key trends and uncertainties that have affected our revenues  income and liquidity  see the revenues  costs and expenses and expansion and growth potential subsections of this overview 
we believe that we have developed an appealing retail store concept that  for north american stores open for the entire year  averaged million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in net retail sales per store 
for a discussion of the changes in comparable store sales in fiscal years  and  see revenues below 
store contribution  which consists of income loss before income tax expense benefit  interest  store depreciation  amortization and impairment  goodwill impairment  losses from investment in affiliate  preopening and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from commercial activities and contribution from our web store  temporary and seasonal event based locations  as a percentage of net retail sales  excluding revenue from our web store  temporary and seasonal and event based locations  was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal total company net loss as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal and for fiscal total company net income as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal see non gaap financial measures for a reconciliation of store contribution to net loss income 
the net loss in was primarily attributable to the decrease in comparable store sales and the impairment of the company s goodwill related to its uk operations 
the net loss in was primarily attributable to the decrease in comparable store sales and the recording of a valuation allowance on the company s us deferred tax assets 
in  our results were negatively impacted by the declining sales in the uk 
in north america  the results reflect the early results of turnaround efforts  increased costs for marketing  newly imagined store design remodels and openings and store closings 
in  our results reflect stabilizing economic trends and modest mall traffic increases but continuing low levels of consumer confidence 
in  our store contribution percentage was essentially flat with  as declining sales were offset by lower store expenses  specifically payroll and supplies 
in  our results reflect the challenging retail environment economic recession  declining mall traffic  and slowing consumer spending factors impacting many retailers and particularly our company given the discretionary nature of our products and our experience 
our plan builds on steps taken in to balance our long term business goals while recognizing the continuing challenges of the retail environment 
we plan to improve store productivity and profitability by strategically closing to stores during the next two years and reducing the square footage of an additional to stores by relocating them within the same malls 
this initiative will allow us to focus on our business and align all operations around our goals of improving our comparable stores sales performance and store productivity  while also building our long term brand value 
we currently expect to transfer  on average  approximately of the sales from the closed stores to other stores in the same markets 
in  through march  we have closed stores 
our current plans also include the relocation or remodel of approximately locations in with the complete new design that feature a bold new look and enhanced experience as we continue to lead in the interactive experiential retail space 
while build a bear workshop in north america will operate fewer stores that we expect will have higher sales volumes and profitability  we will continue to grow internationally  primarily through our franchisees 
we also intend to increase shopping frequency by increasing new guest traffic to its stores  specifically focusing on families with children and intensifying digital engagement to increase visits from our existing guests and by reinforcing our store as a top destination for gifts 
in  we implemented cost reduction initiatives that resulted in approximately million in pre tax savings 
we were able to maintain these savings in and and saved an additional million in we achieved an additional million in savings in that were used to support sales driving marketing initiatives and were partially offset by product cost increases 
we ended fiscal with no borrowings under our bank loan agreement and with million in cash and cash equivalents after investing million in capital projects and million in share repurchases 
following is a description and discussion of the major components of our statement of operations revenues net retail sales net retail sales are revenues from retail sales including our web store and other non store locations  are net of discounts  exclude sales tax  include shipping and handling costs billed to customers  and are recognized at the time of sale 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
our guests use cash  checks  gift cards and third party credit cards to make purchases 
we classify stores as new  non comparable and comparable stores 
stores enter the comparable store calculation in their thirteenth full month of operation 
our web store and temporary  seasonal and event based locations are not included in our store count or in our comparable store calculations 
non comparable stores also result from a store relocation or remodel that results in a significant change in square footage 
the net retail sales for that location are excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the change 
we have a loyalty program with a frequent shopper reward feature  the stuff fur stuff club 
members of the program receive one point for every dollar spent and receive awards after reaching certain point thresholds 
on a quarterly basis  an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on actual points and awards outstanding and historical point conversion and award redemption patterns  is recorded as an adjustment to deferred revenue and net retail sales 
at the time of redemption of the award  the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales 
as the awards can be earned or redeemed at any of our store locations  we account for changes in the deferred revenue account at the total company level only 
therefore  when we refer to net retail sales by location  such as comparable stores or new stores  these amounts do not include any changes in the deferred revenue amount 
see critical accounting estimates for additional details on the accounting for the deferred revenue under our customer loyalty program 
we use net retail sales per gross square foot and comparable store sales as performance measures for our business 
the following table details net retail sales per gross square foot by age of store for the periods presented fiscal fiscal fiscal net retail sales per gross square foot north america store age years stores in  stores in store age years stores in  stores in store age years stores in  stores in all comparable stores net retail sales per gross square foot represents net retail sales from north american stores open throughout the entire period divided by the total gross square footage of such stores

fiscal consolidated comparable store sales decreased by  including an decrease in europe and a decrease in north america full year comparable store sales are compared to the week period ended dec 
 
we believe the primary drivers of the overall decline in consolidated comparable store sales for the full year were as follows in the first half of  we had benefit from higher redemption rates and transaction value of our holiday gift cards and from a promotion in the united states with mcdonald s happy meals that drove awareness of our brand and brought traffic to our stores resulting in slightly positive comparable store sales in north american through the first twenty six weeks 
in the fiscal third quarter  we experienced a decline in the number of transactions compared to the third quarter which benefitted from a strong product offering that was tied to a major theatrical release supported by studio marketing and advertising 
in the fiscal fourth quarter  we believe our new brand building marketing campaign in the united states along with a return to traditional holiday product offerings resulted in an increase in north american comparable store sales 
in the united kingdom  we believe the negative economic conditions contributed to a continued decline in consumer sentiment and a corresponding decline in spending that negatively impacted our comparable store sales throughout the year 
fiscal consolidated comparable store sales decreased by  including a decrease in europe and a decrease in north america full year comparable store sales are compared to the week period ended jan 
 
we believe the overall decline in consolidated comparable store sales for the full year was attributed primarily to the following factors through the third quarter  we had experienced a decrease in consolidated comparable store sale 
growth in third quarter sales  which resulted from improved merchandise assortments and successful promotional events  only partially offset comparable stores sales declines in the first half of the year  which were primarily driven by a decline in transactions and negative consumer sentiment and spending in the uk 
further sales declines in the fourth quarter  attributable to underperforming licensed movie product  resulted in a decline for the full year 
commercial revenue commercial revenue includes the company s transactions with other businesses  mainly through wholesale and licensing transactions 
revenue from licensing activities is generally based on a percentage of sales made by licensees to third parties and is recognized at the time the product is shipped by the licensee or at the point of sale 
we have entered into a number of licensing arrangements whereby third parties manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop trademark 
revenue from wholesale product sales includes revenue from merchandise sold at stores operated by third parties under licensing agreements like landry s restaurants 
in  it also includes two transactions totaling million with no associated gross margin 
franchise fees we receive an initial  one time franchise fee for each master franchise agreement which is amortized to revenue over the life of the respective franchise agreements  which extend for periods up to years 
master franchise rights are typically granted to a franchisee for an entire country or countries 
continuing franchise fees are based on a percentage of sales made by the franchisees stores and are recognized as revenue at the time of those sales

in  we achieved million in savings in selling  general and administrative expenses including marketing  central office payroll and outside services 
we were able to maintain these savings in and in  we saved an additional million in selling general and administrative expenses that were used to support sales driving marketing initiatives 
other store expenses such as credit card fees and supplies historically have increased or decreased proportionately with net retail sales 
we have share based compensation plans covering the majority of our management groups and our board of directors 
we account for share based payments utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of accounting standards codification asc section stock compensation

stores company owned stores the number of build a bear workshop stores in the united states  canada  puerto rico  the united kingdom  ireland and france for the last three fiscal years along with the projections for fiscal can be summarized as follows fifty two weeks ended december  projected december  opened closed december  north america traditional non traditional europe total fifty two weeks ended december  december  opened closed december  north america traditional non traditional europe total fifty two weeks ended december  january  opened closed december  north america traditional non traditional europe total our long term store real estate goal is to improve our stores sales productivity and profitability 
today we believe that the optimal number of build a bear workshop stores in north america is between and and approximately to in the united kingdom and ireland for a total of to stores 
we currently expect to reach the optimal level in north america with the closure of to stores in fiscal and locations to close and the timing of closures are subject to ongoing negotiations and overall economic considerations as we continually reevaluate our market repositioning and optimization plans 
integral to the success of our real estate optimization strategies is the opening of our new store design which gives certain stores destination appeal and increases productivity in the market 
the new design merges build a bear workshop s iconic hands on bear making process with the power of technology to provide an updated  highly interactive experience for our guests 
as of march   we have opened six of these stores  one new store and five remodels or relocations 
we expect to open additional remodeled locations by the end of in  we also opened one traditional store and one non traditional store in north america and two traditional stores in the uk 
the traditional store in north america is a reopening in a mall that had been closed since due to flooding 
we have been aggressively renegotiating rents and executing short term extensions to line up lease dates within markets as part of an overall strategic plan to optimize our store locations and market positioning 
as part of this strategy  we will continue to close underperforming stores in conjunction with natural lease expirations and kick out clauses  primarily in multi store markets 
in these markets  we currently expect to maintain approximately of the sales from closing stores by transferring customers to other locations in the same market 
we closed and stores in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we currently anticipate closing approximately to stores  including certain non traditional store locations  in and approximately additional stores in as a result  at the end of fiscal  we anticipate that we will have approximately traditional stores  in north america and in europe and six non traditional stores 
in through march  we have closed stores 
non traditional store locations in we began offering merchandise in seasonal  event based locations such as major league baseball ballparks 
as of december   we had one location each in a ballpark  a zoo  a science center  an airport and a hospital 
in  we opened our first temporary stores  which generally have lease terms of six to eighteen months and are excluded from our store count 
these locations are intended to capitalize on short term opportunities in specific locations 
as of december   we operated four temporary stores 
commercial revenue in fiscal  we began entering into license agreements pursuant to which we receive royalties on build a bear workshop brand products produced and sold by third parties 
these agreements generated revenue of million in  million in and million in wholesale revenue is primarily generated under agreements with third parties who operate build a bear workshop locations or sell our product in agreed upon outlets 
these agreements generated revenue of million in  million in and million in in addition to our normal wholesale business  in  we had two wholesale transactions totaling million with no gross margin 
international franchise revenue our first franchisee location was opened in november the number of international  franchised stores opened and closed for the periods presented below can be summarized as follows fiscal year beginning of period opened closed end of period as of december   we had master franchise agreements  which typically grant franchise rights for a particular country or group of countries  covering an aggregate of countries 
in the ordinary course of business  we anticipate signing additional master franchise agreements in the future and terminating other such agreements 
we expect our current franchisees to open eight to twelve stores in fiscal we believe there is a market potential for approximately international stores outside of the united states  canada  the united kingdom and ireland  which we expect to be operated primarily by new and existing franchisees 
results of operations overview while fiscal was a challenging year  with an overall decline in comparable store sales  significant impairment charges and a decline in store contribution  we made significant progress on our strategic objectives 
we announced our plans to close to stores by the end of and introduced our innovative new store design and reintroduced brand building national television advertising in the united states 
in the fourth quarter  we began to see indications that our strategic plans were having the desired impact our first six stores in the new design exceeded sales expectations  increasing an average of  the ten stores that were closed in transferred an average of of sales to other stores in the same market  the television marketing that began in mid october  contributed to a significant improvement in the sales trend in north america  with fourth quarter comparable store sales increasing  the gift of experience message in our ad campaigns also drove a increase in gift card sales in the peak fourth quarter gifting season 
we expect to see the benefit of these redemptions in  and we achieved cost savings of million in which we used to support sales driving marketing initiatives and to offset product cost increases 
fiscal will be a year of significant transition as we expect to hire a new chief executive bear and execute significant real estate strategy with the closure of approximately to stores and the remodeling or relocation of approximately stores in our new design

store contribution consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation  amortization and impairment  goodwill impairment  general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our web store and seasonal and event based locations 
this term  as we define it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we use store contribution as a measure of our stores operating performance 
store contribution should not be considered a substitute for net income loss  net income loss per store  cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows provided by operating activities per store  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
we believe store contribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it  along with the number of stores in operation  directly impacts our profitability

as a toy retailer  our sales are highest in our fourth quarter  followed by the first quarter 
the timing of holidays and school vacations can impact our quarterly results 
our european based stores have historically been more heavily weighted in the fourth quarter as compared to our north american stores 
we cannot ensure that this will continue to be the case 
our operating results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods  and may fluctuate significantly because of a variety of factors  including those discussed under risk factors risks related to owning our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to substantially decline 
the timing of permanent store closures and temporary closures for remodels and relocations may result in fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of the revenues and expenses associated with each store location 
we typically incur most preopening costs for a store in the three months immediately preceding the store s opening or reopening 
we also incur costs to close stores  typically in the three to six months prior to the closure 
for accounting purposes  the quarters of each fiscal year consist of weeks  although we will have a week quarter approximately once every six years 
the fiscal fourth quarter was a week quarter 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the opening of new stores  installation and upgrades of information systems and working capital 
over the past several years  we have met these requirements through capital generated from cash flow provided by operations 
we have access to additional cash through a revolving line of credit that has been in place since operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal and million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flows from operating activities decreased in fiscal as compared to  primarily due to decreased store contribution

no employee stock options were exercised in fiscal capital resources 
as of december   we had a cash balance of million  nearly half of which was domiciled outside of the united states 
we also have a line of credit  which we can use to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs throughout the year 
the credit agreement is with us bank national association 
on december   we amended the existing bank line of credit that now provides borrowing capacity of million 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by our assets and a pledge of of our ownership interest in our foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement expires on december  and contains various restrictions on indebtedness  liens  guarantees  redemptions  mergers  acquisitions or sale of assets  loans  transactions with affiliates  and investments 
it prohibits us from declaring dividends without the bank s prior consent  unless such payment of dividends would not violate any terms of the credit agreement 
we are also prohibited from repurchasing shares of our common stock unless such purchase would not violate any terms of the credit agreement  we may not use proceeds of the line of credit to repurchase shares 
borrowings bear interest at libor plus 
financial covenants include maintaining a minimum tangible net worth  maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement and not exceeding a maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization ratio 
on february   we amended our existing bank line of credit to reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio for the fiscal year ending december   returning to its previous requirement thereafter 
as of december  i we were in compliance with these covenants  ii there were no borrowings under our line of credit  and iii there was a standby letter of credit of approximately million outstanding under the credit agreement 
giving effect to this standby letter of credit  there was approximately million available for borrowing under the line of credit 
most of our retail stores are located within shopping malls and all are operated under leases classified as operating leases 
our leases in north america typically have a ten year term and contain provisions for base rent plus percentage rent based on defined sales levels 
many of the leases contain a provision whereby either we or the landlord may terminate the lease after a certain time  typically in the third or fourth year and sixth or seventh year of the lease  if a certain minimum sales volume is not achieved 
many leases contain incentives to help defray the cost of construction of a new store 
typically  a portion of the incentive must be repaid to the landlord if we choose to terminate the lease 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change of control of our company 
our leases also subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters  including rights of termination in some cases 
our leases in the united kingdom and ireland typically have terms of ten to fifteen years and generally contain a provision whereby every fifth year the rental rate can be adjusted to reflect the current market rates 
the leases typically provide the lessee with the first right for renewal at the end of the lease 
we may also be required to make deposits and rent guarantees to secure new leases as we expand 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change of control of our company 
real estate taxes also change according to government time schedules to reflect current market rental rates for the locations we lease 
rents are charged quarterly and paid in advance 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures 
capital spending in fiscal totaled million 
capital spending in fiscal was primarily for continued installation and upgrades of central office information technology systems  the opening of five new stores  the remodeling or relocation of stores 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a million share repurchase program of our outstanding common stock 
on march   we announced an expansion of our share repurchase program to million 
on february   we announced that our share repurchase program had been extended to march  we currently intend to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock in the open market including through b plans  through privately negotiated transactions or through an accelerated repurchase transaction 
as of march   approximately million shares at an average price of per share have been repurchased under this program for an aggregate amount of million  leaving million of availability under the program 
the primary source of funding for the program has been  and is expected to be  cash on hand 
the timing and amount of additional share repurchases  if any  will depend on price  market conditions  applicable regulatory requirements  and other factors 
the program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
shares repurchased under the program have been  and will continue to be  subsequently retired 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash flow requirements for the near future 
our credit agreement expires on december  off balance sheet arrangements we hold a minority interest in ridemakerz  llc  which is accounted for under the equity method 
ridemakerz has developed a wholesale toy product line and selectively operates interactive retail stores  primarily in tourist locations that allow children and families to build and customize their own personalized cars 
in  we purchased a call option from a group of other ridemakerz investors for  for million ridemakerz common units at an exercise price of per unit

see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on an average cost basis 
historically  we have not conducted sales whereby we offer products below cost and  accordingly  have no significant lower of cost or market reserve recorded 
throughout the year we record an estimated cost of shortage based on past experience 
the amount accrued for shortage each period is based on detailed historical averages 
the accrual rate remained unchanged for fiscal  and periodic physical inventories are taken and any difference between the actual physical count of merchandise and the recorded amount in our records are adjusted and recorded as shortage 
historically  including fiscal years  and  the timing of the physical inventory has been in the fourth quarter so that no material amount of shortage was required to be estimated on activity between the date of the physical count and year end 
however  future physical counts of merchandise may not be at times at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year end  and our estimate of shortage for the intervening period may be material based on the amount of time between the date of the physical inventory and the date of the fiscal quarter or year end 
long lived assets in accordance with asc section we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset  or asset group  to expected future net cash flows generated by the asset  or asset group 
if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount is compared to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference 
for purposes of evaluating store assets for impairment  we have determined that each store location is an asset group 
as of december   store assets represented approximately million  or approximately of total property  plant and equipment  net 
factors that we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant changes in our business strategies and or negative industry or economic trends 
we assess events and changes in circumstances or strategy that could potentially indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable as they occur 
due to the significance of the fourth quarter to individual store locations  we assess store performance annually  using the full year s results 
we consider a historical and or projected negative cash flow trend for a store location to be an indicator that the carrying value of that asset group may not be recoverable 
as a result of our review  we determined that certain stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the asset group  future growth rate and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value assumptions on store asset impairment  we applied a hypothetical decrease of in the comparable stores sales trend and in margin  which we believe is appropriate 
based on the analysis performed as of december   the changes in our assumptions would have resulted in additional impairment charges of approximately million 
as a result of our reviews in and  we determined that certain stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group and recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in the fourth quarters of fiscal and  respectively  which are included in cost of merchandise sold 
in  we made the decision to close a number of stores 
we consider a more likely than not assessment that an individual location will close as a triggering event to review the store asset group for recoverability 
these assessments are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
as a result of these reviews  it was determined that certain stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the shortened remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  the carrying value of the assets was reduced to fair value  calculated as the estimated future cash flows for each asset group  and asset impairment charges of million were recorded in fiscal  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses as a component of net loss before income taxes in the retail segment 
the inputs used to determine the fair value of the assets are level inputs as defined by asc section as of december   the remaining net book value related to these stores was approximately million 
in the event that we decide to close any or all of these stores in the future  we may be required to record additional impairments  lease termination fees  severance and other charges 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different than historical results 
as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in further impairment charges in future periods 
corporate assets  including computer hardware and software and the company owned distribution center approximately million as of december   and certain other assets  such as trademarks and intellectual property  net approximately million as of december   have a broad applicability and are generally considered to be recoverable  unless abandoned 
other long lived assets  including deferred franchise and lease costs approximately million as of december   are monitored in relation to the relevant franchisee or store location 
at december   we evaluated our trade credits asset and determined that certain assumptions regarding future utilization were no longer attainable 
accordingly  an impairment review was performed 
based on current utilization expectations  we determined that the full value of the asset was not recoverable 
accordingly  the carrying value of the trade credits was reduced to fair value  calculated as the expected present value of estimated future utilization 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses as a component of net loss before income taxes in the commercial segment 
the inputs used to determine the fair value of the asset are level inputs as defined by asc as of december   million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million was included in other assets  net  related to these credits 
goodwill we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired 
all of our recorded goodwill  which is associated with our acquisition of our operations in the united kingdom  is recorded in the european reporting unit 
goodwill is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment when circumstances warrant  or at least once per year 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment is tested in accordance with asc section  by comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value and a reconciliation of the fair value to our overall market capitalization 
as there are not quoted prices for our reporting unit  fair value is estimated based upon a present value technique using estimated discounted future cash flows  forecasted over the reasonably assured lease terms for retail stores  with growth rates forecasted for the reporting unit and using a credit adjusted discount rate 
we use current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors as the basis for expected future cash flows 
additionally  we are required to reconcile the fair value of the reporting unit to our overall market capitalization 
in  we performed our annual evaluation of our goodwill as of december  as a result of the sustained decline in the market price of our common stock  coupled with the decline in the performance of the uk reporting unit  we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit  estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and reconciled to our market capitalization  was less than its carrying value 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge for the entire balance of goodwill in the fourth quarter 
this does not change our long term outlook for the uk reporting unit 
revenue recognition revenues from retail sales  net of discounts and excluding sales tax  are recognized at the time of sale 
guest returns have not been significant 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
unredeemed gift cards are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a customer loyalty program  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar 
points accumulate and expire after months of inactivity 
in north america  guests receive a coupon for free merchandise after reaching points and a reward certificate after reaching points 
additional awards are earned for each additional points earned in the month period 
in the uk  guests receive a certificate for every points they earn 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption patterns  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of awards 
we review redemption patterns and assess the adequacy of the deferred revenue liability at the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the estimates involved in these assessments  adjustments to the historical rates are generally made no more often than annually in order to allow time for more definite trends to emerge 
based on this assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue liability was adjusted downward by million  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million decrease in net loss 
based on this assessment at the end of fiscal and  the deferred revenue liability was adjusted downward by million and million  respectively  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million and million decrease in net loss  respectively 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  specifically  expected conversion and redemption rates 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the recognition of deferred revenue  we applied a hypothetical increase of bps in the conversion and redemption rates which we believe is appropriate 
based on the analysis performed as of december   the change in our assumptions would have resulted in a million reduction of net retail sales 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we performed an analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  consistent with the provisions of asc in the fiscal and fourth quarters  the company recorded a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
the charge related to deferred tax assets in the uk and canada  while the charge related the deferred tax assets in the united states 
this allowance does not preclude us from utilizing the deferred tax assets in the future  nor does it reflect a change in our long term outlook 
recent accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements that are expected to significantly impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows can be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
we had no borrowings during fiscal accordingly  a basis point change in interest rates would result in no material change to our annual interest expense 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we conduct operations in various countries  which expose us to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries and franchisees may be materially impacted by exposure to fluctuating exchange rates 
reported sales  costs and expenses at our foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on reported revenues  costs and expenses  and earnings  this impact is principally the result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
although we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us  these obligations are settled primarily in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks for our purchase obligations 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes
