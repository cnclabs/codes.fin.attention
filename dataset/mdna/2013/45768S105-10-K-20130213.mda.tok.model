item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
executive overview our business performance in was against a background of continued weakness in european demand due to the on going economic difficulties  especially in southern european countries 
demand in other developed markets continued to show slow growth  while enhanced demand for fuel and personal care products in emerging markets boosted prospects in south america and asia pacific 
although global fuel demand was relatively weak  the major weakness was in gasoline demand in the developed markets of europe and north america  driven mainly by a significant improvement in vehicle fuel economy 
diesel demand  however  was stronger  supported by global commercial fleet demand  and passenger car demand in europe 
there was limited new legislation in the developed markets  with a slow roll out of sulfur and biofuel legislation in other markets 
strong demand from the oil and gas sector  notably in north america  provided a positive environment for our nascent oilfield specialties business  while consumer demand for contaminant free and natural renewable cosmetic ingredients provides a driver for new technology in personal care 
economic difficulties in the european markets have driven softer demand for our polymers business 
we have managed our investments in capital equipment  working capital and recruitment of additional skilled personnel in line with these market factors 
our capital program and expenses during included investment in a new information system platform  which we expect to add value to our business in during  we completed the acquisition of strata control services  inc strata to help build out our presence in oilfield specialties  and we continue to seek further opportunities for this area in we also made a non binding offer for the tpc group  and later withdrew this offer as we felt that we could not derive sufficient shareholder value from the deal 
this aborted transaction resulted in a million charge for acquisition related costs in the fourth quarter 
we also instituted a one time special dividend of per share  which was paid on december  to shareholders of record on december  critical accounting estimates note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims 
the company discloses information concerning contingent liabilities in respect of these claims and proceedings for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote and the potential loss could materially 
table of contents impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we recognize within selling  general and administrative expenses liabilities for these claims and proceedings when it is probable that the company has incurred a loss based on an unfavorable outcome and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and we endeavor to fairly present  in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our consolidated financial statements  management s view of our exposure 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel as appropriate to assess probability and estimates of loss 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recognized liability will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum amount of the range will be recognized 
we re evaluate our assessments each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available 
the actual cost of ultimately resolving a claim or proceeding may be significantly different from the amount of the recognized liability 
in addition  because it is not permissible to recognize a liability until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to recognize a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
environmental liabilities remediation provisions at december  amounted to million and relate principally to our ellesmere port site in the united kingdom 
we recognize environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated  and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future expected costs  and comply with environmental legislation in the countries in which it operates or has operated in 
the company views the costs of vacating our ellesmere port site as contingent upon if and when it vacates the site because there is no present intention to do so 
the company has further determined that  due to the uncertain product life of tel particularly in the market for aviation gasoline and other products being manufactured on site  there are uncertainties as to the probability and timing of the expected costs 
such uncertainties have been considered in estimating the provision 
pensions the company maintains a defined benefit pension plan covering a number of its current and former employees in the united kingdom 
the company also has other much smaller pension arrangements in the us and overseas  but the obligations under those plans are not material 
the united kingdom plan is closed to future service accrual  but has a large number of deferred and current pensioners 
movements in the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation pbo are dependent on actual return on investments as well as our assumptions in respect of the discount rate  annual member mortality rates  future return on assets and future inflation 
a 
table of contents change in any one of these assumptions could impact the plan asset value  pbo and pension charge recognized in the income statement 
such changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
for example  a change in the discount rate assumption would change the pbo by approximately million and the net pension charge for by approximately million 
a change in the level of price inflation assumption would change the pbo by approximately million and the net pension charge for by approximately million 
further information is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax and uncertain income tax positions at december   no valuation allowance is required against our foreign tax credit carry forwards within deferred tax as management believes that all the foreign tax credit carry forwards can be utilized in future periods prior to their expiration 
no deferred taxes have been provided for the unremitted earnings of our overseas subsidiaries as any tax basis differences relating to investments in these overseas subsidiaries are considered to be permanent in duration 
we have no current intention to repatriate past or future earnings of our overseas subsidiaries and consider that these earnings have been reinvested overseas 
if circumstances were to change that would cause these earnings to be repatriated an additional us tax liability could be incurred  and we continue to monitor this position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained  based on technical merits  when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent that we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement may require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the company s reporting units  the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment  are consistent with the reportable segments fuel specialties  performance chemicals and octane additives 
the components in each segment including products  markets and competitors 
table of contents have similar economic characteristics and the segments  therefore  reflect the lowest level at which operations and cash flows can be sufficiently distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the company 
the company tests goodwill annually for impairment  or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
the company performs its annual goodwill tests in respect of fuel specialties and performance chemicals as at december each year 
in reviewing for any impairment charge the fair values of the reporting segments are estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on management s best available estimates at that time 
the key assumptions underpinning these calculations include future revenue growth  gross margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
at december  we had million and million of goodwill relating to our fuel specialties and performance chemicals segments  respectively 
our annual impairment tests as of such date indicated no impairment because the estimated fair values of those reporting segments substantially exceeded the carrying values 
in light of the continuing decline in the octane additives market globally  as the company makes sales of octane additives in each quarter  future remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the octane additives segment are being reduced  and accordingly the fair value of the octane additives segment is also reduced 
as a result  the company determined that quarterly impairment tests should be performed from january  and any impairment charge arising be recognized in the relevant quarter 
as a result of the octane additives impairment tests performed during  and impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  have been recognized 
these charges are non cash in nature and have no impact on taxation 
in some of the assumptions and estimates relating to the octane additives segment discounted cash flows were revised as part of our planning processes although the overall methodology was unchanged 
these revisions had no material impact on the reporting of goodwill 
there was million of goodwill remaining at december  which relates to the octane additives segment and equates to the fair value of the goodwill at that date 
given the amount and predictability of the remaining future cash flows from the octane additives segment the company expects goodwill impairment charges to be recognized in the income statement on an approximate straight line basis to december  however  since the remaining sales of the octane additives segment are concentrated around a relatively small number of customers  there is a risk that they could dramatically decline resulting in an accelerated impairment of the octane additives segment goodwill as the forecast discounted cash flows from that segment would be reduced 
while we believe our assumptions for impairment tests are reasonable  they are subjective judgments  and it is possible that variations in any of the assumptions may result in materially different calculations of impairment charges  if any 

table of contents other intangible assets net of amortization and property  plant and equipment at december  we had million of other intangible assets net of amortization  and million of property  plant and equipment  that are discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  respectively 
these long lived assets relate to all of our reporting segments and are being amortized or depreciated straight line over periods of up to years in respect of the other intangible assets and up to years in respect of the property  plant and equipment 
we continually assess the markets and products related to these long lived assets  as well as their specific carrying values  and have concluded that these carrying values  and amortization and depreciation periods  remain appropriate 
we also test these long lived assets for any potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
these types of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to introduction of new products with enhanced features by our competitors  loss of  material reduction in purchases by  or non renewal of a contract by  a significant customer  prolonged decline in business or consumer spending  sharp and unexpected rise in raw material  chemical or energy costs  and new laws or regulations inhibiting the development  manufacture  distribution or sale of our products 
in order to facilitate this testing the company groups together assets at the lowest possible level for which cash flow information is available 
undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the asset groups are compared with the carrying value of the assets and  if such cash flows are lower  an impairment loss may be recognized 
the amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
fair values are determined using post tax cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
if events occur or circumstances change it may cause a reduction in periods over which these long lived assets are amortized or depreciated  or result in a non cash impairment of a portion of their carrying value 
a reduction in amortization or depreciation periods would have no effect on cash flows 
we are continuing with the implementation of a new  company wide  information system platform 
the platform provider is well established in the market 
the implementation will be a phased  risk managed  site deployment and follow a multistage user acceptance program with the existing platform providing a fallback position 
internally developed software and other costs capitalized at december  were million million 
no amortization was recognized in million

trade receivables in our octane additives segment are primarily driven by the timing of shipments to major customers  and the associated sales terms of those shipments  of which there was a significant shipment in both december and and accordingly trade and other accounts receivable in that segment were largely unchanged 

table of contents the million increase in inventories was focused in our performance chemicals segment following the decision to build certain product inventories of strategic importance  and to facilitate the sales growth achieved during the fourth quarter and anticipated sales growth in days sales in inventory in our fuel specialties segment declined from days as at december  to days as at december  however  days sales in inventory in our performance chemicals segment increased substantially over the same period from days to days as we built inventories 
prepaid expenses increased marginally from million to million 
the moderate million decrease in accounts payable and the current portion of accrued liabilities was primarily due to payments made in to the government authorities 
outside of those payments  accounts payable and the current portion of accrued liabilities in each of our reporting segments as at december  and  were largely unchanged except for performance chemicals for which creditor days increased from days to days and absolute level of accounts payable and the current portion of accrued liabilities increased in line with production and inventories 
operating cash flows we generated cash from operating activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to of million was primarily due to our increased profitability rather than trading levels  as net income increased by million from million to million 
in addition  in we benefited from more stable working capital levels compared to in our working capital requirements increased by million in order to support the substantially increased trading levels when net sales increased by  or million  from million to million 
in net sales increased by  or million  from million to million 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to of million was primarily due to the million paid in cash in september in settlement of the newmarket corporation civil complaint 
cash at december  and we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were held by non us subsidiaries principally in the united kingdom 
the company is in a position to control whether or not to repatriate foreign earnings and intends to reinvest earnings to fund overseas subsidiaries 
we currently do not expect to make a further repatriation in the foreseeable future and hence have not provided for future income taxes on the cash held by overseas subsidiaries 
if circumstances were to change that would cause these earnings to be repatriated an additional us tax liability could be incurred  and we continue to monitor this position 
short term investments at december  and we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 

table of contents debt on december   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million 
the credit facility carries an interest rate based on us libor plus a margin of between and which is dependent on the company s ratio of net debt to ebitda 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of liquidity defined in the credit facility 
the credit facility can be drawn down until it expires on december  and may be drawn down in full in the us 
the current credit facility contains restrictions which may limit our activities  and operational and financial flexibility 
we may not be able to borrow if an event of default is outstanding  which includes a material adverse change to our assets  operations or financial condition 
the credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability  among other things  and subject to certain limited exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pledge our assets as security  guarantee obligations of third parties  make investments  effect a merger or consolidation  dispose of assets  or materially change our line of business 
in addition  the credit facility contains terms which  if breached  would result in it becoming repayable on demand 
it requires  among other matters  compliance with the following financial covenant ratios measured on a quarterly basis our ratio of net debt to ebitda must not be greater than and our ratio of ebitda to net interest must not be less than management has determined that the company has not breached these covenants throughout the period to december  and expects to not breach these covenants for the next months 
the credit facility is secured by a number of fixed and floating charges over certain assets which include key operating sites of the company and its subsidiaries 
as at december   we had million of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of our september  settlement with newmarket corporation  we issued a million promissory note to newmarket corporation payable in three equal annual installments carrying simple interest at per annum 
the first installment was paid on september  the debt maturity profile as at december  is set out below in millions current portion of long term debt long term debt  net of current portion 
table of contents outlook at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and debt of million resulting in net debt of million

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses floating rate debt to finance its global operations 
the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the countries in which the company s largest operations are located 
credit limits  ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk 
collateral is not generally required 
the company uses derivatives  including interest rate swaps  commodity swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in the normal course of business to manage market risks 
the derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  the company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage the exposure to non performance of such instruments 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with such changes 
the company offers fixed prices for some long term sales contracts 
as manufacturing and raw material costs are subject to variability the company uses commodity swaps to hedge the cost of some raw materials thus reducing volatility on earnings and cash flows 
the derivatives are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
the company s objective is to manage its exposure to fluctuating costs of raw materials 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
as at december  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  no bank overdraft and long term debt of million including current portion 
long term debt comprises a revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million and a million promissory note to newmarket corporation 
the credit facility carries an interest rate based on us libor plus a margin of between and which is dependent on the company s ratio of net debt to ebitda 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of liquidity defined in the credit facility 
the promissory note carries simple interest at per annum 
at december   million was drawn under the revolving credit facility 
as management does not expect the credit facility to be drawn down in the long term  the company has not entered into interest rate swap agreements in relation to this 
on the basis that interest on million of the million long term debt including current portion is fixed and that the company would receive interest on the million positive cash balances and short term investments  then the interest payable on variable debt excluding the margin is more than offset by the interest receivable on positive cash balances 
table of contents and short term investments 
on a gross basis  assuming no additional interest on the cash balances and short term investments  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates on the variable debt of million for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
on a net basis  assuming additional interest on the cash balances and short term investments  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
the above does not consider the effect of interest or exchange rate changes on overall activity nor management action to mitigate such changes 
exchange rate risk the company generates an element of its revenues and incurs some operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company evaluates the functional currency of each reporting unit according to the economic environment in which it operates 
several major subsidiaries of the company operating outside of the us have the us dollar as their functional currency due to the nature of the markets in which they operate 
in addition  the financial position and results of operations of some of our overseas subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling and swiss franc 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities  to the extent that such figures reflect the inclusion of foreign assets and liabilities which are translated into us dollars for presentation in our consolidated financial statements  as well as our results of operations 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the us dollar value of its existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments  and cash flows 
the company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company s exposure to certain foreign currency denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar value of the related foreign currency denominated revenues 
the objective of the hedging program is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the trading of our fuel specialties and performance chemicals reporting segments is inherently naturally hedged and accordingly changes in exchange rates would not be material to our earnings or financial position 
the cost base of our octane additives reporting segment 
table of contents and corporate costs  however  are largely denominated in british pound sterling 
a strengthening in the us dollar against british pound sterling would increase reported operating income by approximately million for a one year period excluding the impact of any foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
where a strengthening of the us dollar has been used as an illustration  a weakening would be expected to have the opposite effect on operating income 
raw material cost risk we use a variety of raw materials  chemicals and energy in our manufacturing and blending processes 
many of the raw materials that we use are derived from petrochemical based feedstocks which can be subject to periods of rapid and significant cost instability 
these fluctuations in cost can be caused by political instability in oil producing nations and elsewhere  or other factors influencing global supply and demand of these materials  over which we have no or little control 
we use long term contracts generally with fixed or formula based costs and advance bulk purchases to help ensure availability and continuity of supply  and to manage the risk of cost increases 
we have entered into hedging arrangements for certain raw materials  but do not typically enter into hedging arrangements for all raw materials  chemicals or energy costs 
should the costs of raw materials  chemicals or energy increase  and should we not be able to pass on these cost increases to our customers  then operating margins and cash flows from operating activities would be adversely impacted 
should raw material costs increase significantly  then the company s need for working capital could similarly increase 
any of these risks could adversely impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows
