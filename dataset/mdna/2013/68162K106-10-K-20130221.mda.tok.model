item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading metals service center that operates in two reportable segments  flat products and tubular and pipe products 
we provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers 
our primary flat products focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated  aluminum and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
commencing with the july  acquisition of chicago tube and iron company  or cti  we distribute metal tubing  pipe  bar  valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets 
products that require more value added processing generally have a higher gross profit 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the demand for and availability of metals  and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned metals 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
international sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to general and global business  economic  financial  banking and political conditions  competition  metals pricing  demand and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals  inventory held in the supply chain  customers ability to manage their credit line availability  and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers  competitors and end use customers 
like other service centers  we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts  historic buying practices  supply agreements with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
when metals prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when metals prices decline  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower gross profits as we sell existing metals inventory 
chicago tube and iron company acquisition on july   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of cti  pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated may  cti stocks  processes and fabricates metal tubing  pipe  bar  valves and fittings and pressure parts at nine operating facilities located primarily throughout the midwestern united states 
the acquisition of cti enhances our commercial opportunities by adding new product offerings to an expanded customer base and by increasing our distribution footprint 
reportable segments as a result of our acquisition of cti  we now operate in two reportable segments  flat products and tubular and pipe products 
the company evaluated its reportable segments in connection with its acquisition of cti  and followed the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach to define and report the financial results of operating segments 
the management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the company s chief operating decision maker codm to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions 
our codm evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income loss 
our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting 
flat products the primary focus of our flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated  aluminum and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations 
we serve customers in most metals consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation equipment  automobiles  food service and electrical equipment  military vehicles and equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
the flat products segment has strategically located processing and distribution facilities in the united states and one in monterrey  mexico 
this geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
tubular and pipe products the tubular and pipe products segment consists of the recently acquired cti business 
through our tubular and pipe products segment  we distribute metals tubing  pipe  bar  valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets 
founded in  cti operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern united states 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force

effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased metals  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of metals and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation flat product segments inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased metals  internal and external processing and inbound freight 
costs of our flat product segment s inventories  including flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products are determined using the specific identification method 
as a result of the acquisition of cti  certain of our tubular metals products inventory is stated under the last in  first out  or lifo  method  which is not in excess of market 
at december   approximately million  or of consolidated inventory  was reported under the lifo method of accounting 
the cost of the remainder of cti s inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first in  first out method 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for our southern region  integrity stainless and cti operations and indefinite lived intangible assets for our cti operation in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment 
events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
we estimate the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology  an income approach  and a publicly traded companies guideline method  a market approach 
management s assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results  projected financial information and recent economic events 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
due to the impairment of the southern region s goodwill  a triggering event occurred for the long lived assets of the southern region 
we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis which indicated that there were no indicators of impairment of the long lived assets of the southern region 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
revenue recognition for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred  which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
the engineered products produced by cti typically take several months to produce due to their size and complexity 
substantially all projects are completed within six months 
the company may request advance payments from customers during the production of these products 
these payments are included in current short term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to their short term nature  the company uses the units of delivery method to account for these contracts 
revenue for the contracts is recognized when the product is shipped and title of the product transfers to the customers 
revenue for these engineered products accounted for less than of our net sales during and for approximately of our net sales during purchase price accounting business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires us to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we use valuation specialists  where necessary  to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions that are critical in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update  or asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu related to the presentation of comprehensive income in consolidated financial statements 
the new accounting guidance requires the presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement  or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the accounting standard eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income and its components as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
this standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods 
we adopted this standard during and the adoption had no material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu intends to align impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
this asu allows the assessment based on qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired prior to determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other general intangibles other than goodwill 
the provisions of this asu are required to be applied to the interim and annual tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we adopted this standard during and the adoption had no material impact to our financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 
 other comprehensive income 
this asu intends to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income by requiring an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the provisions of this asu will be applied to the interim and annual tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect asu to have a material impact on our financial statements during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal raw materials are carbon  coated and stainless steel  and aluminum  pipe and tube  flat rolled sheet  coil and plate that we typically purchase from multiple primary metals producers 
the metals industry as a whole is cyclical and  at times  pricing and availability of metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including general domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  sales levels  competition  levels of inventory held by other metals service centers  consolidation of metals producers  new global capacity by metals producers  higher raw material costs for the producers of metals  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us 
we  like many other metals service centers  maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices  supply agreements with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
we have no long term  fixed price metals purchase contracts 
when metals prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when metals prices decline  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower gross profits and inventory lower of cost or market adjustments as we sell existing inventory 
significant or rapid declines in metals prices or reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facility  as well as result in us incurring inventory or goodwill impairment charges 
changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our net sales  gross profits  operating income and net income 
rising prices result in higher working capital requirements for us and our customers 
some customers may not have sufficient credit lines or liquidity to absorb significant increases in the price of metals 
while we have generally been successful in the past in passing on producers price increases and surcharges to our customers  there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass on price increases to our customers in the future 
declining metals prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income  while increasing metals prices  have generally favorably affected our net sales and net income 
approximately of our consolidated net sales in were directly to automotive manufacturers or manufacturers of automotive components and parts 
historically  due to the concentration of customers in the automotive industry  our gross profits on these sales have generally been less than our profits on sales to customers in other industries 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past two years 
we are exposed to the impact of fluctuating metals prices and interest rate changes 
during and  we entered into nickel swaps at the request of customers 
while these derivatives are intended to be effective in helping us manage risk  they have not been designated as hedging instruments 
for certain customers  we enter into contractual relationships that entitle us to pass through the economic effect of trading positions that we take with other third parties on our customers behalf 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
if interest rates in the future were to increase basis points from december  rates and  assuming no change in total debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to us would be approximately million 
we have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate libor loans under the abl credit facility 
the company assumed an interest rate swap agreement on the million of cti irb 
the swap agreement matures in april  but may be reduced annually by the amount of the optional principal payments on the irb 
in june  the company entered into a forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge commencing july in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on approximately million of the outstanding libor based borrowings under the abl credit facility 
the hedge matures on june  and is reduced monthly by the principal payments on the term loan 
the fixed rate interest rate hedge is accounted for as a cash flow hedging instrument for accounting purposes 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap and fixed interest rate hedge agreements 
however  the company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties
