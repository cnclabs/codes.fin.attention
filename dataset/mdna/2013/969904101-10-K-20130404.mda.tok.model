occupancy expenses consist of rent  depreciation and other occupancy costs  including common area maintenance and utilities 
shipping costs consist of third party delivery services and shipping materials 
our classification of expenses in cost of goods sold may not be comparable to other public companies  as we do not include non occupancy related costs associated with our distribution network in cost of goods sold 
these costs  which include distribution network employment  third party warehouse management and other distribution related administrative expenses  are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
within our reportable segments  the direct to customer channel does not incur freight to store or store occupancy expenses  and typically operates with lower markdowns and inventory shrinkage than the retail channel 
however  the direct to customer channel incurs higher customer shipping  damage and replacement costs than the retail channel

these costs include employment  advertising  third party credit card processing and other general expenses 
we experience differing employment and advertising costs as a percentage of net revenues within the retail and direct to customer channels due to their distinct distribution and marketing strategies

income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal over fiscal was primarily driven by certain favorable income tax resolutions and credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of february   we held  in cash and cash equivalent funds  the majority of which are held in money market funds and highly liquid us treasury bills 
as is consistent within our industry  our cash balances are seasonal in nature  with the fourth quarter historically representing a significantly higher level of cash than other periods 
throughout the fiscal year  we utilize our cash balances to build our inventory levels in preparation for our fourth quarter holiday sales 
in fiscal  we plan to use our cash resources to fund our inventory and inventory related purchases  advertising and marketing initiatives  stock repurchases and dividend payments and purchases of property and equipment 
in addition to the current cash balances on hand  we have a credit facility that provides for a  unsecured revolving line of credit that may be used for loans or letters of credit 
prior to december   we may  upon notice to the lenders  request an increase in the credit facility of up to  to provide for a total of  of unsecured revolving credit 
during fiscal and fiscal  we had no borrowings under the credit facility  and no amounts were outstanding as of february  or january  however  as of february    in issued but undrawn standby letters of credit was outstanding under the credit facility 
additionally  as of february   we had three unsecured letter of credit reimbursement facilities for a total of  of which an aggregate of  was outstanding 
these letter of credit facilities represent only a future commitment to fund inventory purchases to which we had not taken legal title 
we are currently in compliance with all of our financial covenants and  based on our current projections  we expect to remain in compliance throughout fiscal we believe our cash on hand  in addition to our available credit facilities  will provide adequate liquidity for our business operations over the next months

other contractual obligations we have other liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
the timing of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in fiscal  which are included in our current liabilities as of february  we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts  we may provide certain routine indemnification relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
commercial commitments the following table provides summary information concerning our outstanding commercial commitments as of february  amount of outstanding commitment expiration by period dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal thereafter total letter of credit facilities standby letters of credit credit facility total see note c to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our borrowing arrangements 

table of contents impact of inflation the impact of inflation or deflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
in light of the recent economic environment  however  we cannot be certain of the effect inflation or deflation may have on our results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include significant estimates and assumptions 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
to determine if the value of our inventory should be marked down below cost  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences and age of the merchandise 
the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence including excess and slow moving inventory and lower of cost or market reserves and estimates of inventory shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends  aging reports  specific identification and our estimates of future retail sales and selling prices 
reserves for shrinkage are estimated and recorded throughout the year  at the concept and channel level  as a percentage of net sales based on historical shrinkage results  expectations of future shrinkage and current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  distribution centers  off site storage locations  and with our third party transportation providers 
accordingly  there is no shrinkage reserve at year end 
due to these factors  our obsolescence and shrinkage reserves contain uncertainties 
both estimates include calculations that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
if actual obsolescence or shrinkage estimates change from our original estimate  we will adjust our reserves accordingly throughout the year 
management does not believe that changes in the assumptions used in these estimates would have a significant effect on our inventory balances 
we have made no material changes to our assumptions included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves throughout the year 
in addition  we do not believe a change in our inventory reserves would have a material effect on net earnings 
as of february  and january   our inventory obsolescence reserves were  and  respectively 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred  or upon the release of the initial advertisement  with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of estimated direct to customer revenues for the period to the total estimated direct to customer revenues over the life of the catalog on an 
table of contents individual catalog basis 
estimated direct to customer revenues over the life of the catalog are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment  primarily at a store level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment analyses determine whether projected cash flows from operations are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets 
impairment may result when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life 
for store impairment  our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the store lease term is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  gross margin  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation and the overall economics of the retail industry  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the asset s net carrying value and its fair value 
long lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk and that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing annually on the first day of the fourth quarter  or between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount 
the first step of the impairment test requires determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we use the income approach  whereby we estimate the fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant estimates and assumptions such as estimates for sales growth  gross margins  employment rates  inflation and future economic and market conditions 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including goodwill  is in excess of its fair value  goodwill may be impaired  and we must perform a second step of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value to determine the impairment charge  if any 
at february  and january   we had goodwill of  and  respectively  included in other assets  primarily related to our fiscal acquisition of rejuvenation 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in fiscal or fiscal self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and product and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims data 
self insurance reserves for employee health benefits  workers compensation and product 
table of contents and general liability claims were  and  as of february  and january   respectively  and are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other within our consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation arrangements by measuring and recognizing compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based awards using a fair value based method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of grant 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised  converted or cancelled 
the fair value of each stock based award is amortized over the requisite service period 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of our earnings 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include significant deterioration of the us and foreign markets  changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  including the devaluation of the us dollar  and the effects of uncertain economic forces which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of february   our line of credit facility was the only instrument we held with a variable interest rate which could  if drawn upon  subject us to risks associated with changes in that interest rate 
as of february   there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of february   our investments  made primarily in money market funds  interest bearing demand deposit accounts and highly liquid us treasury bills  are stated at cost and approximate their fair values 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these international purchase transactions were not significant to us during fiscal and fiscal since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in us dollars  however  a decline in the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations 
in addition  as of february   our retail stores in canada and our limited operations in asia  europe and australia  expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although these exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to us in the past  we intend to enter into foreign currency contracts beginning in fiscal to minimize the currency remeasurement risk associated with the transactions of our foreign subsidiaries 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal
