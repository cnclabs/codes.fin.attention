the company s borrowing arrangements other than the medium term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants  including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to total capitalization ratios 
as defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements  minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods

the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits 
as a large taxpayer  the company is under audit from time to time by the irs and other taxing authorities  and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year 
while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the million in unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  at december   is excluded from the preceding table

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in that footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 

table of contents sales recognition sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer  which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms 
sales are net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts  cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis 
accounts deemed uncollectible are written off  net of expected recoveries 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  including shrink reserves  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are included in cost of products sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level  and all of the company goodwill is assigned to the company reporting units 
for the company s annual impairment testing in  reporting units  which were referred to as the company global business units gbu  were one level below the operating segment level 
effective january   the company  as part of project renewal  implemented certain changes to its organizational structure that resulted in the consolidation of the company global business units gbu into nine  and  as a result  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing for the nine gbus 
acquired businesses  if any  including goodwill arising from such transactions  are integrated into the company existing reporting units 
as of july   the company had nine reporting units with total goodwill of billion 
four of the company nine reporting units accounted for over percent of the company total goodwill 
these four reporting units were as follows writing creative expression  commercial products  technology  and industrial products services 
the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process 
the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
for example  if macroeconomic factors  such as consumer demand and consumer confidence  deteriorate materially such that the company reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates  the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired 
other than the annual impairment test  the company determined that no tests of impairment were necessary during in the company goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value  impairment may be present 
estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded 
the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing  each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value 
for the company reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows  the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value 
the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company internal forecasting process 
to determine the ebitda multiple  the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses 
the company also evaluates the ebitda multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the ebitda multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the company market capitalization plus an equity 
table of contents control premium 
the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the company market value  with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company 
the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 
the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from to in using the ebitda multiples  the company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the company total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium 
the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit  including the reporting unit market position  brand awareness  gross and operating margins  and prospects for growth  among other factors 
after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units  no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used 
furthermore  the company equity market value at july  of approximately billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately billion 
for the impairment test as of july   if each reporting unit ebitda multiple were reduced by from the to multiple used for each reporting unit  all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances  such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned  is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market  has experienced significant losses  is in a stage of hyper growth  is executing significant restructuring efforts  or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies 
the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value the technology reporting unit for the annual impairment test as of july  the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit  the discount rate  long term sales growth rate  and the working capital investment required 
estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates  raw material and sourced product costs  currency fluctuations  and operating efficiencies to be realized 
the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit 
in using the discounted cash flow approach to value the technology reporting unit in  the company used an average compound long term sales growth rate of  average operating margins generally ranging from to  and a discount rate of 
the company concluded that the technology reporting unit passed step of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach 
if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the technology reporting unit increased basis points  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have declined by approximately million and would have resulted in a fair value  which was approximately less than the net assets of the reporting unit 
additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether the technology reporting unit goodwill was impaired  and to the extent goodwill was impaired  the magnitude of the impairment charge 
the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the technology reporting unit was approximately million as of july  the company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of the technology reporting unit 
the company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and are successful in improving the financial performance of the reporting unit 
to the extent the company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies  it is possible the company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with the technology reporting unit in future periods 
the technology reporting unit has been adversely affected by the decline in government spending and its impact on the classroom technology industry  as well as weaker macroeconomic conditions throughout western europe 
other than the technology reporting unit  the company has no reporting units whose estimated fair values at july  exceeded net assets by less than of the reporting unit net assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets the company indefinite lived intangible assets totaled million as of july  the company adopted accounting standards update asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
under asu  the company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
additionally  the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

table of contents in performing the qualitative assessment for each of the company indefinite lived intangible assets  the company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  including factors such as declines in actual or planned revenue or negative or declining cash flows  input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows  legal  regulatory  contractual  political  business or other factors  and  other entity specific events such as changes in management  key personnel  strategy or customers 
based on the qualitative assessment  if the company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset 
for the quantitative impairment test  the company estimates the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method  which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trade name 
an impairment charge for indefinite lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 
the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets as of july   and determined that none of its indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired 
the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date  such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name 
based on consideration of these factors  the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present  and therefore  impairment testing as of a date other than july  was not required during potential for future impairments as of december   the company had goodwill of billion and indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company customer base and net sales  a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers  or sustained declines in the company market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity 
the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors  which could result in impairment charges in the future 
although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur  if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels  it is reasonably likely the company will be required to record impairment charges in the future 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes costs associated with internal use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development 
capitalized internal use software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  ii payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project  and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software 
capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
the company expenses as incurred research and development  general and administrative  and indirect costs associated with internal use software 
in addition  the company expenses as incurred training  maintenance and other internal use software costs incurred during the post implementation stage 
costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 
the company capitalized million of software costs during  which primarily relate to employee  consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of sap in the european region and in brazil 
capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were million at december  capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december  the company amortizes internal use software costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  which typically ranges from to years 
capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment  including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used 
impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 
other long lived assets the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical 
table of contents condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company s strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  the company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
the company has product liability reserves of million as of december  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company  and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations  as well as contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance  comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability cercla and other matters which are estimated at present value 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december   ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate  which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance  the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries  as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 
the company s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken  which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
for uncertain tax positions  the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance  which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the company s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  as discussed below discount rates the company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
health care cost trend rate the company s health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data  near term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
expected return on plan assets the company s expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
the company s analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increases reflects the company s long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense

the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the life of each plan 
the net amount amortized to expense totaled million pretax in  and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future 
changes in actuarial assumptions  changes in discount rates  actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually
