item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is a summary of certain factors that management considers important in reviewing the company s results of operations  financial position  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table contains results of operations for fiscal years and and the dollar and percentage changes for those periods in thousands  except percentages 
change change net sales by category bedding  blankets and accessories bibs  bath and disposable products total net sales cost of products sold gross profit of net sales marketing and administrative expenses of net sales interest expense other income income tax expense net income of net sales net sales sales of million for were lower than  having decreased  or million 
the majority of the sales decrease was due to the transitioning away from an unprofitable private label bedding program in fiscal year and the shift of a modular program s shipment for a major customer from the first quarter of fiscal year into the fourth quarter of fiscal year sales were also affected by the continued sluggishness in the economy  which has prompted many of the company s customers to maintain a tight control over their inventories 
gross profit in spite of the decrease in sales from fiscal year to  gross profit increased in amount by  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase as a percentage of net sales can be attributed to lower production costs resulting from the redesign of several product lines to reduce the company s dependence on cotton  the cost of which had reached record setting levels in fiscal year the discontinuance of an unprofitable private label bedding program mentioned above also contributed to higher margins and countered the decline in sales 
the company s gross profit for fiscal year was also positively impacted by the decline in amortization costs related to the company s acquisition of the baby products line of springs global us on november   which were  lower than in fiscal year marketing and administrative expenses marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased in amount and as a percentage of net sales as compared with fiscal year primarily due to an increase of  in overall compensation costs  which was offset by a decrease of  in advertising costs 
interest expense and income interest expense decreased by  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to lower balances on the company s credit facility 
also  the company and its lender  cit group commercial services  inc cit  amended the company s financing agreement effective as of april  to provide for the payment by cit to the company of interest on daily cash balances held at cit at the rate of prime minus  which was during fiscal year the company earned  during fiscal year in interest income on its daily cash balances held at cit  compared with earning no interest income during fiscal year income tax expense the company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations decreased slightly to during fiscal year from in fiscal year the decline in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the current year in the amount of certain expenses that are deductible for tax purposes but not book purposes 
inflation the company has endeavored to increase its prices to offset inflationary increases in its raw materials and other costs  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining such price increases or in effecting such price increases in a manner that will provide a timely match to the cost increases 
known trends and uncertainties the company s financial results are closely tied to sales to the company s top three customers  which represented approximately of the company s gross sales in fiscal year a significant downturn experienced by any or all of these customers could lead to pressure on the company s revenues 
at times  the company has also faced higher raw material costs  primarily cotton  as well as increases in labor  transportation and currency costs associated with the company s sourcing activities in china 
increases in these costs could adversely affect the profitability of the company if it cannot pass the cost increases along to its customers in the form of price increases or if the timing of price increases does not closely match the cost increases  or if the company cannot further reduce its dependence on cotton 
for additional discussion of trends  uncertainties and other factors that could impact the company s operating results  see risk factors in item a 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities increased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended march  in the current year  the company experienced a greater increase in accrued liabilities  a lesser decrease in prepaid expenses and a lesser decrease in accounts receivable  which was offset by a greater reduction in inventory balances 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared with  in the prior year 
cash used in investing activities in the current year was primarily associated with capitalized costs of the company s internally developed intangible assets 
net cash used in financing activities increased from million to million in the current year as compared with the prior year 
cash used for the payment of dividends was higher in the current year  primarily associated with the payment of a special cash dividend during the current year of per share 
cash used in the prior year consisted primarily of million for net repayments on the company s revolving line of credit and the company s final payments on subordinated notes payable 
from april  to march   the company used the bulk of its net cash provided by operating activities for the payment of dividends  including a special cash dividend paid during the current year of per share 
the company s future performance is  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that its cash flow from operations and availability on its revolving line of credit will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs 
the company s credit facility at march  consisted of a revolving line of credit under a financing agreement with cit of up to million  which includes a million sub limit for letters of credit  with an interest rate of prime plus or libor plus 
the financing agreement matures on july  and is secured by a first lien on all assets of the company 
as of march   the company had elected to pay interest on balances owed under the revolving line of credit  if any  under the libor option 
the financing agreement also provides for the payment by cit to the company of interest at the rate of prime minus  which was at march   on daily negative balances held at cit 
under the financing agreement  a monthly fee is assessed based on of the average unused portion of the million revolving line of credit  less any outstanding letters of credit the commitment fee 
the commitment fee amounted to  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
at march   there was no balance owed on the revolving line of credit  there was no letter of credit outstanding and the company had million available under the revolving line of credit based on its eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the financing agreement was amended on may  to extend its maturity date to july  and to provide for certain other modifications  including  effective as of july   i a reduction of the interest rates on the revolving line of credit to prime minus or libor plus  ii a reduction of the commitment fee to of the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit and iii a reduction of the interest rate on daily cash balances held at cit to prime minus 
the financing agreement contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type  including limitations on other indebtedness  liens  transfers of assets  investments and acquisitions  merger or consolidation transactions  transactions with affiliates  and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of march  to reduce its exposure to credit losses  the company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to cit pursuant to factoring agreements  which have expiration dates that are coterminous with that of the financing agreement described above 
under the terms of the factoring agreements in effect prior to april   cit remitted payments to the company on the average due date of each group of invoices assigned 
if a customer failed to pay cit by the due date  the company was charged interest at prime plus  which was at april   until payment was received 
the company incurred interest expense of  in the year ended april  as a result of the failure of the company s customers to pay cit by the due date 
the factoring agreements were amended effective as of april  to provide for the remittance of customer payments by cit to the company as such payments are received by cit 
cit bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved shipments  while the company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns  allowances  claims and discounts 
cit may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer 
if such a termination or limitation were to occur  the company would either assume the credit risks for shipments to the customer after the date of such termination or limitation or cease shipments to the customer 
factoring fees  which are included in marketing and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  were  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
there were no advances from the factor at either march  or april  critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the securities act  the exchange act and the regulations thereunder as administered by the sec 
references herein to gaap are to topics within the fasb accounting standards codification the fasb asc  which the fasb periodically revises through the issuance of an accounting standards update asu and which has been established by the fasb as the authoritative source for gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the listing below  while not inclusive of all of the company accounting policies  sets forth those accounting policies which the company management believes embody the most significant judgments due to the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
inventory valuation the preparation of the company financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company consolidated balance sheets and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income and  therefore  has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in the accounting periods 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which includes the direct supplier acquisition cost  duties  taxes and freight  and the indirect costs to design  develop  source and store the product until it is sold 
once cost has been determined  the company s inventory is then stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are acquired 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  then differences would result in the valuation of the company inventories and in the amount and timing of the company cost of goods sold and resulting net income for the reporting period 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be sold within the company s normal operating cycle 
to the extent that any of these conditions is believed to exist or the market value of the inventory expected to be realized in the ordinary course of business is otherwise no longer as great as its carrying value  an allowance against the inventory value is established 
to the extent that this allowance is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in cost of goods sold in the company consolidated statements of income 
only when inventory for which an allowance has been established is later sold or is otherwise disposed is the allowance reduced accordingly 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from management estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may not fully realize the carrying value of its inventory or may need to establish additional allowances  either of which could materially impact the company financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition sales are recorded when goods are shipped to customers and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical rates 
allowances for returns  advertising allowances  warehouse allowances  placement fees and volume rebates are recorded commensurate with sales activity or using the straight line method  as appropriate  and the cost of such allowances is netted against sales in reporting the results of operations 
shipping and handling costs  net of amounts reimbursed by customers  are not material and are included in net sales 
allowances against accounts receivable the company s allowances against accounts receivable are primarily contractually agreed upon deductions for items such as cooperative advertising and warehouse allowances  placement fees and volume rebates 
these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity or using the straight line method  as appropriate 
funding of the majority of the company s allowances occurs on a per invoice basis 
the allowances for customer deductions  which are netted against accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  consist of agreed upon cooperative advertising support  placement fees  markdowns and warehouse and other allowances 
all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales  and such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activities or as a straight line amortization charge of an agreed upon fixed amount  as appropriate to the circumstances for each arrangement 
when a customer requests deductions  the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer s account balance 
the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels 
the timing of the customer initiated funding requests for advertising support can cause the net balance in the allowance account to fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of such funding requests should have a minimal impact on the consolidated statements of income since such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activity or using the straight line method  as appropriate 
to reduce its exposure to credit losses  the company assigns the majority of its receivables under factoring agreements with cit 
in the event a factored receivable becomes uncollectible due to creditworthiness  cit bears the risk of loss 
the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectiblity of its non factored accounts receivable when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts  which it accomplishes by specifically analyzing accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms 
royalty payments the company has entered into agreements that provide for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales with certain minimum guaranteed amounts 
these royalty amounts are accrued based upon historical sales rates adjusted for current sales trends by customers 
royalty expense is included in cost of sales and amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company s provision for income taxes includes all currently payable federal  state  local and foreign taxes that are based on the company taxable income and the change during the fiscal year in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the company provides for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company s policy is to recognize the effect that a change in enacted tax rates would have on net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period that the tax rates are changed 
the company provision for income taxes on continuing operations is based on effective tax rates of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
these effective tax rates are the sum of the top us statutory federal income tax rate and a composite rate for state income taxes  net of federal tax benefit  in the various states in which the company operates 
management evaluates items of income  deductions and credits reported on the company s various federal and state income tax returns filed and recognizes the effect of positions taken on those income tax returns only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
based on its recent evaluation  the company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s policy is to accrue interest expense and penalties as appropriate on any estimated unrecognized tax benefits as a charge to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
depreciation and amortization the company s consolidated balance sheets reflect property  plant and equipment  and certain intangible assets at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are three to eight years for property  plant and equipment  and one to sixteen years for intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company amortizes improvements to its leased facilities over the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
valuation of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in addition to the depreciation and amortization procedures set forth above  the company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
in the event of impairment  the asset is written down to its fair market value 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are recorded at the lower of net book value or fair market value  less estimated costs to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal  and are classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company tests the carrying value of its goodwill annually on the first day of the company s fiscal year 
an additional impairment test is performed during the year whenever an event or change in circumstances suggest that the fair value of the goodwill of either of the reporting units of the company has more likely than not fallen below its carrying value 
patent costs the company incurs certain legal and related costs in connection with patent applications 
the company capitalizes such costs to be amortized over the expected life of the patent to the extent that an economic benefit is anticipated from the resulting patent or alternative future use is available to the company 
the company also capitalizes legal costs incurred in the defense of the company s patents when it is believed that the future economic benefit of the patent will be maintained or increased and a successful defense is probable 
capitalized patent defense costs are amortized over the remaining expected life of the related patent 
the company s assessment of future economic benefit or a successful defense of its patents involves considerable management judgment  and a different conclusion or outcome of litigation could result in a material impairment charge up to the carrying value of these assets
