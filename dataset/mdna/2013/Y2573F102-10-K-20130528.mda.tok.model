overview we are a leading global supply chain solutions provider  offering advanced design  manufacturing and logistics and after sales services to oems of a broad range of electronics products in the following markets high reliability solutions hrs  which is comprised of our medical  automotive  and defense and aerospace businesses  high velocity solutions hvs  which includes our mobile devices business  including smart phones  and consumer electronics  including game consoles  high volume computing business  including notebook personal computing pc  tablets and printers  industrial and emerging industries iei  which is comprised of large household appliances  equipment  and our emerging industries businesses  and integrated network solutions ins  which includes our telecommunications infrastructure  data networking  connected home  and server and storage businesses 
our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive  vertically integrated global supply chain services through which the we can design  build  ship and service a complete packaged product for our oem customers 
this enables our oem customers to leverage our services to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle 
historically  our industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design and manufacturing requirements 
we have seen an increase in the penetration of the global oem manufacturing requirements since the technology downturn as more and more oems pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing 
due to the global economic crisis  which began in late calendar year and continued through the end of our fiscal year  many of our oem customers reduced their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing which negatively impacted our business 
during our fiscal year  we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our oem customers end products was improving  and this trend continued through the end of our fiscal year 
however  our revenues in fiscal declined primarily as a result of our exit from the high volume and low margin odm pc business  which we fully exited by the end of fiscal  and from a reduction of concentration of business with a well known smart phone oem 
we use a portfolio management approach to manage our extensive service offerings 
as our oem customers change in the way they go to market  we reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers needs and requirements and to optimize our operating results 
as part of our portfolio management strategy  we have decreased the percentage of our revenue from our 
table of contents lower margin hvs businesses by exiting our odm pc business in fiscal and assembly disengagement with a well known smart phone oem in fiscal over the past few years  we have experienced increased revenue in our more complex and higher margin business groups hrs  iei  and ins together with new business opportunities 
although our recent acquisition of certain manufacturing operations from google motorola mobility llc is expected to increase the percentage of our revenues from the hvs market in fiscal year and beyond  we do not expect the percentage of revenues from our hvs business to approach the concentration experienced in fiscal year and prior 
the objective of our operating model is to allow us to redeploy and reposition our assets and resources to meet specific customer needs across all of the markets we serve  and we have been able to successfully reposition hvs assets and capacity to serve our customers in other business groups as required which illustrates the overall flexibility of our model 
we are one of the world largest manufacturing service providers  with revenues of billion in fiscal year we have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world major electronics markets asia  the americas and europe in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional oems 
we design  build  ship  and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in over countries across four continents 
as of march   our total manufacturing capacity was approximately million square feet 
in fiscal year  our net sales in asia  the americas and europe represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales  based on the location of the manufacturing site 
the following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment  by country  based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages fiscal year ended march  net sales in thousands china mexico u 
s malaysia hungary other fiscal year ended march  property and equipment  net in thousands china mexico u 
s malaysia hungary other we believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services  significant scale and global presence  end to end services  advanced supply chain management  industrial campuses in low cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing  manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional oems 
through these services and facilities  we offer our oem customers the ability to 
table of contents simplify their global product development  manufacturing process  and after sales services  and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the following changes in the macro economic environment and related changes in consumer demand  the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing  the number and size of new manufacturing programs  the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  seasonal demand  shortages of components and other factors  the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products  or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance  our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our oem customers  the effects on our business due to our customers products having short product life cycles  our customers ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities  our customers decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements  our exposure to financially troubled customers  and integration of acquired businesses and facilities 
we also are subject to other risks as outlined in item a  risk factors 
net revenues for fiscal year decreased or billion to billion 
this decline was primarily attributable to the disengagement of our assembly activities with a well known smart phone oem and the exit of our odm pc business  which resulted in decreases of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
our revenue deteriorated in all the major markets we serve except for hrs 
by the end of fiscal year  we continued to strive to maintain a competitive position driven in part by the success in our diversified business model 
our fiscal year gross profit totaled billion  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal year primarily due to restructuring charges amounting to million included in cost of sales in fiscal year our income from continuing operations of million was lower than the million realized in fiscal year primarily due to restructuring charges incurred in fiscal cash provided by operations increased approximately million to billion for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions which decreased million in fiscal year primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory  offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other current and noncurrent liabilities 
our average net working capital  defined as accounts receivable plus the deferred purchase price receivable from our asset backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable  as a percentage of annual sales was approximately  and for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage for the year ended march  is primarily attributable to lower revenue from our hvs business as a result of our exit of our odm pc business  which historically carries significantly higher inventory turns and customers with contractually faster payment terms  offset by lower accounts receivable  deferred purchase price receivables and inventories in fiscal year our free cash flow  which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment  was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher cash flows from operations partially off set by higher capital expenditures 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources section for the free cash flows reconciliation to our most direct comparable gaap financial measure of 
table of contents cash flows from operations 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million during fiscal year and included repurchases of approximately million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase value of million 
as of march   million was included in accrued expenses for approximately million ordinary shares that were not settled in fiscal year throughout fiscal year  we continued to further transform our business as we exited certain non core businesses and executed certain restructuring activities to consolidate and rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure 
during fiscal year  we finalized the sale of two of our non core businesses and received proceeds from these sales amounting to million  net of million of cash sold 
the results of operations and financial position of the divested businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and include a million charge in fiscal for the impairment of fixed assets and million charge for impairment of customer related intangible assets in fiscal additionally  in response to a challenging macroeconomic environment  we initiated certain restructuring activities in fiscal intended to improve our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity 
the restructuring activities are intended to rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure and will result in a further shift of manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies 
during the year ended march   we recognized million of pre tax restructuring charges comprised of million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance costs and million of non cash charges primarily related to asset impairment and other exit charges 
we expect to recognize an additional million in pre tax restructuring charges in our first quarter of fiscal  comprised primarily of cash charges associated with employee termination costs to be classified as a component of cost of sales 
we believe that our business transformation has strategically positioned us very well to take advantage of the long term  future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities  design and engineering services and after market services  which remain strong 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
