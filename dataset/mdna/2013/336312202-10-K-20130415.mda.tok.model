item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following is management s discussion and analysis md a which should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes included in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form k 
year ended december  the following discussion and analysis sets forth the major factors that affected first security s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for the three years ended december  as reflected in the audited financial statements 
strategic initiatives for during the last months  the executive management team has been restructured and our board has increased in size and strength 
our focus has largely been two fold implementing our business strategy and addressing the capital needs of the bank 
we believe our capital and business plans are positioning us appropriately for both short term and long term success 
strategic initiative strengthening capital on april   we announced the completion of our recapitalization 
the recapitalization included a conversion of the tarp cpp preferred stock to common stock as well as an additional issuance of common stock to institutional and other accredited investors 
on april   we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to the us treasury treasury for full satisfaction of the treasury tarp cpp investment  including all associated dividends and warrants 
the treasury immediately sold the common stock to institutional and other accredited investors previously identified by first security for per share 
on april   we issued an additional approximately million shares of common stock at per share to institutional and other accredited investors 
in aggregate  investors purchased  shares for million  or per share 
on april   we downstreamed million to fsgbank to improve fsgbank regulatory capital ratios and to support future balance sheet growth 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
strategic initiative strengthening management we have completed the restructuring of our executive and senior management team 
michael kramer was appointed as ceo and president in december this was followed by the appointment of three executive vice presidents in february  chief credit officer  retail banking officer and director of fsgbank s wealth management and trust department 
we also promoted two tenured managers to the roles of chief administrative officer in february and chief financial officer in february strategic initiative strengthening board of directors during  three additional directors were appointed to the board 
during the first quarter of  an additional three directors were appointed 
mr 
william f 
grant  iii and mr 
robert r 
lane were appointed pursuant to the terms of the series a preferred stock  as elected by the treasury 
the third director  larry d 
mauldin  was appointed as the new independent chairman of the board 
we believe our current board possesses the level of banking  small business and leadership backgrounds which will allow it to provide a strong level of oversight to our management team 
the board is focused on establishing an overall business strategy that supports out fundamental objectives of creating long term stockholder value 
strategic initiative improving asset quality on december   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to sell certain loans 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified million of under and non performing loans to sell and recorded a million loss to reduce the loan balance to the expected net proceeds 
in february  we sold these under and non performing loans 
historically  the credit function was decentralized with lending authority and underwriting conducted regionally 
during  we began the process to centralize all credit functions  including underwriting and approval  document preparation  and collections 
in february  we hired a new chief credit officer who has provided strong oversight in reducing the amount of non performing assets and revising our loan policy 
for  management implemented an incentive plan for the special assets department that rewards both reductions in nonperforming assets and achieving historical realization rates 
we expect a continuation of the higher volume of nonperforming asset resolutions in  which  when combined with the expectation of lower inflows into nonperforming loans  should reduce the overall level of nonperforming assets 

table of contents strategic initiative growing deposit market share the retail banking officer is primarily responsible for managing the branch operations  including the implementation of a sales culture for growing core deposits 
with significant brokered deposits maturing over the next to months  we have the opportunity to replace these high cost deposits with traditional low cost deposits 
clearly defined growth objectives were established for each of our branch locations 
the objectives supported the assumptions in the budget as well as certain aspects of various incentive plans 
leveraging our branches to grow market share with core deposits will reduce our cost of funds  increase our margin and assisting us in achieving overall profitability 
during  we have achieved positive results in implementing our retail deposit strategy 
from december  to december   million of brokered deposits matured and we successfully replaced a majority of these high cost deposits with core deposits 
pure deposits  defined as all transaction accounts  increased million  or  and core deposits increased million  or 
in total  our customer deposits  defined as total deposits less brokered deposits  increased million  which nearly offsets the brokered deposit maturities 
we expect to continue to grow pure and core deposit products per household as well as acquiring new customer relationships 
strategic initiative investing excess liquidity in loans and securities between december of and the first quarter of  we issued over million in brokered deposits to improve our contingent funding capacity 
a majority of these funds were placed in our interest bearing account at the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
we executed this liquidity strategy to provide stability and the ability to fund multiple years of obligations without relying on deposit growth or additional borrowings 
our success in growing customer deposits has allowed us to reduce our liquidity reserves during as of december   our total interest bearing cash was million compared to million at december  during  we have prudently reduced our excess cash position by investing in higher yielding assets  primarily investment securities and loans 
effective january   we implemented a lender incentive plan that included clearly defined goals by lending position as well as strong asset quality expectations 
we believe this renewed focus on loan growth will result in our loan portfolio stabilizing and growing during during  our loans declined by 
the year to date change is below our expectations  but we believe that this is largely attributable to loan sales and resolution of problem assets and net charge offs that improved our asset quality during the company has hired a new chief credit officer which is resulting in changes in our credit culture and changes in our underwriting process 
our lenders have adapted to the new expectations and the loan pipeline has continued to increase 
additionally  we have hired multiple new lenders from large regional institutions within our footprint and we are realizing further growth in the loan pipeline 
generally  we do not place a loan on the pipeline unless there is a greater than likelihood of that loan being approved within the next days 
based on the new lenders and the process changes now fully implemented  we anticipate loan growth for since december   we have had net growth of approximately million in our investment securities portfolio as we have actively invested our excess liquidity 
we have purchased short duration investments to minimize future interest rate risk 
we believe a disciplined approach to allocating our excess liquidity into higher yielding assets will improve our yield on earning assets  increase our margin and assist us in achieving overall profitability 
reverse stock split on september  the effective date  we completed a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock 
in connection with the reverse stock split  every ten shares of issued and outstanding first security common stock at the effective date were exchanged for one share of newly issued common stock 
fractional shares were rounded up to the next whole share 
other than the number of authorized shares of common stock disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets  all prior period share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
for additional information related to the reverse stock split  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
regulatory matters effective september   first security entered into the agreement with the federal reserve bank 
the agreement is designed to ensure that first security is a source of strength to fsgbank 
substantially all of the requirements of the agreement are similar to those already in effect for fsgbank pursuant to the consent order that is described below 
on september   we filed a current report on form k describing the agreement 
the form k also provides a copy of the fully executed agreement 

table of contents we are currently deemed not in compliance with some provisions of the agreement 
any material noncompliance may result in further enforcement actions by the federal reserve bank 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to comply fully with the agreement  that efforts to comply with the agreement will not have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of first security  or that further enforcement actions will not be imposed on first security 
effective april   fsgbank reached an agreement with its primary regulator  the occ  regarding the issuance of a consent order 
the order is a result of the occ s regular examination of fsgbank in the fall of and directs fsgbank to take actions intended to strengthen its overall condition 
all customer deposits remain fully insured by the fdic to the maximum extent allowed by law  the order does not impact this coverage in any manner 
on april   first security filed a current report on form k describing the order and the related actions taken by the bank to date 
the form k also provides a copy of the fully executed order 
we are currently deemed not in compliance with certain provisions of the order  including the capital requirements 
the order required fsgbank to maintain certain capital ratios within days of it execution 
the december  call report was the tenth public financial statement related to a period subsequent to the day requirement 
as of december   the bank s total capital to risk weighted assets was and the tier capital to adjusted total assets was 
the bank has notified the occ of the non compliance with the requirements of the order 
as of april   the occ has not accepted the submitted strategic or capital plans  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  however  the occ is currently reviewing the latest plans 
any material noncompliance may result in further enforcement actions by the occ  including the occ requiring that fsgbank develop a plan to sell  merge or liquidate 
management believes the successful execution of the strategic initiatives discussed below will ultimately result in full compliance with the order and position the bank for long term growth and a return to profitability 
overview market conditions most indicators point toward the overall us economy continuing to improve during as our financial results can be a reflection of our regional economy  we closely monitor and evaluate local and regional economic trends 
amazon 
com opened two distribution centers in our markets in the million investments created more than  full time jobs and an additional  seasonal jobs in hamilton and bradley counties 
amazon is currently in the process of expanding its chattanooga facility and anticipates the expansion will translate to additional hiring  with a peak of  positions in the billion volkswagen automotive production facility has produced more than  passats since beginning production on may  volkswagen has invested billion in the local economy for the chattanooga plant and created more than  direct jobs in the region 
according to independent studies  the volkswagen plant is expected to generate billion in income growth and an additional  jobs related to the project 
wacker chemical is building a billion polysilicon production plant for the solar power industry near cleveland  tennessee 
the plant is expected to create an additional direct jobs for our market area  with the current staffing level of approximately we believe the positive economic impact on chattanooga and the surrounding region from amazon  volkswagen and other recently announced large economic investments will be significant and it may stabilize and possibly increase real estate values and enhance economic activity within our market area 
while the national economy continues to struggle to recover from the recession  with higher unemployment across the country  our larger market areas benefit from more stable rates of employment 
our major market areas of chattanooga and knoxville have a lower unemployment rate of and  respectively  as of december  than the tennessee rate of 
the economy of the dalton  georgia msa is primarily centered on the carpet and floor covering industries 
with the decline in housing starts and the overall economy  dalton has been the most negatively impacted region in our footprint  with the dalton  georgia msa experiencing layoffs of approximately  jobs from june to june the unemployment rate in the dalton msa is as of december compared to the georgia rate of 
all three msas have experienced a decrease in the number of unemployed workers since december  with declines of in chattanooga  in knoxville and in dalton since the peak in june we believe these positive employment trends will continue into 
table of contents our market area has also benefited from an increasingly stable housing environment 
according to the national association of realtors  the median sales prices of existing single family homes increased significantly in  with the chattanooga msa increasing and the knoxville msa increasing year over year 
the increase in the median sales price from to was for the chattanooga msa and for the knoxville msa compared to increase for the nation and a increase for the census region identified as the south as of december  the national association of realtors forecasts median home prices to continue increasing in for both new and existing homes 
cpp investment on january   as part of the capital purchase program cpp under the troubled asset relief program tarp of the united states department of treasury treasury  we agreed to issue and sell  and the treasury agreed to purchase  shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation preference of  per share and a ten year warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  par value  at an exercise price of per share the warrant  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the preferred shares qualify as tier capital and pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
dividends are payable quarterly on february  may  august and november of each year 
on april   as part of the recapitalization  treasury will exchange the series a preferred stock and the warrant for shares of our common stock  treasury will immediately sell such shares of common stock to investors 
as previously reported  william f 
grant  iii and robert r 
lane were elected to the first security board of directors  in both were elected to the pursuant to the terms of first security s outstanding series a preferred stock 
under the terms of the series a preferred stock  treasury has the right to appoint up to two directors to first security s board of directors at any time that dividends payable on the series a preferred stock have not been paid for an aggregate of nine quarterly dividend periods 
the terms of the series a preferred stock provide that treasury will retain the right to appoint such directors at subsequent annual meetings of shareholders until all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods have been paid or until treasury no longer holds our securities 
members of the board of directors elected by treasury have the same fiduciary duties and obligations to all of the shareholders of first security as any other member of the board of directors 
while treasury s contractual rights do not address service on first security s subsidiary fsgbank s board of directors  first security has reviewed the qualifications of mr 
lane and mr 
grant and believes their respective appointments to the fsgbank board of directors is in the best interests of first security and its stockholders 
following the redemption of the securities held by treasury on april   treasury no longer has a contractual right to appoint directors to the board of directors 
however  the board of directors requested that mr 
grant and mr 
lane continue their service on the boards of both first security and fsgbank  and each agreed to continue to serve 
financial results as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of million  total deposits of billion and stockholders equity of million

all prior periods have been restated to give retroactive effect to the one for ten reverse stock split that took effect on september  net interest income for declined by million compared to primarily as a result of the reduction in the loan portfolio as well as the negative spread caused by brokered deposits issued in the provision for loan and lease losses increased million  mostly as a result of the write down on loans identified to be included as part of the loan sale described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income increased by thousand primarily as a result of increased mortgage loan service fees and the gain on the sale of oreo 
noninterest expense increased by thousand 
the increase was largely due to increases in salary and benefit expense  partially offset by reduced write downs and holding costs on oreo 
full time equivalent employees were at december  compared to at december  
table of contents net interest income for declined by million compared to primarily as a result of the reduction in the loan portfolio as well as the negative spread caused by brokered deposits issued in and the associated increase in interest bearing cash 
the provision for loan and lease losses decreased million as a result of the decreased level of charge offs 
noninterest income declined by thousand primarily a result of lower deposit fees 
noninterest expense increased by million 
the increase was largely due to increases in write downs and holding costs on oreo and repossessions  professional fees  and data processing expenses  partially offset by reductions in salary and benefit expense and fdic insurance expense 
full time equivalent employees were at december   compared to at december  our efficiency ratio increased to in versus in and in the efficiency ratio for increased as a result of the combined million decline in net interest income and noninterest income and the thousand increase in noninterest expense 
the stabilization and improvement of our efficiency ratio to more historical levels is dependent on our ability to stabilize the loan portfolio and reduce expenses associated with nonperforming assets 
net interest margin in was  or basis points lower  compared to the prior period of 
the net interest margin of our peer group as reported on the december  uniform bank performance report was and for and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  we issued over million in brokered deposits to build excess cash reserves to reduce liquidity risk resulting from deteriorating asset quality and the consent order 
average other earning assets decreased to million in from million in and million in the impact of the excess liquidity is estimated to have reduced our net interest margin by approximately basis points 
we anticipate that our margin will improve during as brokered deposits mature and the excess liquidity declines 
our expectations are dependent on our ability to raise core deposits  our loan and deposit pricing  and any possible actions by the federal reserve board to the target federal funds rate 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
our significant accounting policies are described in note under  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding this md a 
critical accounting policies include the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on our financial presentation as well as accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements that require us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time 
disclosure about critical estimates is required if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced through loan and lease charge offs  net of recoveries 
the level of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio  past loan loss experience  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current economic conditions and other factors as well as the level of specific impairments associated with impaired loans 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions or changes to our estimated risks could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance 
such a change could materially impact our net income as a result of the change in the provision for loan and lease losses 
refer to the provision for loan and lease losses and allowance sections within md a for a discussion of our methodology of establishing the allowance as well as note to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates of fair value fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
our available for sale securities and held for sale loans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  fair value is used to measure certain assets and liabilities on a non recurring basis 
we use fair value on a non recurring basis for other real estate owned  repossessions and collateral associated with impaired collateral dependent loans 
fair value is also used in certain impairment valuations  including assessments of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
estimating fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
accounting guidance provides three levels of fair value 
level fair value refers to observable market prices for identical assets or liabilities 
level fair value refers to similar assets or liabilities with observable market data 
level fair value refers to assets and liabilities where market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for similar assets or 
table of contents liabilities 
level valuations require modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analysis 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability 
changes in fair value could materially impact our financial results 
refer to note  fair value measurements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our methodology of calculating fair value 
income taxes we are subject to various taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and we estimate income tax expense based on amounts that we expect to owe to these jurisdictions 
we evaluate the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on a current estimate of annual net income  tax credits  non taxable income  non deductible expenses and the applicable statutory tax rates 
the estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported in the consolidated statements of income 
the accrued tax liability or receivable represents the net estimated amount due or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities or other assets  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by tax authorities and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  if or when they occur  could impact accrued taxes and future tax expense and could materially affect our financial results 
we periodically evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of tax reserves related to each of these positions 
additionally  we evaluate our deferred tax assets for possible valuation allowances based on the amounts expected to be realized 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
changes in the results of these evaluations could have a material impact on our financial results 
refer to note  income taxes  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as well as the income taxes section of md a for more information

as above  these figures reflect the effect of the one for ten reverse stock split

net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings is our primary source of operating income 
in  net interest income was million  or less than the level of million  which was less than the level of million 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits

table of contents nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balance 
only the interest collected on such loans has been included as income 
interest income from securities and loans includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of approximately for all years reported and where applicable  state income taxes  to increase tax exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis 
the net taxable equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table were million  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table shows the relative impact on net interest income to changes in the average outstanding balances volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid by us on such assets and liabilities

average loans decreased in by million  or  while average interest bearing liabilities declined by or million  with average brokered deposits accounting for million  a reduction 
the total impact on net interest income from changes in volume was a reduction of million comparing to the reduction in yield on average earning assets reduced interest income by million in the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets declined basis points in to from in the reduction in yield on earning assets was primarily attributable to a decline in yield on taxable investment securities to in from in the reduction in yield on average earning assets reduced interest income by million in the tax equivalent yield on average earning assets declined basis points in to from in the reduction in yield on earning assets was primarily attributable to a decline in yield on taxable investment securities to in from in we continue to maintain an asset sensitive balance sheet  which means that earning assets reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities and thus interest income declines faster than interest expense in a declining rate environment and conversely  interest income will increase faster than interest expense in a rising rate environment 
total interest expense was million in  compared to million in and million in increases in retail and jumbo cds of million and million  respectively  increased interest expense in by million  while declining interest rates on those deposits reduced interest expense million 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  we issued over million in brokered deposits to reduce the increasing liquidity risk associated with our declining asset quality 
as we are restricted from renewing brokered deposits  our average balance of brokered deposits will decline as maturities occur 
during  brokered deposits decreased by million  reducing interest expense by million 
average brokered deposits decreased by million in  reducing interest expense by million 
for  the net impact on changes in volume of interest bearing liabilities resulted in a million decrease in interest expense 
in  the net impact on changes in volume of interest bearing liabilities resulted in a million decrease to interest expense over levels 
deposit pricing  especially for time deposits  typically lags changes in the target federal funds rate  and therefore we realized a consistent but gradual reduction in our costs of deposits throughout and the reduction of costs on interest bearing liabilities reduced interest expense million in and million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities for decreased by basis points to after having decreased by basis points from to in the average rate paid on in market retail cds declined by basis points and the average rate paid on jumbo cds declined by basis points  resulting in a savings of million 
we expect average earning assets to stabilize in as loan volume improves and investment securities increase through the reallocation of our excess cash reserves into higher yielding assets 
the average yield on loans in is anticipated to decline slightly compared to as we expect to operate in a more competitive environment during we expect average brokered deposits to decline during while all other interest bearing liabilities increase  with average interest bearing liabilities comparable to levels 
rates paid on deposits are expected to decline slightly compared to rates as higher rate brokered cds are replaced with lower rate core deposits or funded from our excess liquidity 
net interest income net interest spread and net interest margin the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of noninterest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing noninterest bearing deposits in earning assets 
our net interest rate spread on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in  while the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for and was primarily due to reductions in our loan portfolio as well as the negative spread created by the issuance of brokered deposits in late and early noninterest bearing deposits contributed basis points to the margin during compared to basis points in and basis points in in prior years  we terminated two sets of interest rate swaps 
the combined gains at termination were million  which are being accreted into income over the remaining life of the originally hedged items 
the swaps added million  million and million in interest income for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents we anticipate our net interest spread and net interest margin to stabilize and improve during however  improvement is dependent on multiple factors including our ability to raise core deposits  our growth or contraction in loans  our deposit and loan pricing  maturities of brokered deposits  and any possible further action by the federal reserve board to adjust the target federal funds rate 
provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations during increased million to million in  compared to million in and million in net charge offs totaled million for  million for  and million for net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  in and in we estimate the allowance for loan losses quarterly  as described in detail below 
the allowance is funded through provision expense 
for  various factors contributed to a higher provision expense 
primarily  net charge offs significantly increased in as compared to this was  in part  due to the markdowns relating to the sale of certain under and non performing loans  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the allowance to total loans ratio and the required allowance decreased during mostly as a result of the decrease in the loan portfolio 
collectively  these factors resulted in a provision expense of million  or approximately more than the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses in relative to was mostly due to increased net charge offs  in particular  charge offs related to the purchase agreement to sell certain under and nonperforming loans 
in addition  our analysis of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio in relation to the reduction of our portfolio  the level of impaired  past due  charged off  classified and non performing loans  as well as general economic conditions 
during  while we experienced higher charge offs  we had lower levels of classified and non performing loans  and thus  we decreased the ratio of the allowance to total loans to from 
in  we increased our allowance for loan and lease losses from of total loans as of december  to of total loans as of december  the provision expense associated with decreasing our reserve as a percentage of loans was approximately million in and million in as of december   we determined our allowance of million was adequate to provide for credit losses  which we describe more fully below in the allowance for loan and lease loss section of md a 
we will continue to provide provision expense to maintain an allowance level adequate to absorb known and probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
as the determination of provision expense is a function of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we cannot reasonably estimate the provision expense for furthermore  the provision expense could materially increase or decrease in depending on a number of factors  including  among others  the level of net charge offs  the amount of classified loans and the value of collateral associated with impaired loans

total service charges  including non sufficient funds nsf fees  were million  or of total noninterest income  compared with million  or of total noninterest income for  and million  or of total noninterest income for while service charges and fees on deposit accounts typically correspond to the level and mix of our customer deposits  the continued implementation of the dodd frank financial reform legislation may directly or indirectly impact the fee structure of our deposit products  therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate deposit fees for future periods 
point of sale fees increased to million in compared to pos fees are primarily generated when our customers use their debit cards for retail purchases 
we anticipate pos fees to continue to grow as customer trends show increased use of debit cards  although it is unclear if provisions affecting interchange fees for card issuers included in the dodd frank financial reform legislation will have a future material impact on this product and its revenue 
mortgage loan and related fees for were thousand  compared to thousand in and thousand in our process to originate and sell a conforming mortgage in the secondary market typically takes to days from the date of mortgage origination to the date the mortgage is sold to an investor in the secondary market 
due to the normal processing time  we will have a certain amount of held for sale loans at any time 
we sell these loans with the right to service the loan being released to the purchaser for a fee 
mortgages originated for sale in the secondary markets totaled million for  million for and million for mortgages sold in the secondary market totaled million for  million for and million for for  due to an increased number of seasoned mortgage originators and improved market conditions  we plan to increase loan and fee volumes 
bank owned life insurance income decreased slightly to thousand for compared to a consistent million for and the company is the owner and beneficiary of these contracts 
the income generated by the cash value of the insurance policies accumulates on a tax deferred basis and is tax free to maturity 
additionally  the insurance death benefit will be a tax free payment to the company 
this tax advantaged asset enables us to provide benefits to our employees 
on a fully tax equivalent basis  the weighted average interest rate earned on the policies was during during  we sold approximately million of available for sale securities for a net gain of thousand 
during  we did not sell any available for sale securities 
during  we sold approximately million of investment securities for a net gain of thousand 
other income for was million  compared to the level of million and the level of million 
the components of other income primarily consist of atm fee income  trust fee income  underwriting revenue  safe deposit box fee income and gains on sales of other real estate  repossessions  leased equipment and premises and equipment 
gains on sales increased thousand and trust fees decreased thousand in compared to we anticipate our other income to be consistent or to increase in 
table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense for was million  compared to million in and million in for  increased salaries and benefits and furniture and equipment expenses fully offset the savings from decreased costs associated with nonperforming assets

as of december   we had full service banking offices with full time equivalent employees 
as of december   we had full service banking offices and one leasing loan production facility with full time equivalent employees 
total occupancy expense for increased by compared with  which was lower than total occupancy expense in the increase in was mainly due to increases in lease expense for branch locations  while the decrease in was primarily due to closing seven branches in as of december   we leased six facilities and the land for three branches 
as a result  occupancy expense is higher than if we owned these facilities  including the real estate  but conversely  we have been able to deploy the capital into earning assets rather than capital expenditures for facilities 
furniture and equipment increased due to to software licenses and electronic banking fees related to the core conversion during communication expense decreased both in and due to cost controls implemented 
printing and supplies expense decreased in due to cost controls implemented but increased in due to increased check activity and additional full time equivalent employees 
advertising expenses decreased in but have increased from due to increased marketing 
professional fees decreased by thousand  or from to  and increased thousand  or  from to the decreased amount of professional fees is primarily due to legal cost savings associated with the lower levels of non performing assets during the last six months of professional fees also include fees related to investor relations  outsourcing compliance and information technology audits and a portion of internal audit to professional bank services  as well as external audit  tax services and legal and accounting advice related to  among other things  foreclosures  lending activities  employee benefit programs  prospective capital offerings and regulatory matters 
we anticipate professional fees to be consistent or lower for 
table of contents the premium paid for fdic deposit insurance increased thousand in compared to  compared to a decrease of thousand to million in compared to 
the increase for is an indirect result of the items in the consent order  including the deterioration of our asset quality and its impact on our financial results  among other items 
the decrease in was the result of a change in the calculation of the fdic insurance premium base as the result of the dodd frank act  more fully described above 
we anticipate professional fees to be consistent or lower for data processing expense was higher in compared to and the increase for was partially driven by one time charges as a result of our core conversion 
the monthly fees associated with data processing are typically based on transaction volume 
write downs on oreo and repossessions decreased million  or  from to  and increased million  or  from to at foreclosure or repossession  the fair value of the property is determined and a charge off to the allowance is recorded  if applicable 
any decreases in value subsequent to the initial determination of fair value are recorded as a write down 
as a general policy  we re assess the fair value of oreo and repossessions on at least an annual basis or sooner if indications exist that deterioration in value has occurred 
write downs are based on property specific appraisals or valuations 
additionally  we evaluate on an ongoing basis our realization rate compared to our book value 
as a result of this analysis  write downs decreased during as a result of a decreased rate of foreclosure in and additional write downs during to reduce each property to the historical realization rates 
write downs for are dependent on real estate market conditions and our ability to liquidate properties 
losses on oreo  repossessions and fixed assets decreased thousand  or from to  and increased thousand  or from to the majority of losses were related to sales of foreclosed properties 
for  we anticipate consistent or lower levels in losses as we liquidate existing properties with the continued market recovery 
oreo and repossession holding costs include  among other items  maintenance  repairs  utilities  taxes and storage costs 
holding costs decreased thousand  or from to  and increased thousand  or from to historically  our holding costs have been commensurate with the level of nonperforming assets 
for  we anticipate comparable or lower holding costs depending on our ability to maintain our oreo portfolio at decreased levels 
intangible asset amortization decreased by thousand  or  in compared to and increased by thousand  or  in as compared to the core deposit intangible assets amortize on an accelerated basis over an estimated useful life of ten years 
the following table represents our anticipated intangible asset amortization over the next five years  excluding new acquisitions  if any 
in thousands core deposit intangible amortization expense other expense decreased by thousand  or  for compared to  and increased by thousand  or  for compared to the decrease in is primarily the result of decreased franchise tax expense and shareholder expenses being inflated due to the for reverse stock split 
the increase in is primarily the result of increased costs of insurance as well as higher shareholder expenses associated with the for reverse stock split 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of thousand in  compared to income tax expense of thousand in and income tax expense of million in we recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the deferred tax valuation allowance reduces our net deferred tax assets to an amount that we consider realizable  which is zero 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the evaluation requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all available positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions 
we identified as positive evidence the forecasts of future income based on our recapitalization of the company 
negative evidence included cumulative losses in recent years 
as conditions change  we will evaluate the need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance 
currently  we anticipate increasing the valuation allowance to offset any future recorded tax benefit to result in minimal  if any  income tax expense or benefit 
at december   we evaluated our significant uncertain tax positions 
under the more likely than not threshold guidelines  we believe we have identified all significant uncertain tax benefits 
we evaluate  on a quarterly basis or sooner if necessary  to determine if new or pre existing uncertain tax positions are significant 
in the event a significant uncertain tax position is determined to exist  penalties and interest will be accrued in accordance with internal revenue service guidelines  
table of contents and recorded as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements 
at january   we had accrued million for an uncertain tax position and approximately thousand in associated interest and penalties 
during and  certain tax refunds were withheld and applied to the disputed uncertain tax position 
on april   the company entered into a compromise and settlement of its uncertain tax position for tax years through december  the settlement provided for payment by the company of approximately thousand on its million uncertain tax position 
the settlement resulted in a recovery of approximately thousand  recorded as a tax benefit during the second quarter of on october   the company adopted a tax benefits preservation plan the nol rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right each a right and collectively  the rights for each outstanding share of the company common stock  par value per share the common stock  payable to holders of record as of the close of business on november  the record date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one thousandth of one share of series b participating preferred stock  no par value  of the company the series b preferred stock  at a purchase price equal to per one one thousandth of a share  subject to adjustment the rights or series b purchase price 
the description and terms of the rights are set forth in the plan  dated october   as the same may be amended from time to time  between the company and registrar and transfer company  as rights agent 
purpose of the nol rights plan the company has previously experienced substantial net operating losses  which it may carryforward in certain circumstances to offset current and future taxable income and thus reduce its federal income tax liability  subject to certain requirements and restrictions 
the purpose of the nol rights plan is to help preserve the value of the company deferred tax assets  such as its net operating losses tax benefits  for us federal income tax purposes 
these tax benefits can be valuable to the company 
however  if the company experiences an ownership change  as defined in section section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  its ability to use the tax benefits could be substantially limited and or delayed  which would significantly impair the value of the tax benefits 
generally  the company would experience an ownership change under section if one or more percent shareholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders over the preceding three year period 
as a result  the company has utilized a trigger threshold in the plan that is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or entity seeking to acquire or more of the outstanding common stock without the prior approval of the board 
on october   in connection with the adoption of the nol rights plan  the company filed articles of amendment to the charter of incorporation the articles amendment with the secretary of state of the state of tennessee 
further details about the plan and the articles amendment can be found in exhibits and to the current report on form k filed with the sec on october  statement of financial condition our total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million  or  over the decline in assets was concentrated in our interest bearing deposits in banks  the loan portfolio and other real estate owned  which declined million  million and million during  respectively 
the decline in interest bearing deposits in banks  loans and other real estate owned was partially offset by increases in investment securities and loans held for sale by million and million  respectively 
during  we anticipate that our total assets will increase as loans grow in response to increased marketing and lender accountability measures 
additionally  we anticipate funding prudent investment opportunities through growth in core deposits and with our existing cash reserves 
loans the effects of the economic recession  as well as our active efforts to reduce certain credit exposures and their related balance sheet risk  resulted in declining loan balances during during  total loans declined million  or  compared to year end the decrease in loan balances is primarily associated with declines in our exposure to construction and land development loans of million  or  and residential family real estate loans of million  or 
multi family and farmland real estate loans  consumer installment loans and leases all declined as well 
a large portion of the decline in total loans was due to the transfer of loans originally held for investment to loans held for sale 
commercial real estate loans increased by million  or  primarily due to purchases of us government guaranteed loans during the year 
the purchases of the guaranteed portion of the us government guaranteed loans provide a higher rate of return for our excess liquidity and reduces the overall credit risk of our loan portfolio 
commercial and industrial loans also saw a small increase 
as we develop and implement lending initiatives  we will focus on extending prudent loans to creditworthy consumers and businesses 
we anticipate our loans to grow during funding of future loans may be restricted by our ability to raise 
table of contents core deposits  although we may use current cash reserves  as necessary and appropriate 
loan growth may also be restricted by the necessity to maintain appropriate capital levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we launched an advertising campaign aimed at generating loan demand and attracting new credit worthy customers 
we anticipate our loans to stabilize during however  funding of future loans may be restricted by our ability to raise core deposits  although we may use our current cash reserves  as necessary and appropriate 
loan growth may also be restricted by the necessity for us to maintain appropriate capital levels  as well as adequate liquidity

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses allowance overview the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects our assessment and estimate of the risks associated with extending credit and our evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
we regularly analyze our loan portfolio in an effort to establish an allowance that we believe will be adequate in light of anticipated risks and loan losses 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  we review the size  quality and risk of loans in the portfolio 
we also consider such factors as our loan loss experience  specific known risks  the status and amount of past due and non performing assets  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current and anticipated economic conditions  and other factors which we believe affect the allowance for potential credit losses 
the allowance is composed of two primary components specific impairments for substandard nonaccrual loans and leases and general allocations for classified loan pools  including special mention and substandard accrual loans  as well as general allocations for the remaining pools of loans 
we accumulate pools based on the underlying classification of the collateral 
each pool is assigned a loss severity rate based on historical loss experience and various qualitative and environmental factors  including  but not limited to  credit quality and economic conditions 
the following loan portfolio segments have been identified real estate residential family  real estate commercial  real estate construction  real estate multi family and farmland  commercial  consumer  leases and other 
we evaluate the risks associated with these segments based upon specific characteristics associated with the loan segments 
the risk associated with the real estate construction portfolio is most directly tied to the probability of declines in value of the residential and commercial real estate in our market area and secondarily to the financial capacity of the borrower 
the risk associated with the real estate commercial portfolio is most directly tied to the lease rates and occupancy rates for commercial real estate in our market area and secondarily to the financial capacity of the borrower 
the other portfolio segments have various risk characteristics  including  but not limited to the borrower s cash flow  the value of the underlying collateral  and the capacity of guarantors 
an analysis of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is prepared jointly by our accounting and credit administration departments and presented to our board of directors or the directors loan committee on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our analysis  we may determine that our future provision expense needs to increase or decrease in order for us to remain adequately reserved for probable  incurred loan losses 
as stated earlier  we make this determination after considering both quantitative and qualitative factors under appropriate regulatory and accounting guidelines 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance compared to a group of peer banks 
during their routine examinations of banks  the regulators may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  their credit evaluations and allowance methodology differ materially from the bank s methodology 
we believe our allowance methodology is in compliance with regulatory inter agency guidance as well as applicable gaap guidance 
while it is our policy to charge off all or a portion of certain loans in the current period when a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses that cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because the assessment of these risks includes assumptions regarding local and national economic conditions  our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance may change from our original estimates as more information becomes available and events change 
allowance loan pools as indicated in the allowance overview above  we analyze our allowance by segregating our portfolio into two primary categories impaired loans and non impaired loans 
impaired loans are individually evaluated  as further discussed below 
non impaired loans are segregated first by loan risk rating and then into homogeneous pools based on loan type  collateral or purpose of proceeds 
we believe our loan pools conform to regulatory and accounting guidelines 

table of contents impaired loans generally include those loan relationships in excess of thousand with a risk rating of substandard nonaccrual or doubtful 
for these loans  we determine the impairment based upon one of the following methods discounted cash flows  observable market pricing or the fair value of the collateral 
the amount of the estimated loss  if any  is then specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance unless the relationship is considered collateral dependent  in which the estimated loss is charged off in the current period 
for non impaired loans  we first segregate special mention and non impaired substandard loans into two distinct pools 
all remaining loans are further segregated into homogeneous pools based on loan type  collateral or purpose of proceeds 
each of these pools is evaluated individually and is assigned a loss factor based on our best estimate of the loss that potentially could be realized in that pool of loans 
the loss factor is the sum of an objectively calculated historical loss percentage and a subjectively calculated risk percentage 
the actual annual historical loss factor is typically a weighted average of each period s loss 
for the historical loss factor  we utilize a migration loss analysis 
each period may be assigned a different weight depending on certain trends and circumstances 
the subjectively calculated risk percentage is the sum of eight qualitative and environmental risk categories 
these categories are evaluated separately for each pool 
the eight risk categories are underlying collateral value  lending practices and policies  local and national economies  portfolio volume and nature  staff experience  credit quality  loan review and competition  regulatory and legal issues 
allowance loan risk ratings a consistent and appropriate loan risk rating methodology is a critical component of the allowance 
we classify loans as pass  special mention  substandard impaired  substandard non impaired  doubtful or loss 
the following describes our loan classifications and the various risk indicators associated with each risk rating 
a pass rating is assigned to those loans that are performing as contractually agreed and do not exhibit the characteristics of the criticized and classified risk ratings as defined below 
pass loan pools do not include the unfunded portions of binding commitments to lend  standby letters of credit  deposit secured loans or mortgage loans originated with commitments to sell in the secondary market 
loans secured by segregated deposits held by fsgbank are not required to have an allowance reserve  nor are originated held for sale mortgage loans pending sale in the secondary market 
a special mention loan risk rating is considered criticized but is not considered as severe as a classified loan risk rating 
special mention loans contain one or more potential weakness es  which if not corrected  could result in an unacceptable increase in credit risk at some future date 
these loans may be characterized by the following risks and or trends loans to businesses downward trend in sales  profit levels and margins impaired working capital position compared to industry cash flow strained in order to meet debt repayment schedule technical defaults due to noncompliance with financial covenants recurring trade payable slowness high leverage compared to industry average with shrinking equity cushion questionable abilities of management weak industry conditions inadequate or outdated financial statements loans to businesses or individuals loan delinquencies and overdrafts may occur original source of repayment questionable documentation deficiencies may not be easily correctable loan may need to be restructured collateral or guarantor offers adequate protection unsecured debt to tangible net worth is excessive a substandard loan risk rating is characterized as having specifically identified weaknesses and deficiencies typically resulting from severe adverse trends of a financial  economic  or managerial nature  and may warrant non accrual status 
substandard loans have a greater likelihood of loss and may require a protracted work out plan 
substandard impaired loans are relationships in excess of thousand and are individually reviewed 
in addition to the factors listed for special mention loans  substandard loans may be characterized by the following risks and or trends loans to businesses sustained losses that have severely eroded equity and cash flows concentration in illiquid assets serious management problems or internal fraud 
table of contents chronic trade payable slowness  may be placed on cod or collection by trade creditor inability to access other funding sources financial statements with adverse opinion or disclaimer  may be received late insufficient documented cash flows to meet contractual debt service requirements loans to businesses or individuals chronic or severe delinquency or has met the retail classification standards which is generally past dues greater than days frequent overdrafts likelihood of bankruptcy exists serious documentation deficiencies reliance on secondary sources of repayment which are presently considered adequate demand letter sent litigation may have been filed against the borrower loans with a risk rating of doubtful are individually analyzed to determine our best estimate of the loss based on the most recent assessment of all available sources of repayment 
doubtful loans are considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual 
for doubtful loans  the collection or liquidation in full of principal and or interest is highly questionable or improbable 
we estimate the specific potential loss based upon an individual analysis of the relationship risks  the borrower s cash flow  the borrower s management and any underlying secondary sources of repayment 
the amount of the estimated loss  if any  is then either specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance or charged off 
in addition to the characteristics listed for substandard loans  the following characteristics apply to doubtful loans loans to businesses normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased seriously impaired cash flow numerous exceptions to loan agreement outside accountant questions entity s survivability as a going concern financial statements may be received late  if at all material legal judgments filed collection of principal and interest is impaired collateral guarantor may offer inadequate protection loans to businesses or individuals original repayment terms materially altered secondary source of repayment is inadequate asset liquidation may be in process with all efforts directed at debt retirement documentation deficiencies not correctable the consistent application of the above loan risk rating methodology ensures we have the ability to track historical losses and appropriately estimate potential future losses in our allowance 
additionally  appropriate loan risk ratings assist us in allocating credit and special asset personnel in the most effective manner 
significant changes in loan risk ratings can have a material impact on the allowance and thus a material impact on our financial results by requiring significant increases or decreases in provision expense 
allowance analysis and discussion the following table presents an analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
the provision for loan and lease losses in the table below does not include our provision accrual for unfunded commitments of thousand for each of    and the reserve for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled thousand and thousand as of december  and  respectively

the comprehensive allowance analysis jointly developed by our credit administration and accounting groups enable us to allocate the allowance based on risk elements within the portfolio 
the unallocated reserve is available as a general reserve against the entire loan portfolio and is related to factors such as current economic conditions which are not directly associated with a specific loan category

over the last year  our allowance as a percentage of total loans has significantly decreased mostly due to a decrease in the loan portfolio caused by charge offs of non performing loans 
the allowance to total loans decreased to as of december   compared to as of december  and as of december  as of december   million of the allowance was associated with general reserves and thousand was associated with specific reserves 
the following table provides the company s internal risk rating by loan classification as utilized in the allowance analysis as of december  pass special mention substandard non impaired substandard impaired total in thousands loans by classification real estate residential family real estate commercial real estate construction real estate multi family and farmland commercial consumer leases  net of unearned income other total loans 
table of contents as of december   the largest components of the allowance were associated with family residential real estate loans  commercial loans and commercial real estate loans 
these classifications have higher levels of substandard  non impaired loans 
these loans are subject to general allowance allocations based on historical loss and qualitative and environmental factors 
the allowance allocation associated with commercial real estate loans declined by million during the allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans declined by million during each is a result of significant charge offs during as well as a declining level of substandard  impaired loans at year end 
in addition  we have approximately million in government guaranteed loans that drive the required allowance for loan and lease losses down 
the elevated level of charge offs in will continue to impact the loss factors within the allowance during future periods 
we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  is sufficient to absorb probable  incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on our assessment of the information available  including the results of extensive internal and independent reviews of our loan portfolio  as discussed in the asset quality and non performing asset section below 
our assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the level of the allowance as compared to total loans may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their reviews warrant 
asset quality and non performing assets asset quality strategic initiatives for and beyond our ability to return to profitability is largely dependent on properly addressing and improving asset quality 
as of december   our loan portfolio was of total assets 
over the past three and half years  we ve implemented a number of significant strategies to further address our asset quality 
the implementation of these strategies has assisted our ability to reduce our total nonperforming loans in by million  or approximately  and to reduce our total nonperforming assets by million  or approximately 
we believe our continued implementation of these  and related  strategies  will enable us to show further improvement in our asset quality in during the fourth quarter of  we began the process of restructuring our credit administration department to add additional depth and expertise and to fully centralize our credit underwriting process 
with the additional depth and expertise of the restructured credit department  in we centralized our loan underwriting  document preparation and collections processes 
this centralization has improved consistency  increased quality and provided higher levels of operational efficiencies 
collectively  we believe these changes will assist in reducing current and future non performing assets our internal loan review department performs risk based reviews and historically targets to of our portfolio over an month cycle 
to achieve such coverage  we have continued to use third parties to supplement the coverage of our internal loan review department 
during  we achieved the to review of our portfolio over a month cycle  focusing on a risk based approach 
we anticipate similar coverage for during the second half of  we began outsourcing the marketing and sales process of our oreo properties to market leading real estate companies 
we experienced higher volumes of oreo sales in and  and we expect to continue seeing high levels of sales into throughout and  we hired multiple experienced special assets officers and centralized the handling of all classified loans by our special assets team 
on february   we hired christopher g

loans past due ninety days and still accruing include thousand from loans held for investment and thousand of loans transferred into loans held for sale 
see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we place loans on nonaccrual when we have concerns relating to our ability to collect the loan principal and interest  and generally when loans are or more days past due 
as previously described  we have individually reviewed each nonaccrual relationship in excess of thousand for possible impairment 
we measure impairment by adjusting the loans to either the present value of 
table of contents expected cash flows  the fair value of the collateral or observable market prices 
as of december   the book value of impaired loans totaled million  or less than impaired loans as of december  the associated unpaid principal balances of the impaired loans totaled million as of december  this represents an approximately discount through previously recorded partial charge offs and specific reserves currently in the allowance 
as of december   the book value of impaired loans totaled million with the unpaid principal balances totaling million 
from year end to year end  nonaccrual loans decreased by million  or 
as shown above  construction and land development nonaccrual loans decreased by million to million and commercial real estate nonaccrual loans decreased by million to million comparing year end to year end these decreases were primarily due to migration to oreo and repossessions  as well as charge offs and principal payments 
we are actively pursuing the appropriate strategies to reduce the current level of nonaccrual loans 
other real estate owned decreased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  we have outsourced the marketing and sales process of our oreo properties to market leading real estate firms 
during  we sold properties for million  compared to sold properties for million in during april  we conducted a bulk auction on approximately properties consisting of smaller balance family residential and lot properties 
the results of this auction allowed our special assets department to focus on the larger value properties remaining in our portfolio 
we expect continued oreo resolutions during due to our new approach to marketing these properties and general stabilization in the real estate markets in our footprint 
loans days past due and still accruing were million as of december  compared to million as of december  of these past due loans as of december   residential family real estate loans totaled  thousand  or of the total past dues while commercial and industrial loans totaled thousand  or of the total 
as of december   we owned repossessed assets  which are carried at fair value less anticipated selling costs  in the amount of thousand compared to thousand as of december  the majority of our repossessions are related to our leasing portfolio that primarily includes trucking and construction equipment leases 
our asset quality ratios are less favorable compared to our peer group 
our peer group  as defined by the uniform bank performance report ubpr  consists of all commercial banks between billion and billion in total assets

investment securities and other earning assets the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of our consolidated balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
currently  all of our investments are classified as available for sale 
as of december   we had no plans to liquidate a significant amount of any securities 
however  the securities classified as available for sale may be used for liquidity purposes should management deem it to be in our best interest 
securities in our portfolio totaled million at december   compared to million at december  we believe our current level of investment securities provides an appropriate level of liquidity and provides a proper balance to our interest rate and credit risk in our loan portfolio 
the increase in securities of million represented a decision that liquidity was sufficient to warrant the shifting of additional cash into investment securities 
as of december   the available for sale securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of approximately million as compared to unrealized gains of million at december  our securities portfolio at december  consisted of tax exempt municipal securities  federal agency bonds  federal agency issued real estate mortgage investment conduits remics and federal agency issued pools

however  should conditions change  we may sell unpledged securities 
we consider the overall quality of the securities portfolio to be high 
all securities held are historically traded in liquid markets  except for one bond  which is valued utilizing level inputs 
the level security was a pooled trust preferred security with a book value of thousand 
as of december   we performed an impairment assessment of the securities in our portfolio that had an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their cost was other than temporary 
under authoritative accounting guidance  impairment is considered other than temporary if any of the following conditions exists we intend to sell the security  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or we do not expect to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis  even if we do not intend to sell 
additionally  accounting guidance requires that for impaired securities that we do not intend to sell and or that it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell prior to recovery but for which credit losses exist  the other than temporary impairment should be separated between the total impairment related to credit losses  which should be recognized in current earnings  and the amount of impairment related to all other factors  which should be recognized in other comprehensive income 
if a decline is determined to be other than temporary due to credit losses  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
the new cost basis would not be adjusted in future periods for subsequent recoveries in fair value  if any 

table of contents in evaluating the recovery of the entire amortized cost basis  we consider factors such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including events specific to the issuer or industry  defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest  principal or dividend payments and external credit ratings and recent downgrades 
the following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position  at december  and less than months months or greater totals fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses in thousands december  federal agencies mortgage backed municipals other totals december  federal agencies mortgage backed municipals other totals as of december   gross unrealized losses in the company s portfolio totaled  thousand  compared to thousand as of december  as of december   the unrealized losses in mortgage backed securities consisting of six securities  municipals consisting of twenty securities and federal agencies consisting of ten securities are primarily due to widening credit spreads and changes in interest rates subsequent to purchase 
the unrealized loss in other securities relates to one pooled trust preferred security 
the unrealized loss in the pooled trust preferred security is primarily due to widening credit spreads subsequent to purchase and a lack of demand for trust preferred securities 
we do not intend to sell the investments with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis  which may be maturity 
based on results of the our impairment assessment  the unrealized losses at december  are considered temporary 
as of december   we owned securities from issuers in which the aggregate book value from such issuers exceeded of our stockholders equity 
the following table presents the amortized cost and market value of the securities from each such issuer as of december  book value market value in thousands fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation ginnie mae we held no federal funds sold as of december  and as of december   we held million in interest bearing deposits  primarily at the federal reserve bank of atlanta  compared to million at december  the yield on our account at the federal reserve bank is approximately basis points 
at december   we held million in certificates of deposit at other fdic insured financial institutions  compared to thousand at december  at december  and  we held million and million  respectively  in bank owned life insurance 

table of contents deposits and other borrowings deposits decreased by million  or  from year end to year end  driven primarily by significant declines in brokered deposits and declines in noninterest bearing demand deposits  partially offset by increases in other categories 
retail and jumbo certificates of deposit increased by million  or  during that same period 
excluding brokered deposits  our deposits increased million  or  from year end to year end we define core deposits to include interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts  as well as retail certificates of deposit with denominations less than thousand 
core deposits increased million  or  from year end to year end we consider our retail certificates of deposit to be a stable source of funding because they are in market  relationship oriented deposits 
core deposit growth is an important tenet of our business strategy 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  the presence of a capital requirement restricts the rates that we can offer on deposit products 
we received a determination letter from the fdic designating our market areas as high rate markets for and as such  we may offer rates up to basis points above the prevailing local market rates 
brokered deposits decreased million  or  from year end to year end the decrease is primarily due to scheduled and called maturities 
in addition to brokered certificates of deposits  we are a member bank of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars network 
cdars is a network of banks that allows customers cds to receive full fdic insurance of up to million 
additionally  as a member bank  we have the opportunity to purchase or sell one way time deposits 
at year end  our cdars balance consisted of thousand in purchased time deposits and no reciprocal customer accounts 
brokered deposits at december  and  were as follows in thousands brokered certificates of deposits cdars as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  the presence of a capital requirement in our consent order restricts our ability to accept  renew  or roll over brokered deposits without prior approval of the fdic 
the liquidity enhancement over the last two years was in part to ensure we have adequate funding to meet our short term contractual obligations 
we believe that our current liquidity  along with maintaining or increasing core deposits  will provide for our short term contractual obligations  including maturing brokered deposits 
the table below is a maturity schedule for our certificates of deposit  including brokered cds  in amounts of thousand or more as of december  less than months three months to six months six months to twelve months greater than twelve months in thousands certificates of deposit of thousand or more brokered certificates of deposit cdars at december  and we had securities sold under repurchase agreements with commercial checking customers of million and million  respectively 
we also had a structured repurchase agreement with another financial institution of million at december  this agreement had a five year term with a variable rate of three month libor minus basis points for the first year and a fixed rate of for the remaining term 
the agreement was callable on november   the first anniversary  and quarterly thereafter 
the agreement matured in november as a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb  we have the ability to acquire short and long term advances through a blanket agreement secured by our unencumbered qualifying family first mortgage loans and by pledging investment securities or individual  qualified loans  subject to approval of the fhlb 
due to the consent order  we are currently not allowed to receive advances through the fhlb 

table of contents the following note was paid off during the terms of the other borrowing as of december  were as follows maturity year origination date type principal original term rate maturity in thousands fixed rate mortgage months interest rate sensitivity financial institutions are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that their interest bearing liabilities consisting principally of customer deposits mature or reprice more or less frequently  or on a different basis  than their interest earning assets generally consisting of intermediate or long term loans  investment securities and federal funds sold 
the match between the scheduled repricing and maturities of our earning assets and liabilities within defined time periods is referred to as gap analysis 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a positive or asset sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a positive or asset sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  we issued million in brokered certificates of deposits with an average maturity of approximately years at a weighted average all in cost of 
the issuances established a strong liquidity position used to fund prudent loans and to pay for future contractual obligations 
at december   we held million in interest bearing cash  which was primarily held at the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
the issuance combined with the retention of the cash positions us to be asset sensitive in preparation for future increases in interest rates 
we anticipate rates to begin to increase in  depending on economic conditions 
the following gap analysis provides information based the next repricing date or the maturity date 
the interest rate risk income sensitivity summary table located in item a incorporates additional assumptions  including prepayments on loans and securities and reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments  and deposits 
we believe the income sensitivity summary table located in item a provides a more accurate analysis related to interest rate risk 
the following table reflects our rate sensitive assets and liabilities by maturity or the next repricing date as of december  variable rate loans are shown in the category of due within three months because they reprice with changes in the prime lending rate 
fixed rate loans are presented assuming all payments are made according to the loan s contractual terms 
additionally  demand deposits and savings accounts have no stated maturity  however  it has been our experience that these accounts are not entirely rate sensitive  and accordingly the following analysis assumes of interest bearing demand deposit accounts  of money market deposit accounts  and of savings accounts reprice within one year and the remaining accounts reprice within one to five years

we rely primarily on the operations and cash balance of fsgbank to fund the liquidity needs of our daily operations 
our cash balance on deposit with fsgbank  which totaled approximately thousand as of december   is available for funding activities for which fsgbank will not receive direct benefit  such as shareholder relations and holding company operations 
these funds should adequately meet our cash flow needs 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the written agreement with the federal reserve requires prior written authorization for any payment to first security that reduces the equity of fsgbank  including management fees 
if necessary  we will seek quarterly management fee authorizations for if we determine that our cash flow needs will be satisfactorily met  we may deploy a portion of the funds into fsgbank 
since january  to further preserve our capital resources  our board of directors elected to suspend the dividend on our common stock and elected to defer the dividend payment on our series a preferred stock starting with the first quarter of as the payment of future dividends requires prior written consent by the federal reserve  we anticipate continuing to defer the dividend payments on the preferred stock until conditions improve 

table of contents the liquidity of fsgbank refers to the ability or financial flexibility to adjust its future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the primary sources of funds for fsgbank are cash generated by repayments of outstanding loans  interest payments on loans and new deposits 
additional liquidity is available from the maturity and earnings on securities and liquid assets  as well as the ability to liquidate securities available for sale 
as of december   our interest bearing account at the federal reserve bank of atlanta totaled approximately million 
this liquidity is available to fund our contractual obligations and prudent investment opportunities 
another source of funding is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the service rights 
as of year end  we had thousand in loan participations sold 
fsgbank may elect to sell loan participations as a source of liquidity 
an additional source of short term funding would be to pledge investment securities against a line of credit at a commercial bank 
as of december   fsgbank had million in borrowings against investment securities pledge for repurchase agreements  treasury tax and loan deposits  and public fund deposits attained in the ordinary course of business 
as of december   our unpledged securities totaled million 
historically  we have utilized brokered deposits to provide an additional source of funding 
as of december   we had million in brokered cds outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of approximately months  a weighted average coupon rate of and a weighted average all in cost which includes fees paid to deposit brokers of 
our cdars product had thousand at december   with a weighted average coupon rate of and a weighted average remaining life of approximately months 
our certificates of deposit greater than thousand were generated in our communities and are considered relatively stable 
during  we were approved to use the federal reserve discount window 
we applied to utilize the federal reserve window as an abundance of caution due to the economic climate 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  the presence of a capital requirement in our consent order restricts our ability to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits without prior approval of the fdic 
we believe that our liquidity sources are adequate to meet our current operating needs 
we continue to study our contingency funding plans and update them as needed paying particular attention to the sensitivity of our liquidity and deposit base to positive and negative changes in our asset quality 
we also have contractual cash obligations and commitments  which include certificates of deposit  other borrowings  operating leases and loan commitments 
unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled million and million at year end  respectively 
the following table illustrates our significant contractual obligations at december  by future payment period 
contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit cdars federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase operating lease obligations total time deposits give customers rights to early withdrawal 
early withdrawals may be subject to penalties 
the penalty amount depends on the remaining time to maturity at the time of early withdrawal 
for more information regarding certificates of deposits  see deposits and other borrowings 
we expect securities repurchase agreements to be re issued and  as such  they do not necessarily represent an immediate need for cash 
operating lease obligations include existing and future property and equipment non cancelable lease commitments 

table of contents net cash used in operations in totaled million  compared to net cash used in operations of thousand in and net cash provided by operations of million in cash flows from operations in were reduced primarily due to changes in our loans held for sale and a decline in net interest income 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and net cash provided by investing activities of million in for  loan principal collections  net of loan originations  totaled million  compared to million in and million in also for  purchases of available for sale securities were million  compared to million in and million in the increase in the securities portfolio  which was partially offset by the reduction in the loan portfolio  was the primary reason for the year over year change in investing activities 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in and net cash used by financing activities of million in the year over year change in financing activities is primarily related to the decline in brokered cds  which declined by million at december  from december  levels and declined by million at december  from december  levels 
capital resources banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the occ and the federal reserve  the primary federal regulators for fsgbank and first security  respectively  have adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to their assets in accordance with the guidelines 
the consent order the order  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  requires fsgbank to achieve and maintain total capital to risk adjusted assets of at least and a leverage ratio of at least 
the order provided days from april   the effective date of the order  to achieve these ratios 
as shown below  fsgbank is not currently in compliance with the capital requirements 
any material noncompliance may result in further enforcement actions by the occ  including the occ requiring that fsgbank develop a plan to sell  merge or liquidate 
as brokered deposits mature and are funded by available cash  we anticipate our total assets to decline 
a decline in assets may cause both capital ratios to increase  however  continued losses may outpace the benefit to our capital  resulting in a reduction in assets 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have executed our capital plan resulting in an approximately million recapitalization 
we believe the successful execution of the strategic initiatives discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements will ultimately result in full compliance with the agreement and position us for long term growth and a return to profitability 
the following table compares the required capital ratios maintained by first security and fsgbank 
regulatory capital ratios fsgbank consent order minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions minimum capital requirements first security fsgbank as of december  tier capital to risk weighted assets n a total capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio as of december  tier capital to risk weighted assets n a total capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio the consent order required fsgbank to achieve and maintain the above capital ratios within days from april  the federal reserve board definition of well capitalized for bank holding companies does not include a leverage ratio component  accordingly  the leverage ratio requirement for well capitalized status only applies to fsgbank 
due to the capital requirement within fsgbank s consent order  fsgbank may not be considered well capitalized 

table of contents to further preserve our capital resources  during the first quarter of  our board of directors elected to suspend our common stock dividend and defer the dividend on the series a preferred stock 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the written agreement between first security and the federal reserve prohibits us from declaring or paying dividends without prior written consent 
any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors  including our future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  future prospects  regulatory restrictions  and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
our ability to distribute cash dividends in the future may be limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital 
effect of governmental policies we are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve board and the occ 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the national money supply 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board are purchases and sales of us government securities in the marketplace  changes in the discount rate  which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the federal reserve board  and changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions 
these instruments are effective in influencing economic and monetary growth  interest rate levels and inflation 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
because of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money market  as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities  it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates  deposit levels or loan demand or whether the changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings 
legislation from time to time is introduced in the united states congress and the tennessee general assembly and other state legislatures  and regulations are proposed by the regulatory agencies that could affect our business 
it cannot be predicted whether or in what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected thereby 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
since its passage in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry  including significant regulatory and compliance changes previously discussed and including  among other things  i enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies  ii increased regulatory examination fees  and iii numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthening safety and soundness for  the financial services sector 
additionally  the act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic 
many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations  including ours  is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
such commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments 
we follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 

table of contents our maximum exposure to credit risk for unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit at december  and  was as follows unfunded loan commitments in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral  if any  we obtain on an extension of credit is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
all commitments and standby letters of credit were fixed rate as of december  and recent accounting developments the following items represent accounting changes that have been issued but are not currently effective 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for accounting changes that became effective during the current periods 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this update requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of us gaap and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january  we do not believe this update will have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk  with respect to us  is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the risk of loss can result in either lower fair market values or reduced net interest income 
we manage several types of risk  such as credit  liquidity and interest rate 
we consider interest rate risk to be a significant risk that could potentially have a large material effect on our financial condition 
further  we process hypothetical scenarios whereby we shock our balance sheet up and down for possible interest rate changes  we analyze the potential change positive or negative to net interest income  as well as the effect of changes in fair market values of assets and liabilities 
we do not deal in international instruments  and therefore are not exposed to risks inherent to foreign currency 
additionally  as of december   we had no trading assets that exposed us to the risks in market changes 
oversight of our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability committee alco 
alco has established policies and limits to monitor  measure and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds 
in addition  as a result of the changes in executive management  an executive risk committee consisting of the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief credit officer and chief administrative officer has been established to monitor the various risks of first security  including interest rate risk  and will report directly to the audit and enterprise risk management committee of the board of directors 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense associated with our interest sensitive assets and liabilities also change  thereby impacting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco utilizes the results of both static gap and income simulation reports to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to a sustained change in interest rates 
our income simulation analysis projected net interest income based on a decline in interest rates of basis points ie and an increase of basis points and basis points and  respectively over a twelve month period 
given this scenario  as of december   we had an exposure to falling rates and a benefit from rising rates 
more specifically  our model forecasts a decline in net interest income of million  or  as a result of a basis point decline in rates at december  the model predicts a million increase in net interest income resulting from a basis point increase in rates 
finally  the model also forecasts a million increase in net interest income  or  as a result of a basis point increase in rates 
the following chart reflects our sensitivity to changes in interest rates as indicated as of december  the numbers are based on a static balance sheet  and the chart assumes that pay downs and maturities of both assets and liabilities are reinvested in like instruments at current interest rates 
interest rate risk income sensitivity summary down bp current up bp up bp in thousands  except percentages net interest income dollar change net interest income percentage change net interest income the preceding sensitivity analysis is a modeling analysis  which changes periodically and consists of hypothetical estimates based upon numerous assumptions including interest rate levels  shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  rates on loans and deposits  reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments and deposits  and other assumptions 
in addition  there is no input for growth or a change in asset mix 
while assumptions are developed based on the current economic and market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that we might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
we use the sendero vision asset liability system  which is a comprehensive interest rate risk measurement tool that is widely used in the banking industry 
generally  it provides the user with the ability to more accurately model both static and dynamic gap  economic value of equity  duration and income simulations using a wide range of scenarios including interest rate shocks and rate ramps 
the system also models derivative instruments
