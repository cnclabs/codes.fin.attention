word of mouth influences consumers decisions to purchase products and services 
consumers often trust and rely on what other consumers say about a brand  product or service  particularly if they consider the content to be authentic and credible 
consumer interaction through the social web has significantly increased the volume and availability of online word of mouth about products and services  which is proving to have a significant and growing influence on both online and offline commerce 
the rapid adoption of internet enabled mobile devices is further amplifying the impact of online word of mouth by making this content even easier  more convenient and faster to generate and access

historically  we have made substantial investments in research and development  and we plan to continue doing so in order to further differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
in addition  we augment our full time research and development staff with offshore third party contractors located in the ukraine  india and costa rica 
competition the market for social commerce solutions is highly competitive 
the competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because it is at an early stage of development  rapidly evolving  fragmented and subject to potential disruption by new technological innovations 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following product breadth and functionality  scope  quality and breadth of client base  amount and quality of content  service  price  reputation  and operating model efficiency 
we believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above 
we compete primarily against traditional marketing and advertising programs 
many businesses remain hesitant to embrace social commerce solutions  such as ratings and reviews  driven by their reluctance to display negative reviews about their brands  products or services or about other brands displayed on their websites 
additionally  some businesses have developed  or may develop in the future  social commerce solutions internally 
these businesses may consider their internal solutions adequate  even if our solutions are superior 
we have several direct and indirect competitors that provide third party social commerce solutions  including  but not limited to  companies like pluck  reevoo  gigya and viewpoints 
additionally  we face potential competition from participants in adjacent markets that may enter our markets by leveraging related technologies and partnering with other companies 
we may also face competition from companies entering our market  including large internet companies like google and facebook  which could expand their platforms or acquire a competitor 
while these companies do not currently focus on our market  they have significantly greater financial resources and  in the case of google  a longer operating history 
they may be able to devote greater resources to the development and improvement of their services than we can and  as a result  may be able to respond more quickly to technological changes and clients changing needs 
moreover  because our market is changing rapidly  it is possible that new entrants  especially those with substantial resources or more efficient operating models  more rapid product development cycles or lower marketing costs  could introduce new solutions that disrupt the manner in which businesses use online word of mouth and engage with consumers online to address the needs of our clients and potential clients 
we cannot be certain that these competitors  both current and potential  will not offer or develop services that are considered superior to ours or that services other than ours will attain greater market acceptance

technology infrastructure operations we have invested extensively in developing our proprietary technology infrastructure to support the growth of our business 
our proprietary technology infrastructure includes a third party data center  cloud computing and network management  a secure centralized source control management system and proprietary data analytics 
maintaining the integrity and security of our technology infrastructure is critical to our ability to provide online word of mouth  and we have a dedicated security team that promotes industry best practices and drives compliance with data security standards

our technology infrastructure has the ability to handle sudden bursts of activity for users over a short period of time with high levels of performance and reliability 
we operate at a scale that routinely delivers more than million content impressions per day 
key elements of our technology infrastructure are described below 
scalable infrastructure 
our physical network infrastructure utilizes multiple hosted data centers linked with a high speed virtual private network 
we utilize commodity hardware  and our architecture is designed for high availability and fault tolerance while accommodating the demands of our service utilization 
cloud computing innovation 
we have developed our architecture to work effectively in a flexible cloud environment that has a high degree of automated elasticity 
intellectual property our intellectual property includes our patent applications  registered and unregistered trademarks and registered domain names 
we believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our technology infrastructure currently gives us a competitive advantage 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and the european union  as well as contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary technology and assets 
we currently have trademarks registered in the united states for our name and certain of the words and phrases that we use in our business 
we also rely on copyright laws to protect software relating to our websites and our proprietary technologies  although we have not yet registered for copyright protection 
we have registered numerous internet domain names related to our 
table of contents business in order to protect our proprietary interests 
as of april   we had five issued us patents  pending us non provisional patent applications and one pending us provisional patent application 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner 
the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective 
third parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts  other parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites without authorization 
we may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to  infringe upon or diminish the value of our domain names  trademarks  service marks and our other proprietary rights 
competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our solutions 
failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results 
in addition  we license third party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our solutions 
licenses of third party technologies may not continue to be available to us at a commercially reasonable cost or at all 
companies in the internet and technology industries  and other patent  copyright and trademark holders own large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and frequently threaten or enter into litigation based on claims of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties intellectual property rights 
there may be intellectual property rights held by others  including issued or pending patents  copyrights and trademarks  that cover significant aspects of our technologies  content  branding or business methods 
any intellectual property claim against us  regardless of merit  could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management s attention and other resources 
these claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology  content  branding or business methods found to be in violation of another party s rights 
we might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
even if a license is available  we could be required to pay significant royalties  which would increase our operating expenses 
we may also be required to develop alternative non infringing technology  content  branding or business methods  which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive in the social commerce market 
if we cannot license or develop technology  content  branding or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business  we may be unable to compete effectively 
employees as of april   we had full time employees 
we consider our current relationship with our employees to be good
