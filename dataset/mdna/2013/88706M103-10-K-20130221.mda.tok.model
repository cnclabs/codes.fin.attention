franchised restaurant sales are reported to us by our restaurant owners and are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than non owned restaurants consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
franchised restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental revenues  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution sales

table of contents in fiscal  we impaired our portland  providence and hartford markets 
in addition  we closed restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets and restaurants in our portland market  in fiscal these markets represented a relatively small portion of our overall system in the us  but historically had a disproportionately negative impact on average unit volumes 
average unit volumes for standard restaurants in the providence and hartford markets were approximately half of our other core markets in the us asset impairment and closure costs in fiscal related to our closure of underperforming company operated restaurants in southern new england and the impairment of our providence and hartford markets in the us the company sold its joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries for a pre tax gain of million on october  long term debt includes long term debt associated with the canadian advertising fund s expanded menu board program and capital leases  including their current portions 
net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda attributable to tim hortons inc is defined as ebitda after deducting ebitda attributable to variable interest entities vies  which is ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests associated with our non owned restaurants consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules  and any ebitda attributable to our advertising funds 
ebitda is used by management as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and our competitors 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry 
ebitda is not a recognized term under us gaap 
ebitda should not be viewed in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to calculate ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
for instance  ebitda does not include interest expense  and because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and because we use property and equipment  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue  and income tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of our operations  tax expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as capital expenditures  contractual commitments  interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
since not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of ebitda to our net income and operating income fiscal years in thousands net income interest expense  net income tax expense operating income depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda attributable to vies ebitda attributable to tim hortons inc

total systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
us dollar sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from the republic of ireland and the united kingdom licensed locations 
includes both franchised and company operated restaurants 
franchised restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than restaurants whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
us average sales per standard and non standard restaurant are disclosed in both us and canadian dollars  the functional and reporting currency  respectively  of our us operations 
the us average sales per standard and non standard restaurant were converted into canadian dollars for each year using the average foreign exchange rate in the applicable year  which includes the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and decreases comparability between the years 
we believe the presentation of the us dollar average sales per standard and non standard restaurant is useful to investors to show the local currency amounts for restaurants in the us and provides transparency on the underlying business performance without the impact of foreign exchange 
our standard restaurant typically measures between  to  square feet  with a dining room  a counter for placing orders and drive thru service 
standard restaurants comprised of our system as at december  our non standard restaurants include small  full service restaurants and or self serve kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  airports  grocery stores  gas and convenience locations and drive thru only units on smaller pieces of property  including full serve sites located in sports arenas and stadiums that operate only during events with a limited product offering 
included in our us non standard restaurant counts as at december  are event sites 
on average  of these sites were operating during fiscal and had average unit volumes of approximately thousand 
these sites are important as they heighten brand awareness in our developing markets by exposing the brand to a large number of guests and encourage trial as we generally have product exclusivity at these locations 
non standard restaurants comprised of our system as at december  average unit volumes for non standard restaurants exclude volumes from self serve kiosks 
self serve kiosks differ in size and product offering and  as a result  have significantly different economics than our full serve standard and non standard restaurants  including substantially less capital investment  and also contribute significantly less to both systemwide sales as well as our revenues and operating income in each respective region 
self serve kiosks are  however  important as they drive convenience  brand penetration and awareness  especially in the us  where our brand is less developed 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the fiscal consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  annual report 
all amounts are expressed in canadian dollars unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that are not historical facts  but reflect our current expectations regarding future results 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the matters discussed below 
please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in our annual report for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at franchisee owned restaurants and restaurants run by independent operators collectively  we hereunder refer to both franchisee owned and franchisee operated restaurants as franchised restaurants  and company operated restaurants 
as at december    or of our restaurants were franchised 
the amount of systemwide sales affects our franchisee royalties and rental revenues  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in same store sales and changes in the number and type of restaurants  and are ultimately driven by consumer demand 
same store sales growth represents the average growth in retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide that have been open for or more months ie  includes both franchised and company operated restaurants 
it is one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance and provides a useful comparison between periods 
we believe systemwide sales and same store sales growth provide meaningful information to investors regarding the size of our system  the overall health and financial performance of the system  and the strength of our brand and restaurant owner base  which ultimately impact our consolidated and segmented financial performance 
franchised restaurant sales are not generally included in our consolidated financial statements except for certain non owned restaurants consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules  however  franchised restaurant sales result in royalties and rental revenues  which are included in our franchise revenues  and also support growth in distribution sales 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap or gaap 
however  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also contains certain non gaap financial measures to assist readers in understanding the company s performance 
non gaap financial measures either exclude or include amounts that are not reflected in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap

as the franchisor  we collect royalty revenue from franchised restaurant sales 
our business model also includes controlling the real estate for the majority of our franchised restaurants  which generates a recurring stream of rental revenue

we distribute coffee and other beverages  non perishable food  supplies  packaging and equipment to most system restaurants in canada through our distribution centres  and frozen  refrigerated and shelf stable products from our guelph and kingston distribution facilities in our ontario and quebec markets 
in some cases  we also utilize third party distributors

performance against targets the following table sets forth our fiscal actual performance as compared to our fiscal financial targets  as well as management s comments on our performance relative to such targets measure target actual commentary same store sales growth canada us in canada  our same store sales growth was slightly below our targeted range due in part  we believe  to continued challenging macro economic conditions leading to constrained discretionary spending and intensified competition 
despite the challenges noted above  in the us  our same store sales growth was within our targeted range 
restaurant development canada us international restaurants full serve restaurants approximately restaurants restaurants full serve restaurants restaurants we achieved our targeted restaurant development in all of our markets in fiscal with full serve restaurants 
in canada  approximately of restaurant openings were standard format  and openings were focused in ontario  quebec and western canada 
in the us  approximately of our restaurant openings were standard format 
in addition to the full serve restaurant openings  we also opened self serve kiosks 
internationally  we expanded within the gulf cooperation council gcc  focusing mainly on the united arab emirates with primarily standard restaurant openings 
effective tax rate approximately our effective tax rate was on target as we continued to benefit primarily from the last year of canadian statutory rate reductions 

table of contents measure target actual commentary diluted earnings per share attributable to tim hortons inc eps actual eps includes an approximate per share reduction related to the corporate reorganization pre tax expenses of million million after tax  which were not contemplated as part of management s fiscal guidance for eps 
excluding this charge  eps would have been within our targeted range 
a combination of growth in our operating income  a lower effective tax rate  and a reduction in shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were the primary contributors to our eps performance in fiscal capital expenditures canada and us million million capital spending was below our targeted range  due primarily to a lower number of renovations and related project spending for existing restaurants 
we were also able to optimize our distribution operations at our guelph distribution centre deferring  until fiscal  additional capital investments required at this facility to support growth in our business 
we were also on the lower end of our restaurant development targets  and as a result  required less capital for new restaurants in fiscal than planned 
canadian advertising fund up to million million the targeted capital spending of up to million included both the interior and exterior menu board programs 
the tim hortons advertising and promotion fund canada inc ad fund substantially completed its interior digital menu board program in fiscal  and also began rolling out its exterior program along with our drive thru initiatives 
executive overview systemwide sales grew in fiscal  driven by new restaurant development and continued same store sales growth in both canada and the us we believe that our continued same store sales growth demonstrates our resilience and value positioning in the quick service restaurant industry  as we faced a challenging economic climate in fiscal in fiscal  unemployment levels remained high relative to pre recessionary levels  and we believe that a number of global financial events  including the european debt crisis and us budgetary concerns and borrowing limits  generally impacted consumer confidence 
consumer confidence was impacted  we believe  not only in these countries  but also in canada with respect to its economic and foreign trade relationships  which led to constrained domestic discretionary spending and an intensified competitive environment 
same store sales growth in canada of was driven by higher average cheque due primarily to favourable product mix  resulting from continued menu innovation and operational initiatives  and to a lesser 
table of contents extent  pricing 
higher average cheque growth more than offset a decline in same store transactions  which we believe was due  in part  to continued challenging macro economic conditions and intensified competition 
our product mix benefited from our expanded hot beverage selection  such as our espresso based beverages and new hot beverage cup sizing in canada including our new ounce cup  and expanded cold beverage selection 
additionally  continued strength in the breakfast category with our popular breakfast sandwiches  due in part to the extension of our breakfast hours  also contributed favourably to product mix 
the rollout of panini sandwiches in late also proved popular with our guests 
same store sales growth in the us of was driven by higher average cheque due to pricing  and to a lesser extent  favourable product mix as a result of continued menu innovation 
same store transactions also increased slightly in the us in fiscal product mix benefited primarily from the introduction of new products  such as our breakfast panini sandwiches which leveraged our existing panini platform  the continued popularity of our panini sandwiches in the lunch and evening dayparts  and the expansion of our hot beverage selection  including espresso based beverages 
in both canada and the us same store sales growth also benefited from the introduction of our premium blend coffee  decaffeinated coffee  and lattes in a single serve format using kraft s tassimo t disc on demand beverage platform  which rolled out in late fiscal in august  we announced the implementation of an organizational structure which includes a corporate centre and business unit design 
in fiscal  we incurred million of corporate reorganization expenses consisting primarily of termination costs and professional fees 
the company has made significant progress in both its reorganization and ceo succession processes 
we expect to have substantially completed realigning roles and responsibilities within our new structure by the end of the first quarter of at the same time  the board of directors has made significant progress in its external ceo search 
although the process is not yet complete  the board of directors currently anticipates appointing a new ceo by early summer 
while the majority of the costs associated with the reorganization were recognized in fiscal  the company expects to recognize an additional charge of approximately million  primarily related to termination benefits  substantially all of which is expected to be incurred and paid in the first quarter of fiscal further costs related to the ceo transition are anticipated in fiscal  the timing and total impact of which are not yet determinable 
we believe that the new structure will facilitate the execution of strategic initiatives as we continue to grow our business and streamline decision making across the company 
we also believe that the new structure will create scalability for future growth and reduce our cost structure relative to what it otherwise would have been had we not undertaken the reorganization 
operating income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal adjusted operating income  which excludes corporate reorganization expenses in fiscal  and comparatively  the charge associated with the separation agreement with our previous ceo the ceo separation agreement in fiscal see non gaap reconciliation increased million  or 
the increase was driven primarily by systemwide sales growth  resulting in higher rents and royalties and distribution income  partially offset by lower franchise fee income 
net income attributable to tim hortons inc was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  increasing million  or 
the increase was primarily due to higher operating income see above  and a lower effective tax rate on these earnings  partially offset by higher net interest expense 
eps was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  which represents an increase of 
in addition to higher net income attributable to tim hortons inc  our eps growth continued to benefit from the positive  cumulative impact of our share repurchase programs 
on average  we had approximately million fully diluted common shares outstanding during fiscal  which was  on average  approximately million  or  fewer fully diluted common shares outstanding than in fiscal the corporate reorganization expenses incurred in fiscal reduced our eps by approximately  whereas the ceo separation agreement reduced our eps by approximately in the comparative period of fiscal 
table of contents performance targets the following table sets forth management s views regarding fiscal performance and our expectations for achievement of the key financial objectives set forth below measure target commentary same store sales growth canada us we expect to continue our positive same store sales growth trends in both canada and the us despite the continued challenging economic conditions and intensified competitive environment 
we plan to do so with a multi faceted approach that emphasizes our unique market differentiators 
these include reinforcing our value to consumers  leveraging our marketing and brand strengths  operational initiatives designed to increase our restaurant capacity and speed of service  menu and product innovation leveraging our existing categories and platforms  renovations  and new restaurant development 
we have experienced weakness in same store sales growth thus far in fiscal due mainly to a continued challenging economic environment and resulting intensified competitive environment  and unfavourable weather conditions 
we expect weaker same store sales growth in the first quarter of due to these factors and strong prior year comparables  as same store sales growth rates in the first quarter of were in canada and in the us restaurant development canada restaurants we expect to open a total of to restaurants

we intend to continue our development focus in our growth markets  specifically quebec and western canada  and urban core markets 
us full serve restaurants in the us  we expect restaurant formats to be evenly split between standard and non standard full serve locations  and we expect to complement our restaurant openings with self serve kiosks to enhance convenience for our guests

systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation

franchised restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and non owned restaurants consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules consolidated non owned restaurants  on average  for fiscal years and the amount of systemwide sales impacts our royalties and rental revenues  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants ie  historically  the net addition of new restaurants  and are ultimately driven by consumer demand 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from our republic of ireland and united kingdom licensed locations as these locations operate on a significantly different business model compared to our north american and other international operations 
same store sales growth same store sales growth represents the average growth in retail sales at restaurants franchised and company operated restaurants operating systemwide that have been open for or more months 
it is one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance and provides a useful comparison between periods 
our same store sales growth is generally attributable to several key factors  including new product introductions  improvements in restaurant speed of service and other operational efficiencies  hospitality initiatives  frequency of guest visits  expansion into  and enhancement of  broader menu offerings  promotional activities and pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as coffee and other commodities  labour  supplies  utilities and business expenses 
there can be no assurance that these price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon guests maintaining the frequency of their visits and the same volume of purchases at the new pricing

operational initiatives a number of operational initiatives were substantially completed in canada in fiscal  including the installation of wi fi and new interior digital menu boards in more than  of our canadian restaurants to enhance the overall guest experience upon visiting our restaurants 
we remain committed to maintaining our speed of service while accepting a variety of payment methods convenient for our guests 
in fiscal our restaurants in canada began to accept visa credit and prepaid cards  as well as newer and faster electronic payment methods such as visa paywave and interac flash  an enhancement of interac debit 
we also recently began accepting amex and payments using select smartphones at certain restaurants in canada 
in fiscal  a number of drive thru enhancements were implemented  such as double order stations and order station relocations on a limited number of restaurants 

table of contents we plan to continue a number of operational initiatives in fiscal  including installing our enhanced drive thru menu boards and drive thru enhancements  including the new double order stations  to alleviate capacity constraints in canadian restaurants 
renovations to existing restaurants will also be a focus  as we reflect more contemporary design elements from our cafe and bake shop design to canadian restaurants 
these initiatives support our more than a great brand strategic plan  which is designed to drive growth through to the end of through a range of strategies and initiatives 
new restaurant development opening restaurants in new and existing markets in canada and the us has been a significant contributor to our growth

typically  to system restaurants are closed annually  the majority of which have been in canada 
restaurant closures made in the normal course of operations may result from an opportunity to acquire a more suitable location  which will permit us to upgrade size and layout or add a drive thru and typically occur at the end of a lease term or the end of the useful life of the principal asset 
we have also closed  and may continue to close  restaurants for which the restaurant location has performed below our expectations for an extended period of time  and or we believe that sales from the restaurant can be absorbed by surrounding restaurants 
in fiscal  we closed standard restaurants and self serve kiosks in the new england region and standard restaurants in our portland market  all of which arose from strategic profitability reviews of our us operations 
self serve locations generally have significantly different economics than our full serve restaurants  including substantially less capital investment  as well as significantly lower sales and  therefore  lower associated royalties and distribution revenues 
in the us  self serve locations are intended to increase our brand presence and create another outlet to drive convenience  which we believe is important in our developing markets 
in canada  we have used self serve kiosks in locations where existing full service locations are at capacity  among other reasons 
we have a master license agreement with apparel fzco apparel for the development and operation of tim hortons restaurants in the gcc 
the master license agreement is primarily a royalty based model that also 
table of contents included an up front license fee  franchise fees with the opening of each location  and restaurant equipment and distribution sales 
apparel is responsible for the capital spending and real estate development to open restaurants  along with operations and marketing 
in addition  we have exclusive development rights in canada  and certain rights to use licenses in the us within tim hortons locations  to operate cold stone creamery ice cream and frozen confection retail outlets

systemwide sales growth of  driven by incremental sales from the net addition of new restaurants during the year and same store sales growth of  was the primary driver of the increase and resulted in higher rents and royalties and distribution income 
also contributing to growth were lower distribution costs  due in part to operational improvements in our new kingston distribution centre year over year as we incurred start up costs in fiscal partially offsetting these 
table of contents growth factors were lower franchise fee income  due to higher support costs for salaries and benefits related in part to operational initiatives such as the double order station program  and fewer cold stone creamery co branded and standard restaurant openings year over year 
also offsetting these growth factors were higher general and administrative costs due primarily to higher salaries and benefits to support business growth 
total system restaurant transactions continued to grow during fiscal as a result of the addition of new restaurants 
same store sales growth in fiscal was driven by an increase in average cheque due primarily to favourable product mix  and to a lesser extent  pricing 
our product mix benefited from our new hot beverage cup sizing  including our ounce cup  and our expanded hot beverage platform  including our espresso and latte beverages which were introduced in early fiscal we also benefited from continued strength in the breakfast category with the extension of our breakfast hours from am to noon across canada in fiscal product mix also benefited from the rollout of panini sandwiches and our entry into the single serve coffee market with kraft s tassimo t disc on demand beverage platform  which occurred in late fiscal  both of which were well received by our guests

income from manufacturing operations has historically been an important component of our us geographic segment reporting 
same store sales growth in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in average cheque due to pricing  and to a lesser extent  favourable product mix and a slight increase in same store transactions

generally  advertising levies and advertising and marketing expenses incurred by our advertising funds that are not related to the expanded menu board program continue to be netted in operating expenses as the company acts as an agent with regard to these contributions 
in fiscal  the income attributable to vies was million  including million of advertising levies net of operating expenses  related primarily to the expanded menu board program 
comparatively  operating income was million in fiscal  which included an asset impairment charge of million related to vies in the portland market 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated non owned restaurants  resulting from an increase in restaurants opening under operator agreements  primarily in the us  which require minimal upfront capital from the restaurant owner 
operating income related to our vies depends largely on the number of consolidated non owned restaurants  but also varies depending on the size  type  same store sales growth and ultimately  average unit volumes and financial results of the restaurant

the underlying growth was driven primarily by our canadian operating segment  with systemwide sales resulting from same store sales growth at existing locations and incremental systemwide sales at new restaurants  both of which drove higher rents and royalties and distribution income 
our us segment s systemwide sales growth resulted in underlying operating income growth year over year 
absent the ceo separation agreement  corporate charges were lower and  coupled with improved vie income excluding the asset impairment charge  also contributed favourably to our growth 

table of contents canada in fiscal  operating income for our canadian segment was million compared to million in fiscal our canadian segment included the disposition of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries in october  which resulted in a gain on the sale of million  partially offset by a related million restaurant owner allocation

amortization of million and million related to the deferred gain allocated to our continuing supply agreement with maidstone bakeries was included in fiscal and fiscal  respectively

comparatively  systemwide sales growth was in fiscal on a week basis  including same store sales growth of and incremental sales from the net addition of restaurants 
total restaurant transactions in fiscal continued to grow as a result of the net addition of new restaurants 
canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income  as well as higher income from our distribution business  which also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
partially offsetting this growth in segment operating income were higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business as well as investments in our co branding strategy 
in addition  we incurred start up and transition costs associated with the ramp up of our replacement distribution facility in kingston  ontario  which opened in late july same store sales growth in fiscal was driven by an increase in average cheque  which benefited from both favourable product mix and pricing 
partially offsetting these growth factors were economic weakness and generally challenging macro operating conditions  which we believed were factors that led to lower same store transactions in quarters of fiscal we opened restaurants in canada including self serve kiosks  and closed restaurants including self serve kiosks in fiscal comparatively  we opened restaurants including self serve kiosks and closed restaurants in fiscal our new restaurant development was skewed more heavily toward the fourth quarter in each year

table of contents the closure of certain underperforming restaurants  in fiscal  contributed approximately million to the improvement in the us segment operating income due to lower relief  depreciation  and support costs 
partially offsetting this growth was the reinvestment of approximately million of our savings from these closed restaurants into our core us growth markets in northeast and midwest us in fiscal same store sales growth in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in average cheque  which benefited from pricing in the system  favourable product mix  and higher transactions 
we opened restaurants in the us  of which were full serve standard and non standard restaurants  and closed restaurants in fiscal comparatively  we opened restaurants including self serve kiosks and closed restaurants in fiscal  of which were in the new england region and were in our portland market

franchised restaurant sales are reported to us by our restaurant owners  and are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than consolidated non owned restaurants 
franchised restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental revenues  
table of contents which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution sales 
the reported franchised restaurant sales including consolidated non owned restaurants were fiscal years franchised restaurant sales canada canadian dollars us us dollars revenues sales in fiscal  sales increased million  or  to  million 
the increase in sales was primarily driven by our distribution business and from higher vie sales 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal systemwide sales growth increased distribution sales by approximately million due primarily to the higher number of system restaurants year over year  continued same store sales growth  and products newly managed through our supply chain 
pricing and favourable product mix represented approximately million of the increase in distribution sales  due primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities reflective of their higher underlying costs 
our distribution sales continue to be subject to changes related to underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  wheat  edible oils  and sugar  and other product costs 
changes in underlying costs are largely passed through to restaurant owners  but will typically occur after changes in spot market prices as we generally utilize fixed price contracts as a method to provide restaurant owners with consistent  predictable pricing and to secure a stable source of supply 
we generally have forward purchasing contracts in place for a month period of future supply for our key commodities  but have occasionally extended beyond this time frame in periods of elevated market volatility or tight supply conditions 
underlying commodity costs can also be impacted by currency changes 
these cost changes can impact distribution sales  and cost of sales  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
these changes may impact margins in a quarter as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up over a pricing period which may extend beyond a quarter see item a risk factors and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risks 
company operated restaurants sales 
company operated restaurant sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an average of more company operated restaurants in fiscal than in fiscal on average  we operated company operated restaurants during fiscal compared to during fiscal company operated restaurant sales vary with the average number and mix ie  size  location and type of company operated restaurants 
we ended fiscal with company operated restaurants in canada  and in the us  representing approximately of total systemwide restaurants 
on occasion  we may repurchase restaurants from existing restaurant owners  operate them corporately for a short period of time  and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is also impacted by the timing of these events throughout the year 
variable interest entities sales 
vies sales were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in non owned restaurants consolidated in both the us and canada  resulting from an increase in restaurants opening under operator agreements  primarily in the us  as we continue to utilize operator agreements as a means for owners to establish their business 
during fiscal  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants in canada and in the us  on average  compared to non owned restaurants in canada and in the us  on average  during fiscal 
table of contents franchise revenues rents and royalties 
in fiscal  revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  to million 
rents and royalties growth was driven primarily by sales from the net addition of new full serve restaurants across all of our markets year over year  and by same store sales growth  both of which resulted in an approximate million  or  growth in rents and royalties revenues 
in addition  we recognized the advertising levies specifically attributed to the expanded menu board program  which represented an increase of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offsetting these growth factors was the negative impact resulting from a greater number of consolidated non owned restaurants  which reduced growth as the consolidation of these restaurants essentially replaced our rents and royalties revenues with restaurant sales  which are included in vies sales see above under variable interest entities sales 
franchise fees 
in fiscal  franchise fees increased million  or  to million 
the primary factors resulting in higher franchise fees were a higher number of renovations  along with higher non standard restaurant sales  partially offset by lower revenues from cold stone creamery co branded openings 
new restaurants that open under operator agreements  which represent a higher proportion of restaurant openings in the us than in canada  do not result in the recognition of any franchise fees as we retain ownership of the equipment 
in addition  self serve kiosks do not represent a significant portion of franchise fees  as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants  due primarily to the size of the equipment package required 
in fiscal  we opened self serve kiosks as compared to in fiscal total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or 
cost of sales growth was driven primarily by higher distribution cost of sales and higher cost of sales from vies 
distribution cost of sales 
distribution cost of sales increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal systemwide sales growth and an increase in products for which we now manage the supply chain logistics contributed approximately million of the increase in cost of sales 
approximately million of the distribution cost of sales increase related primarily to higher underlying commodity costs  primarily for coffee  and product mix 
our distribution costs are subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  wheat  edible oils  sugar  and other product costs see item ia 
risk factors and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risks 
company operated restaurants cost of sales 
company operated restaurants costs of sales increased by million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cost of sales increased primarily due to an increase in company operated restaurants  as we operated more company operated restaurants  on average  during the year as compared to fiscal cost of sales for our company operated restaurants  which includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  varies with the average number and mix ie  size  location and type of company operated restaurants 
variable interest entities cost of sales 
vies cost of sales was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated non owned restaurants  as during fiscal  on average  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants  compared to non owned restaurants during fiscal additionally  the vies cost of sales increased due to higher sales from existing consolidated non owned restaurants 

table of contents operating expenses total operating expenses increased million to million in fiscal rent expense increased by million year over year  primarily due to additional properties that were leased and then subleased to restaurant owners  and higher percentage rent expense on certain properties resulting from increased restaurant sales 
depreciation expense increased by million  due to the increase in the total number of properties that we either own or lease and then sublease to restaurant owners  and renovations to existing restaurants 
depreciation expense also increased by million due to the expanded menu board program  and by million due to higher project related and other renovation expenses 
franchise fee costs franchise fee costs in fiscal were million  an increase of million over fiscal the increase in fiscal was driven by a higher number of renovations and a higher number of non standard restaurant sales 
also contributing to the increase year over year were increased support costs for higher salaries and benefits  due in part to operational initiatives to build drive thru capacity 
the increased costs were partially offset by fewer cold stone creamery co branded openings in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal adjusting for the ceo separation agreement of million occurring in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million or 
the primary factors driving the increase were higher salaries and benefits required to support growth of the business 
salaries and benefits growth year over year was moderated by lower performance based costs and lower salary and benefits in the fourth quarter as a result of the reorganization 
in general  our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed systemwide sales growth over the longer term 
there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to the timing of certain expenses or events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
from time to time  we may increase investments to support certain strategic initiatives  which may cause general and administrative expense growth to be higher than systemwide sales growth in some periods  however this was not the case during fiscal see corporate reorganization expenses below for our current expectations for general and administrative expenses for fiscal equity income equity income was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal equity income from our timwen partnership reflects the growth in sales at existing restaurants  as we have not developed any new combination restaurants for a number of years 
corporate reorganization expenses in august  we announced the implementation of an organizational structure which includes a corporate centre and business unit design 
broader functional accountabilities are being embedded within the business units  designed to align resources and business unit needs 
in the new organizational structure  a corporate centre has been established to provide central accountability and governance over key enterprise and control activities 
we began the process of implementing this new organizational structure by realigning roles and responsibilities under that new structure in fiscal  and recognized million of corporate reorganization expenses 
reorganization expenses recognized include termination costs of million and professional fees of million 
we expect the realignment of roles and responsibilities to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of the company expects to recognize an additional charge of approximately million  primarily related to termination costs  substantially all of which is expected to be recognized and paid in the first quarter of 
table of contents corporate reorganization expenses recognized in fiscal also included ceo transition costs of million 
the ceo transition costs include an employment agreement with our chief brand and marketing officer and aggregate retention bonuses of up to million for certain senior officers that are only payable if they remain employed for a specified time period subsequent to the transition to a new ceo 
ceo transition costs are being recognized over the estimated service period 
further costs related to the ceo transition are anticipated in fiscal  the timing and total impact of which are not yet determinable 
we believe that the new structure will facilitate the execution of strategic initiatives as we continue to grow our business and streamline decision making across the company 
we also believe that the new structure will create scalability for future growth and reduce our cost structure relative to what it otherwise would have been had we not undertaken the reorganization 
asset impairment and closure costs  net in fiscal  we recognized the final reversal of million of accrued closure costs on the assignment of the remaining leases related to the new england markets 
comparatively  in fiscal  we recorded a net asset impairment and closure cost charge of million  consisting of an asset impairment charge of million related to the portland market  partially offset by approximately million of accrued closure costs that were reversed upon the substantial conclusion of closure activities related to the new england markets 
approximately million of this asset impairment charge recognized in fiscal was related to vies in the portland market  with the remaining net recovery of million related to our us segment 
other income  net in fiscal  other income  net  was nil compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of gains from additional properties sold in fiscal interest expense total interest expense  including interest on our long term debt  capital leases and credit facilities  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense related primarily to additional interest on an increased number of capital leases outstanding year over year and the interest expense associated with the ad fund s borrowings under its revolving credit facility  used to fund the expanded menu board program 
interest income interest income is comprised primarily of interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents 
interest income was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in interest income year over year was primarily due to lower average cash balances 
in the first half of  we held a significant portion of the proceeds received from the sale of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries  which were predominantly used to repurchase common shares under our share repurchase program 
income taxes total tax expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our effective income tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal our fiscal effective tax rate was favourably impacted by the benefit associated with canadian statutory rate reductions and the reduction in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by losses not benefited for tax and by an increase in tax imposed by foreign jurisdictions on income

the increase in sales was primarily driven from our distribution business  but was also favourably impacted by the million allocation made to restaurant owners in fiscal  which was recorded as a reduction of sales  and to a lesser extent  higher company operated restaurant sales 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from vies 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal systemwide sales growth increased distribution sales by approximately million due to continued same store sales growth  a higher number of restaurants year over year  and new products managed through our supply chain  including additional output from maidstone bakeries 
favourable product mix and pricing represented approximately million of the increase in distribution sales  due primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities reflective of the higher underlying costs 
in addition  growth year over year benefited from a million reduction in fiscal sales related to the restaurant owner allocation made in relation to the sale of maidstone bakeries

same store sales growth during fiscal provided approximately million of rents and royalties growth 
the net addition of new full service restaurants in canada and the us year over year and the net restaurant additions from fiscal which had not then been open for more than months contributed approximately million 
lower relief  primarily recognized in the us  mainly from the closure of underperforming restaurants in certain markets in the new england region in the fourth quarter of fiscal  contributed much of the remaining growth

franchise fees were million in fiscal  increasing million over fiscal a higher number of standard and non standard restaurant openings was the primary growth driver during fiscal in addition  a higher number of resales and replacements  and the recognition of fees associated with our master license agreement with apparel related to our international expansion  also contributed to growth year over year

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity has historically been  and continues to be  cash generated from canadian operations which has for the most part self funded our operations  growth in new restaurants  capital expenditures  dividends  normal course share repurchases  acquisitions and investments 
our us operations have historically been a net user of cash given investment plans and stage of growth  and we expect this trend to continue in our million revolving bank facility revolving bank facility provides an additional source of liquidity  of which approximately million was undrawn as at december  see credit facilities below for additional information 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations  as compared to million in fiscal  for a net increase of million see comparative cash flows below for a description of sources and uses of cash 
we believe that we will continue to generate adequate operating cash flows to fund both our capital expenditures  excluding the expanded menu board program which is a capital expenditure of the ad fund  and our expected debt service requirements over the next months 
if additional funds are needed for strategic initiatives or other corporate purposes beyond current availability under our revolving bank facility  we believe that  with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong capital structure  we could borrow additional funds 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited by our financial and other covenants under our revolving bank facility 
our senior unsecured notes  coupon  series  due june  senior notes are not subject to any financial covenants  however  the senior notes contain certain other covenants  which are described below 
any such borrowings may result in an increase in our borrowing costs 
if such additional borrowings are significant  our credit rating may be downgraded  and it is possible that we would not be able to borrow on terms which are favourable to us 
the senior notes were offered on a private placement basis in the first and fourth quarters of for total net proceeds of million  including a premium of million 
the company also entered into interest rate forwards with a notional value of million  which acted as a cash flow hedge to limit the interest rate volatility in the period prior to the initial issuance of the senior notes  and resulted in a loss of million on

the premium  the loss on the interest rate forwards  and financing fees of approximately million were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations over years 
the effective yield  including all fees  premium and the interest rate forwards loss  is 
the senior notes bear a fixed interest coupon rate of with interest payable in semi annual installments  in arrears  which commenced december  the senior notes rank equally and pari passu with each other and with the notes of every other series regardless of their actual time of issue issued under the trust indenture  and with all other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of tim hortons inc the borrower  including amounts owing under the revolving bank facility see below  except as to any sinking fund which pertains exclusively to any particular indebtedness of the borrower  and statutory preferred exceptions 
the senior notes are initially guaranteed by the tdl group corp 
tdl  the borrower s largest canadian subsidiary 
for as long as the borrower s and tdl s third party revenues represent at least of the consolidated revenues of the company  as tested quarterly on a rolling twelve month basis  tdl will remain the sole subsidiary guarantor 
to the extent that combined third party revenues of these entities is less than of consolidated revenues  additional guarantors must be added until of consolidated revenues are reached or exceeded 
in each case  the borrower s subsidiary with the highest gross revenue must be one of the guarantors 
alternatively  if the borrower s third party revenues reach or exceed of consolidated revenues  the guarantors will be released 
there are also certain covenants limiting liens to secure borrowed money subject to permitted exceptions and limiting our ability to undertake certain acquisitions and dispositions subject to compliance with certain requirements  but there are no financial covenants 
the senior notes are redeemable  at the borrower s option  at any time  upon not less than days notice  but no more than days notice  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i a price calculated to provide a yield to maturity from the redemption date equal to the yield on a non callable government of canada bond with a maturity equal to  or as close as possible to  the remaining term to maturity of the senior notes  plus  and ii par  together  in each case  with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date fixed for redemption 
in the event of a change of control and a resulting rating downgrade to below investment grade  the borrower will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
when evaluating our leverage position  we look at metrics that consider the impact of long term operating and capital leases as well as other long term debt obligations 
we believe this provides a more meaningful measure of our leverage position given our significant investments in real estate 
as at december   we had approximately million in long term debt and capital leases on our balance sheet  excluding ad fund debt related to the expanded menu board program 
we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet  including our cash position  provides us with opportunity and flexibility for future growth while still enabling us to return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and our share repurchase program 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction  renovations of existing restaurants  expansion of our business through vertical integration and general corporate needs 
in addition  we utilize cash to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 
historically  our annual working capital needs have not been significant 
in each of the last fiscal years  operating cash flows have funded our capital expenditure requirements for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
our capital spending in is expected to be higher than in previous years  as we execute a number of operational initiatives along with our restaurant owners  and may continue at these higher levels in the future 
in addition to restaurant development in both canada and the us  our increased spending also includes our share of costs to increase restaurant capacity in canada  including initiatives such as selectively implementing drive thru order station relocations  double order stations  and double lane drive thrus 
we plan to continue to invest in our distribution facilities to support continued future growth  as well as certain technology investments in fiscal our increased capital expenditures also reflect investments to complete a higher number of renovations in

net cash provided from operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
strong earnings during both fiscal and fiscal were the primary drivers of operating cash flows

also  in the first quarter of  we had million of tim card redemptions that were not offset by a reduction in restricted cash and cash equivalents as restricted investments matured and were reflected in investing activities 
the remaining increase year over year was primarily driven by working capital movements specific to the first half of  including a distribution of million to restaurant owners related to the sale of maidstone bakeries 
we also made tax payments  including approximately million related to the sale of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries that were remitted in early fiscal this was partially offset by the recognition in fiscal of accruals of million related to the corporate reorganization  the majority of which we expect will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing an increase of million

the application of critical accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note of our consolidated financial statements 
included in our significant accounting policies are certain policies that we believe are both significant and may require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of our operations 
these assumptions and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis based on new events occurring  additional information being obtained or more experience being acquired 
please see note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of the new accounting standards adopted in fiscal the adoption of new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
described below are critical accounting policies which involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity  and which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes when considered necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
changes in judgment that result in subsequent recognition  derecognition or a change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period including any related interest and penalties are recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs 
we record interest and potential penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we classify a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit as a long term liability except for the liabilities that are expected to be settled within the next months 
property and equipment we carry our property and equipment at cost  and estimate useful lives based on historical data  industry trends  and legal or contractual lives 
useful lives are also influenced by management estimates  and changes in the estimated planned use or legal or contractual lives may result in accelerated depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
we monitor our capitalization and amortization policies on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicates impairment may exist triggering event 
our long lived assets consist primarily of restaurant related long lived assets 
restaurant related long lived assets are grouped into operating markets for impairment testing purposes  as this is the lowest identifiable level of independent cash flows 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred is subjective  and we consider factors such as prolonged negative same store sales growth in the operating market which is a key operating metric  prolonged negative cash flows in the operating market  or a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in any one market 
we also consider the maturity of the affected market ie  whether the affected market is developed or developing  and the type of market investment  such as strategic investments 
in developed markets  one of the key indicators for the overall health of an operating market is same store sales growth 
in developing markets  we assess a number of factors  including systemwide sales growth  which includes both new restaurants and same store sales growth  the stage of growth of the operating market  the average unit sales volume trends  overall long term performance expectations  as well as higher than normal restaurant closures in a market 
if it is determined that a triggering event has occurred  an undiscounted cash flow analysis is completed on the affected market to determine if the future expected cash flows of a market are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
a key assumption within our undiscounted cash flow analysis is estimated same store sales growth 
expected future cash flows also are affected by various external factors  such as local economic factors  demographics  and consumer behavior 
if it is determined that the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient  then the market is deemed to be impaired 
the fair value of the long lived assets is estimated using primarily third party appraisals or the discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions of the future expected cash flows change  we may be required to record an impairment in the future 

table of contents reserve contingencies for litigation and other matters in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of reasonably possible obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimation process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates and adjustments to income could be required 
stock based compensation we have a number of equity based compensation awards issued to certain employees  including restricted stock units rsus  and stock options with tandem stock appreciation rights sars  and deferred stock units dsus  issued to our directors under our non employee director deferred stock unit plan 
of these  determining the fair value of stock options with tandem sars and the related stock based compensation expense is subject to significant judgment and estimates 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to value outstanding stock options  which requires the use of subjective assumptions  such as the estimated length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them the expected term  which is based on historical experience  and the expected volatility of our common share price over the expected term  which is estimated using the company s historical share price volatility for a period similar to the expected term 
stock options are generally granted with tandem sars  although sars may also be granted alone 
a sar related to an option terminates upon the expiration  forfeiture  or exercise of the related option  and is exercisable only to the extent that the related option is exercisable 
stock options with tandem sars allow the employee to exercise the stock option to receive common shares or to exercise the sar and receive a cash payment  in each case of a value equal to the difference between the market price of the share on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option 
the awards are accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period  and are expensed over the vesting period 
changes in subjective assumptions  as well as changes in the share price from period to period  can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount of compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
impact of accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in july  the securities and exchange commission published its final staff report on the potential incorporation of international financial reporting standards ifrs  a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb  into the us financial reporting system 
this staff report did not include a recommendation on whether  how  or when ifrs should be incorporated 
we continue to monitor the impact of the adoption of fasb iasb joint projects would have on our consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and disclosures  and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 
further  although canadian securities laws generally require canadian reporting issuers to apply ifrs beginning in fiscal  national instrument acceptable accounting principles and auditing standards permits issuers like us that have a class of securities registered under section of the us securities exchange act of  as amended  the exchange act or are required to file reports under section d of the exchange act and which are not registered or required to be registered as an investment company under the us investment company act of  as amended  to elect to prepare financial statements that are filed with or delivered to a securities regulatory authority or regulator other than acquisition statements in accordance with us gaap 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and inflation 
in accordance with our policies  we manage our exposure to these various market based risks 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
our primary foreign exchange exposure is attributed to us dollar purchases and payments made by canadian operations 
net cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were approximately million for fiscal we are also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on the translation of our us operating results into canadian dollars for reporting purposes 
while these fluctuations are not significant to the consolidated operating results  the exchange rate fluctuation does impact our us segment operating results and can affect the comparability quarter over quarter and year over year 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on the revaluation of foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the canadian dollar functional currency entities 
the gains and losses associated with the revaluation of the foreign currency assets and liabilities are included in other income and expense 
the company uses foreign exchange derivative products to manage the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on us dollar purchases and payments  such as coffee and certain intercompany purchases  made by the canadian operations 
forward currency contracts associated with managing this risk  to sell canadian dollars and buy us million and us million  were outstanding as at december  and january   respectively 
the fair value unrealized loss on these forward contracts was million as at december   compared to an unrealized gain million as at january  we do not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
the company has a policy forbidding speculating in foreign currency 
by their nature  derivative financial instruments involve risk  including the credit risk of non performance by counterparties 
as a result  our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
in order to minimize counterparty credit risk  the company uses multiple investment grade financial institutions and limits the notional amount available for each counterparty 
we have reviewed the counterparty risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
at the current level of annual operating income generated from the us operations and current us dollar cash flow exposures  if the us currency rate changes by for the entire year  the annual impact on our net income and annual cash flows would not be material 
commodity risk we purchase certain products such as coffee  wheat  edible oils and sugar and other prepared products  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices in the normal course of business 
therefore  we are exposed to some price volatility related to weather and  more importantly  various other market conditions outside of our control 
however  we do employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally  these techniques include setting fixed prices for periods of up to one year with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future  and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
we purchase a significant amount of green coffee and typically have purchase commitments fixing the price for a month period depending upon prevailing market conditions 
we also typically hedge against the risk of foreign exchange on green coffee prices at the same time 
we do not make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of our other contract pricing techniques outlined above 
as we make purchases beyond our current commitments  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions at such time 
generally  
table of contents increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to restaurant owners  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
we and our restaurant owners have some ability to increase product pricing to offset a rise in commodity prices  subject to the respective acceptance by restaurant owners and customers 
these cost and pricing changes can impact revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
see item a 
risk factors increases in the cost of commodities or decreases in the availability of commodities could have an adverse impact on our restaurant owners and on our business and financial results 
interest rate risk in fiscal  we issued million of senior notes  which were offered on a private placement basis in canada with a term of years 
net proceeds from the senior notes were primarily used to prepay million of our existing term debt  prior to maturity 
the senior notes bear a fixed coupon interest rate of  and an effective rate of resulting from the settlement of interest rate forwards used to hedge the interest rate prior to the issuance of the first portion of the senior notes  the premium recorded on the subsequent issue of senior notes  and the deferred financing fees associated with the issuances 
in december  the ad fund entered into a million year term loan bearing interest of banker s acceptance fee plus an applicable margin related to the expanded menu board program 
in february  the ad fund entered into an amortizing interest rate swap to fix a portion of the interest expense on the term loan 
as our cash is invested in short term variable rate instruments  we are now exposed on a net basis to interest rate movements on a net asset position when historically we have been exposed on a net liability position 
if interest rates change by basis points  the impact on our annual net income would not be material 
we have a million revolving bank facility that was undrawn at the end of fiscal  other than to support standby letters of credit 
the ad fund has a million credit facility that was undrawn at the end of fiscal to support the expanded menu board program 
if we were to borrow on these facilities in the future  we may be exposed to interest rate risk on a net liability position at that time 
inflation consolidated financial statements determined on an historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for our business inventories approximate current market prices  property holdings at fixed costs are substantial  and there is some ability to adjust prices 
however  if several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time  such as commodity price increases beyond our ability to control and increased labour costs  we and our restaurant owners may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand
