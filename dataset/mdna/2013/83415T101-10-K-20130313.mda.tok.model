item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
risks related to our business and industry we have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses to date  anticipate continuing to incur losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we are an early stage company with a limited operating history 
we only recently began commercializing our products 
a substantial portion of our revenues consists of funding from third party collaborative research agreements and government grants 
we have only generated limited revenues from commercial sales  which have been principally derived from sales of our nutrition and skin and personal care products 
although we expect a significant portion of our future revenues to come from commercial sales in the chemicals and fuels markets  only a small portion of our revenues to date has been generated from market development activities 
we have not yet commercialized any of our oils in the chemicals market 
we have incurred substantial net losses since our inception  including net loss attributable to our common stockholders of million during the year ended december  we expect these losses may continue as we expand our manufacturing capacity and build out our product pipeline 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business  including research and development  the build out and operation of our peoria facility  the construction and operation of the solazyme bunge jv production facility described below  the retrofitting of the clinton facility described below and other commercial facilities 
as a result  our annual operating losses may continue in the short term 
we  along with our development and commercialization partners  will need to develop products successfully  produce them in large quantities cost effectively  and market and sell them profitably 
if our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will not become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we fail to become profitable  or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses  we may be unable to continue our business operations 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability 
we have generated limited revenues from the sale of our products  and our business may fail if we are not able to successfully commercialize these products 
we have had only limited product sales to date 
if we are not successful in further advancing our existing commercial arrangements with strategic partners  developing new arrangements  or otherwise increasing our 
table of contents manufacturing capacity and securing reliable access to sufficient volumes of low cost  feedstock  we will be unable to generate meaningful revenues from our products 
we are subject to the substantial risk of failure facing businesses seeking to develop products based on a new technology 
certain factors that could  alone or in combination  prevent us from successfully commercializing our products include our ability to secure reliable access to sufficient volumes of low cost feedstock  our ability to achieve commercial scale production of our products on a cost effective basis and in a timely manner  technical challenges with our production processes or with development of new products that we are not able to overcome  our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with development  feedstock  manufacturing and commercialization partners  our ability to gain market acceptance of our products with customers and maintain customer relationships  our ability to manage our growth  our ability to secure and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for the production  distribution and sale of our products and to comply with applicable laws and regulations  actions of direct and indirect competitors that may seek to enter the markets in which we expect to compete or that may seek to impose barriers to one or more markets that we intend to target  and public concerns about the ethical  legal  environmental and social ramifications of the use of targeted recombinant technology  land use and diversion of resources from food production 
the production of our microalgae based oils and bioproducts requires fermentable feedstock 
the inability to obtain feedstock in sufficient quantities or in a timely and cost effective manner may limit our ability to produce our products 
a critical component of the production of our oils and bioproducts is access to feedstock in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable price to enable commercial production and sale 
other than as described below  we currently purchase feedstock  such as sugarcane based sucrose and corn based dextrose  for the production of our products at prevailing market prices 
we are currently in discussions with additional potential feedstock partners 
except for the supply of feedstock to solazyme roquette nutritionals  llc solazyme roquette nutritionals  or the solazyme roquette jv for nutrition products by our partner  roquette fr res  sa roquette  to solazyme bunge produtos renov veis ltda 
solazyme bunge renewable oils or the solazyme bunge jv for triglyceride oil products for sale and use in brazil by our partner  bunge global innovation  llc and certain of its affiliates bunge  pursuant to joint venture arrangements  and to our strategic collaboration with archer daniels midland company adm solazyme adm collaboration at the adm fermentation facility in clinton  iowa clinton facility  we do not have any long term supply agreements or other guaranteed access to feedstock 
as we scale our production  we anticipate that the production of our oils for the chemicals and fuels markets will require large volumes of feedstock and we may not be able to contract with feedstock producers to secure sufficient quantities of feedstock at reasonable costs or at all 
for example  corn based dextrose feedstock for the clinton facility will be provided from adm s adjacent wet mill and sugarcane based sucrose for the solazyme bunge jv facility in moema  brazil will be provided by bunge 
corn and sugar are traded as commodities and are subject to price volatility 
while we will seek to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of sugar and corn based dextrose by entering into hedging transactions  we may not be successful in doing so 
if we cannot access feedstock in the quantities we need at acceptable prices  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our chemicals and fuels products  and our business will suffer 
we are currently negotiating with additional potential feedstock partners in latin america and the united states 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully execute additional long term feedstock contracts on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we do not succeed in entering into long term supply contracts  successfully hedge against our 
table of contents exposure to fluctuations in the price of feedstock or otherwise procure feedstock as and when needed  our revenues and profit margins may fluctuate from period to period as we will remain subject to prevailing market prices 
although our plan is to enter into partnerships  such as the solazyme bunge jv and the solazyme adm collaboration  with feedstock providers to supply the feedstock necessary to produce our products  we cannot predict the future availability or price of such feedstock or be sure that our feedstock partners will be able to supply such feedstock in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner 
the prices of feedstock depend on numerous factors outside of our or our partners control  including weather conditions  government programs and regulations  changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living  rising or falling commodities and equities markets  and availability of credit to producers 
crop yields and sugar content depend on weather conditions such as rainfall and temperature 
variable weather conditions have historically caused volatility in feedstock crop prices due to crop failures or reduced harvests 
for example  excessive rainfall can adversely affect the supply of feedstock available for the production of our products by reducing the sucrose content of feedstock and limiting growers ability to harvest 
crop disease and pestilence can also occur from time to time and can adversely affect feedstock crop growth  potentially rendering useless or unusable all or a substantial portion of affected harvests 
the limited amount of time during which feedstock crops keep their sugar content after harvest poses a risk of spoilage 
also  the fact that many feedstock crops are not themselves traded commodities limits our ability to substitute supply in the event of such an occurrence 
if our ability to obtain feedstock crops is adversely affected by these or other conditions  our ability to produce our products will be impaired  and our business will be adversely affected 
in the near term we believe brazilian sugarcane based sucrose will be an important feedstock for us 
along with the risks described above  brazilian sugarcane prices may also increase due to  among other things  changes in the criteria set by the conselho dos produtores de cana  a car e lcool council of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol producers  known as consecana 
consecana is an industry association of producers of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol that sets market terms and prices for general supply  lease and partnership agreements and may change such prices and terms from time to time 
moreover  brazil has a developed industry for producing ethanol from sugarcane  and if we have manufacturing operations in brazil that do not have a partner providing the sugarcane feedstock  such as bunge as part of the solazyme bunge jv  we will need to compete for sugarcane feedstock with ethanol producers 
such changes and competition could result in higher sugarcane prices and or a significant decrease in the volume of sugarcane available for the production of our products  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have entered into  and plan to enter into other  arrangements with feedstock producers to co locate oil production at their existing mills  and if we are not able to complete and execute on these arrangements in a timely manner and on terms favorable to us  our business will be adversely affected 
in april  we entered into a joint venture agreement with bunge  forming the solazyme bunge jv which is doing business as solazyme bunge renewable oils 
the solazyme bunge jv intends to produce triglyceride oils in brazil for sale into the brazilian market using our proprietary technology and sugarcane feedstock provided by bunge 
the solazyme bunge jv production facility will be located adjacent to a sugarcane processing mill in brazil that is owned by bunge 
the acquisition of the facility site by the solazyme bunge jv is in process 
the construction of the solazyme bunge jv s production facility began in june and we are targeting start up of the facility in the fourth quarter of in addition  in may  we entered a joint development agreement with bunge that advances our work on brazilian sugarcane feedstocks and extends through may in may  we entered into a warrant agreement  amended in august  with bunge limited that vests upon the successful completion of milestones that ultimately target the completion of construction of the solazyme bunge jv facility in with a nameplate capacity of  metric tons of output oil in we intend to continue to expand our manufacturing capacity by entering into additional agreements with feedstock producers that require them to invest some or all of the capital needed to build new production facilities to produce our oils 
in return  we expect to share in profits anticipated to be realized from the sale of these products 
we are currently negotiating with additional potential feedstock partners in latin america and the united states 

table of contents in november  we and adm entered into a strategic collaboration agreement collaboration agreement  establishing the solazyme adm collaboration for the production of tailored triglyceride oil products at the clinton facility 
the clinton facility will produce tailored triglyceride oil products using our proprietary microbe based catalysis technology 
feedstock for the facility will be provided from adm s adjacent wet mill 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we agreed to pay adm annual fees for use and operation of the clinton facility  a portion of which may be paid in our common stock 
in addition  we have granted to adm a warrant covering  shares of our common stock  which vests in equal monthly installments over five years  commencing from the start of commercial production 
we currently anticipate that commercial production at the clinton facility will begin by early the initial target nameplate capacity of the facility is expected to be  metric tons per year of tailored triglyceride oil products 
we have an option to expand the capacity to  metric tons per year  with the goal to further expand production to  metric tons per year 
there can be no assurance that commercial production at the clinton facility will commence on the anticipated timeline or that we will expand the capacity of the facility 
the parties will also work together to develop markets for the products produced at the clinton facility 
there can be no assurance that a sufficient number of other sugar or other feedstock mill owners will accept the opportunity to partner with us for the production of our oils 
reluctance on the part of mill owners may be caused  for example  by their failure to understand our technology or product opportunities or their belief that greater economic benefits can be achieved from partnering with others 
mill owners may also be reluctant or unable to obtain needed capital  alternatively  if mill owners are able to obtain debt financing  we may be required to provide a guarantee 
limitations in the credit markets  such as those experienced in the recent economic downturn or historically in developing nations as a result of government monetary policies designed in response to very high rates of inflation  would impede or prevent this kind of financing and could adversely affect our ability to develop the production capacity needed to allow us to grow our business 
mill owners may also be limited by existing contractual obligations with other third parties  liability  health and safety concerns and additional maintenance  training  operating and other ongoing expenses 
even if additional feedstock partners are willing to co locate our oil production at their mills  they may do so only on economic terms that place more of the cost  or confer less of the economic return  on us than we currently anticipate 
if we are not successful in negotiations with mill owners  our cost of securing additional manufacturing capacity may be higher than anticipated in terms of up front costs  capital expenditure or lost future returns  and we may not gain the manufacturing capacity that we need to grow our business 
our pursuit of new product opportunities may not be technologically feasible or cost effective  which would limit our ability to expand our product line and sources of revenues 
we intend to commit substantial resources  alone or with collaboration partners  to the development and analysis of new tailored oils by applying recombinant technology to our microalgae strains 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in creating new tailored oil profiles that we  our partners or their customers desire 
there are significant technological hurdles in successfully applying recombinant technology to microalgae  and if we are unsuccessful at engineering microalgae strains that produce desirable tailored oils  the number and size of the markets we will be able to address will be limited  our expected profit margins could be reduced and the potential profitability of our business could be compromised 
the successful development of our business depends on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively produce microalgae based oils at large commercial scale 
two of the significant drivers of our production costs are the level of productivity and conversion yield of our microalgae strains 
productivity is principally a function of the amount of oil that can be obtained from a given volume over a particular time period 
conversion yield refers to the amount of the desired oil that can be produced from a fixed amount of feedstock 
we may not be able to meet our currently expected production cost profile as we bring large commercial manufacturing capacity online 
if we cannot do so  our business would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents production of both current and future oils will require that our technology and processes be scalable from laboratory  pilot and demonstration projects to large commercial scale production 
we do not have experience constructing or managing large  commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
we may not have identified all of the factors that could affect our manufacturing processes 
our technology may not perform as expected when applied at large commercial scale  or we may encounter operational challenges for which we are unable to identify a workable solution 
for example  contamination in the production process  problems with plant utilities  human error  issues arising from process modifications to reduce costs and adjust product specifications  and other similar challenges could decrease process efficiency  create delays and increase our costs 
to date we have employed our technology using fermenters with a capacity of up to  liters  and recently achieved scaled yields at fermenters with a capacity of approximately  liters 
however  we still need to reproduce our commercial productivity at fermenters with a capacity of  liters  and our commercial productivity and yields using fermenters with a capacity of approximately  liters 
we may not be able to scale up our production in a timely manner  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to manufacture products at a large commercial scale  our ability to commercialize our technology will be adversely affected  and  with respect to any products that we do bring to market  we may not be able to achieve and maintain an acceptable production cost profile  which would adversely affect our ability to reach  maintain and increase the profitability of our business 
we rely in part on third parties for the production and processing of our products 
if these parties do not produce and process our products at a satisfactory quality  in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  our development and commercialization efforts could be delayed or otherwise negatively impacted 
other than our peoria facility  we do not own facilities that can produce and process our products other than at small scale 
as such  we rely  and we expect to continue to rely  at least partially  on third parties including partners and contract manufacturers for the production and processing of our products 
to date  we have entered into three manufacturing arrangements for industrial fermentation the manufacture of nutrition products for solazyme roquette nutritionals by our partner roquette  the future manufacture of certain triglyceride oil products by the solazyme bunge jv  in each case pursuant to joint venture arrangements  and the future manufacture of tailored triglyceride oil products at the clinton facility 
we also have manufacturing agreements relating to other aspects of our production process 
our current and anticipated future dependence upon our partners and contract manufacturers for the production and processing of our products may adversely affect our ability to develop products on a timely and competitive basis 
the failure of any of our counterparties to provide acceptable products could delay the development and commercialization of our products 
we or our partners will need to enter into additional agreements for the commercial development  manufacturing and sale of our products 
there can be no assurance that we or our partners can do so on favorable terms  if at all 
even if we reach agreements with manufacturing partners to produce and process our products  initially the partners will be unfamiliar with our technology and production processes 
we cannot be sure that the partners will have or develop the operational expertise needed to run the additional equipment and processes required to manufacture our products 
further  we may have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that any partner is able or willing to devote to production and processing of our products 
to date  our products have been produced and processed in quantities sufficient for our development work 
for example  we delivered more than  liters metric tons of microalgae derived military marine diesel and jet fuel to the us navy in even if there is demand for our products at a commercial scale  we or our partners may not be able to successfully increase the production capacity for any of our products in a timely or economic manner or at all 
in addition  to the extent we are relying on contract manufacturers to produce and process our products  we cannot be sure that such contract manufacturers will have capacity available when we need their services  that they will be willing to dedicate a portion of their production and or processing capacity to our products or that we will be able to reach acceptable price and other terms with them for the provision of their production and or processing services 
if we  our partners or our contract manufacturers are unable to increase the production capacity for a product when and as needed  the commercial launch of that product may be delayed  or there may be a shortage of supply  which could limit sales  cause us to lose customers and sales opportunities and impair the growth of our business 

table of contents in addition  if a facility or the equipment in a facility that produces and or processes our products is significantly damaged  destroyed or otherwise becomes unavailable  we or our partners may be unable to replace the manufacturing capacity quickly or cost effectively 
the inability to obtain manufacturing agreements  the damage or destruction of a facility upon which we or our partners rely for manufacturing or any other delays in obtaining supply would delay or prevent us and or our partners from further developing and commercializing our products 
we may experience significant delays in financing  designing and constructing large commercial manufacturing facilities  which could result in harm to our business and prospects 
our business plan contemplates bringing significant commercial manufacturing capacity online over the next several years 
in order to meet our capital requirements for those facilities  we may have to raise additional funds and may be unable to do so in a timely manner  in sufficient amounts and on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds  our ability to finance and construct additional manufacturing facilities could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay the commercialization of our products and we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan  which would harm our business 
the solazyme bunge jv is currently constructing an oil production facility adjacent to bunge s moema sugarcane mill in brazil 
we are targeting start up of the facility in the fourth quarter of the acquisition of the facility site is in process 
the production facility is expected to have a name plate capacity of  metric tons per year of oil 
in february  the solazyme bunge jv entered a loan agreement with the brazilian development bank bndes for project financing 
funds borrowed under the loan agreement will support the production facility in brazil  including a portion of the construction costs of the facility 
as a condition of the solazyme bunge jv drawing funds under the loan  we will be required to guarantee a portion of the loan in an amount not to exceed our ownership percentage in the solazyme bunge jv 
negotiating the terms of the loan documentation including the required guarantee may take longer than anticipated and may contain terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are unable to negotiate our loan documents on acceptable terms  the solazyme bunge jv will be unable to draw down amounts under the loan  will have to seek additional financing and may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
if the solazyme bunge jv is unable to secure additional financing  we will be required to fund our portion of the solazyme bunge jv s capital requirements either from existing sources or seek additional financing 
if the solazyme bunge jv is unable to acquire the facility site on reasonable terms  or at all  it may not be able to operate the oil production facility and may lose all or part of its investment in such facility 
furthermore  we will need to construct  or otherwise secure access to  and fund  additional capacity significantly greater than what we are in the process of building as we continue to commercialize our products 
we aim to commence production of oils for the chemicals and fuels markets at the solazyme bunge jv facility in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate commercial production at the clinton facility to begin by early and we expect to bring online additional facilities thereafter 
although we intend to enter into arrangements with third parties to meet our capacity targets  it is possible that we will need to construct our own facility or facilities to meet a portion or all of these targets 
we have limited experience in the construction of commercial production facilities and  if we decide to construct our own facility  we will need to secure necessary funding  complete design and other plans needed for the construction of such facility and secure the requisite permits  licenses and other governmental approvals  and we may not be successful in doing so 
the construction of any such facility would have to be completed on a timely basis and within an acceptable budget 
in addition  there may be delays related to the acquisition of facility sites  which would delay the development and commercialization of our products 
any facility  whether owned by a third party or by us  must perform as designed once it is operational 
if we encounter significant delays  cost overruns  engineering problems  equipment supply constraints or other serious challenges in bringing any of these facilities online  we may be unable to meet our production goals in the time frame we have planned 
in addition  we have limited experience in the management of manufacturing operations at large scale 
we may not be successful in producing the amount and quality of oil or bioproduct we anticipate 
table of contents in such plant and our results of operations may suffer as a result 
we have limited experience producing our products at commercial scale  and we will not succeed if we cannot maintain or decrease our production costs and effectively scale our technology and manufacturing processes 
if we fail to maintain and successfully manage our existing  or enter into new  strategic collaborations  we may not be able to develop and commercialize many of our products and achieve or sustain profitability 
our ability to enter into  maintain and manage collaborations in our target markets is fundamental to the success of our business 
we currently have joint venture agreements  collaboration agreements  research and development agreements  supply agreements and or distribution agreements with various strategic partners 
we currently rely on our partners  in part  for manufacturing and sales or marketing services and intend to continue to do so for the foreseeable future  and we intend to enter into other strategic collaborations to produce  market and sell other products we develop 
however  we may not be successful in entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties for the production and sale and marketing of other products 
any failure to enter into collaborative arrangements on favorable terms could delay or hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products and could increase our costs of development and commercialization 
in the chemicals and fuels markets  we have entered into a joint venture arrangement with bunge that will focus on the production of triglyceride oils in brazil for sale in the brazilian market  and development agreements with bunge  unilever and the dow chemical company dow 
we have entered into a joint venture with roquette in connection with our nutrition business 
in addition  we have entered into a strategic collaboration with adm for the production of tailored triglyceride oil products to be sold primarily to the industrial and nutritionals markets in north america 
in the skin and personal care market  we have entered into arrangements with sephora sa and its affiliates sephora  qvc  inc and others 
there can be no guarantee that we can successfully manage these strategic collaborations 
under our agreement with sephora  we bear a significant portion of the costs and risk of marketing the products  but do not exercise sole control of marketing strategy 
in some cases  we will need to meet certain milestones to continue our activities with these partners 
the exclusivity provisions of certain strategic arrangements limit our ability to otherwise commercialize our products 
pursuant to the agreements listed above and similar arrangements that we may enter into in the future  we may have limited or no control over the amount or timing of resources that any partner is able or willing to devote to our products or collaborative efforts 
any of our partners may fail to perform their obligations as expected 
these partners may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  our partners may not develop products arising out of our arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing  or sale of our products 
dependence on collaborative arrangements will also subject us to other risks  including we may be required to relinquish important rights  including intellectual property  marketing and distribution rights or may disagree with our partners as to rights to intellectual property we develop  or their research programs or commercialization activities  we may have lower revenues than if we were to market and distribute such products ourselves  a partner could separately develop and market a competing product either independently or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  our partners could become unable or less willing to expend their resources on research and development or commercialization efforts due to general market conditions  their financial condition or other circumstances beyond our control  we may be unable to manage multiple simultaneous partnerships or collaborations  and our partners may operate in countries where their operations could be adversely affected by changes in the local regulatory environment or by political unrest 

table of contents moreover  disagreements with a partner could develop  and any conflict with a partner could reduce our ability to enter into future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationships with one or more existing partners 
in addition  disagreements with a partner could result in disputes or litigation and could require substantial time and money to resolve 
if any of these events occur  or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our partners  we may not be able to commercialize our existing and potential products  grow our business or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
additionally  our business could be negatively impacted if any of our partners undergoes a change of control or were to otherwise assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements to a competitor of ours or to a third party who is not willing to work with us on the same terms or commit the same resources as the current partner 
our relationship with our strategic partner adm may not prove successful 
we have entered into the solazyme adm collaboration  which will focus on the production of tailored triglyceride oil products at the clinton facility 
the clinton facility will produce tailored triglyceride oil products using our proprietary microbe based catalysis technology 
feedstock for the facility will be provided from adm s adjacent wet mill 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we will pay adm annual fees for use and operation of the clinton facility  a portion of which may be paid in our common stock 
our ability to generate value from the solazyme adm collaboration will depend  among other things  on our ability to work cooperatively with adm for the production of tailored triglyceride oil products at the clinton facility 
we may not be able to do so 
for example  under the solazyme adm collaboration  adm has agreed to provide feedstock and utility services to the clinton facility as well as operating services 
adm does not have previous experience working with our technology  and we cannot be sure that adm will be successful in producing our tailored triglyceride oil products in amounts we may require  at a satisfactory quality and or in a cost effective manner 
subject to limited exceptions and adjustments  we will be responsible for annual fees regardless of adm s success in producing our tailored triglyceride oil products in acceptable quantities  at satisfactory quality and at acceptable costs 
in addition  there may be delays related to the retrofitting and permitting of the clinton facility  which would delay the production and commercialization of our tailored triglyceride oil products 
furthermore  the agreements governing our solazyme adm collaboration are complex and cover a range of future activities  and disputes may arise between us and adm that could delay the production and commercialization of our tailored triglyceride oil products or cause the termination of the solazyme adm collaboration 
our relationship with our strategic partner bunge may not prove successful 
we have entered into a joint venture with bunge that will focus on the production of certain triglyceride oils in brazil for sale into brazilian markets 
in connection with the establishment of the solazyme bunge jv  we entered into a development agreement and other agreements with bunge and the solazyme bunge jv 
our ability to generate value from the solazyme bunge jv will depend  among other things  on our ability to work cooperatively with bunge and the solazyme bunge jv for the commercialization of the solazyme bunge jv s products 
we may not be able to do so 
for example  under the joint venture  bunge has agreed to provide feedstock as well as utility services to the production facility 
we and bunge have both agreed to provide various administrative services to the solazyme bunge jv  and bunge will also provide working capital to the solazyme bunge jv through a revolving loan facility  with a portion of the repayment for start up expenses to be guaranteed by us 
bunge does not have previous experience working with our technology  and we cannot be sure that the solazyme bunge jv will be successful in commercializing its products 
in addition  there may be delays related to the acquisition of the facility site and construction of the solazyme bunge jv production facility 
there may also be delays in our negotiation of the loan guarantee to be entered into as a condition of the solazyme bunge jv drawing down amounts under the loan agreement with bndes 
any of these events would delay the development and commercialization of the solazyme bunge jv products 
furthermore  the agreements 
table of contents governing our partnership are complex and cover a range of future activities  and disputes may arise between us and bunge that could delay completion of the solazyme bunge jv facility and or the expansion of the solazyme bunge jv s capacity and the development and commercialization of the solazyme bunge jv s products or cause the dissolution of the solazyme bunge jv 
our relationship with our strategic partner roquette may not prove successful 
we have entered into a joint venture with roquette  one of the world s largest starch and starch derivatives companies 
as part of this relationship  we and roquette formed solazyme roquette nutritionals  through which both we and roquette will conduct a substantial portion of our business in connection with microalgae based oils and bioproducts for the food  nutraceuticals and animal feed markets 
in connection with the establishment of the solazyme roquette jv  we have entered into services  manufacturing and license agreements with roquette and solazyme roquette nutritionals 
our ability to generate value from the solazyme roquette jv will depend on  among other things  our ability to work cooperatively with roquette and solazyme roquette nutritionals for the commercialization of the solazyme roquette jv s products 
we may not be able to do so 
for example  under the joint venture  roquette personnel and facilities will be used to produce nutrition products using our licensed technology 
roquette does not have previous experience working with our technology  and we cannot be sure that the solazyme roquette jv will be successful in commercializing its products 
in addition  the agreements governing our partnership are complex and cover a range of future activities  and disputes may arise between us and roquette that could delay the development and commercialization of the solazyme roquette jv s products or cause the dissolution of the solazyme roquette jv 
for example  the joint venture agreement contemplates that roquette will construct and own two solazyme roquette jv dedicated facilities that are expected to have aggregate capacity of approximately  metric tons per year 
in addition  subject to approval of the board of directors of the solazyme roquette jv to enter into phase  roquette has committed to fund a solazyme roquette jv owned facility in phase that is expected to have capacity of approximately  metric tons per year 
however  because the four person board of directors of the solazyme roquette jv includes two roquette designees  the decision to proceed with phase will functionally require roquette s approval 
if we are unable to obtain the approval of the board of directors of the solazyme roquette jv  our ability to commercialize the solazyme roquette jv s nutrition products and the financial performance of the solazyme roquette jv will suffer 
we cannot be sure that our products will meet necessary standards or be approved or accepted by customers in our target markets 
if we are unable to convince our potential customers or end users of our products that we are a reliable supplier  that our products are comparable or superior to the products that they currently use  or that the use of our products is otherwise beneficial to them  we will not be successful in entering our target markets and our business will be adversely affected 
in the chemicals market  the potential customers for our or the solazyme bunge jv s oils are generally companies that have well developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers for the chemical components of their products and may resist changing these processes and components 
these potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers  influenced by consumer preference  manufacturing considerations  supplier operating history  regulatory issues  product liability and other factors  many of which are unknown to  or not well understood by  us 
satisfying these processes may take many months or years 
although we produce products for the fuels market that comply with industry specifications  potential fuels customers may be reluctant to adopt new products due to a lack of familiarity with our oils 
in addition  our fuels may need to satisfy product certification requirements of equipment manufacturers 
for example  diesel engine manufacturers may need to certify that the use of diesel fuels produced from our oils in their equipment will not invalidate product warranties 

table of contents in the nutrition market  our solazyme roquette jv s products will compete with oils and other food ingredients currently in use 
potential customers may not perceive a benefit to microalgae based products as compared to existing ingredients or may be otherwise unwilling to adopt their use 
if consumer packaged goods cpg companies do not accept the solazyme roquette jv s products as ingredients for their widely distributed finished products  or if end customers are unwilling to purchase finished products made using the solazyme roquette jv s oils or bioproducts  the solazyme roquette jv will not be successful in competing in the nutrition market and our business will be adversely affected 
in the skin and personal care market  our branded products are marketed directly to potential consumers  but we cannot be sure that consumers will continue to be attracted to our brand or purchase our products on an ongoing basis 
as a result  our distribution partners may decide to discontinue marketing our products 
we have entered into contingent offtake agreements and non binding letters of intent with third parties regarding purchase of our products  but these agreements do not unconditionally obligate the other party to purchase any quantities of any products at this time 
there can be no assurance that our contingent offtake agreements and non binding letters of intent will lead to unconditional definitive agreements to purchase our products 
we have limited experience in structuring arrangements with customers for the purchase of our microalgae based products  and we may not be successful in this essential aspect of our business 
we expect that our customers will include large companies that sell skin and personal care products  food products and chemical products  as well as large users of oils for fuels 
because we have only recently begun to commercialize our skin and personal care products and  through solazyme roquette nutritionals  nutrition products  and are still in the process of developing our products for the chemicals and fuels markets  we have limited experience operating in our customers industries and interacting with the customers that we intend to target 
developing the necessary expertise may take longer than we expect and will require that we expand and improve our marketing capability  which could be costly 
these activities could delay our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe our technology and products present  and may prevent us from successfully commercializing our products 
further  we ultimately aim to sell large amounts of our oils and bioproducts to certain customers  and this will require that we effectively negotiate and manage contracts for these purchase and sale relationships 
the companies with which we aim to have arrangements are generally much larger than we are and have substantially longer operating histories and more experience in their industries than we have 
as a result  we may not succeed in establishing relationships with these companies and  if we do  we may not be effective in negotiating or managing the terms of such relationships  which could adversely affect our future results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims and other claims of our customers and partners 
the design  development  production and sale of our oils and bioproducts involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
because some of our ultimate products in each of our target markets are used by consumers  and because use of those ultimate products may cause injury to those consumers and damage to property  we are subject to a risk of claims for such injuries and damages 
in addition  we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to our oils  bioproducts or the ultimate products  even for defects resulting from errors of our partners  contract manufacturers or other third parties working with our products 
these claims could be brought by various parties  including customers who are purchasing products directly from us or other users who purchase products from our customers or partners 
we could also be named as co parties in product liability suits that are brought against manufacturing partners that produce our products 
in addition  our customers and partners may bring suits against us alleging damages for the failure of our products to meet specifications or other requirements 
any such suits  even if not successful  could be costly  disrupt the attention of our management and damage our negotiations with other partners and or customers 

table of contents although we often seek to limit our product liability in our contracts  such limits may not be enforceable or may be subject to exceptions 
our current product liability and umbrella insurance for our business may be inadequate to cover all potential liability claims 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain 
also  insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms and may not be sufficient to cover potential claims 
we cannot be sure that our contract manufacturers or manufacturing partners who produce our ultimate products will have adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims 
if we experience a large insured loss  it might exceed our coverage limits  or our insurance carrier may decline to further cover us or may raise our insurance rates to unacceptable levels  any of which could impair our financial position and potentially cause us to go out of business 
we will face risks associated with our international business in developing countries and elsewhere 
for the foreseeable future  our business plan will likely subject us to risks associated with essential manufacturing  sales and operations in developing countries 
we have limited experience to date manufacturing and selling internationally and such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures  including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities  in advance of generating any revenue 
the economies of many of the countries in which we will operate have been characterized by frequent and occasionally extensive government intervention and unstable economic cycles 
in addition  in brazil  where the solazyme bunge jv is located  there are restrictions on the foreign ownership of land 
as a result  the process for the acquisition by the solazyme bunge jv of the facility site may be long  complicated and is subject to government approvals 
international business operations are subject to local legal  political  regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions and our business  financial performance and prospects may be adversely affected by  among others  the following factors political  economic  diplomatic or social instability  land reform movements  tariffs  export or import restrictions  restrictions on remittances abroad or repatriation of profits  duties or taxes that limit our ability to move our products out of these countries or interfere with the import of essential materials into these countries  inflation  changing interest rates and exchange controls  tax burden and policies  delays or failures in securing licenses  permits or other governmental approvals necessary to build and operate facilities and use our microalgae strains to produce products  the imposition of limitations on products or processes and the production or sale of those products or processes  uncertainties relating to foreign laws  including labor laws  regulations and restrictions  and legal proceedings  foreign ownership rules and changes in regard thereto  an inability  or reduced ability  to protect our intellectual property  including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action  successful compliance with us and foreign laws that regulate the conduct of business abroad  including the foreign corrupt practices act  insufficient investment in developing countries in public infrastructure  including transportation infrastructure  and disruption of transportation and logistics services  and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations 

table of contents these and other factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations may expose us to the risk of fluctuation in currency exchange rates and rates of foreign inflation  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently incur some costs and expenses in euros and brazilian reais and expect in the future to incur additional expenses in these and other foreign currencies  and also derive a portion of our revenues in the local currencies of customers throughout the world 
as a result  our revenues and results of operations are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations  which we may not be able to manage successfully 
during the past few decades  the brazilian currency in particular has faced frequent and substantial exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
in  the real depreciated against the us dollar  and in  the real depreciated against the us dollar 
the euro depreciated against the us dollar in and appreciated against the us dollar in there can be no assurance that the real or the euro will not significantly appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar in the future 
we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in the foreign countries where we incur costs and expenses or the decline in value of the us dollar compared to those foreign currencies will increase our costs as expressed in us dollars 
future measures by foreign governments to control inflation  including interest rate adjustments  intervention in the foreign exchange market and changes to the fixed value of their currencies  may trigger increases in inflation 
we may not be able to adjust the prices of our products to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structure  which could increase our costs and reduce our net operating margins 
if we do not successfully manage these risks through hedging or other mechanisms  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may encounter difficulties managing our growth  and we will need to properly prioritize our efforts in three distinct target markets as our business grows 
if we are unable to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our business has grown rapidly 
continued growth may place a strain on our human and capital resources 
furthermore  we intend to conduct our business internationally and anticipate business operations in the united states  europe  latin america and elsewhere 
these diversified  global operations place increased demands on our limited resources and may require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and will require us to attract  train  manage and retain qualified management  technicians  scientists and other personnel 
as our operations expand domestically and internationally  we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various customers  partners  suppliers and other third parties across several product categories and markets 
our growth is taking place across three distinct target markets chemicals and fuels  nutrition  and skin and personal care 
we will be required to prioritize our limited financial and managerial resources as we pursue particular development and commercialization efforts in each target market 
any resources we expend on one or more of these efforts could be at the expense of other potentially profitable opportunities 
if we focus our efforts and resources on one or more of these areas and they do not lead to commercially viable products  our revenues  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
furthermore  as our operations continue to grow  the simultaneous management of development  production and commercialization across all three target markets will become increasingly complex and may result in less than optimal allocation of management and other administrative resources  increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results 
our ability to effectively manage our operations  growth and various projects across our target markets will require us to make additional investments in our infrastructure to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees  which we may be unable to do effectively 
we may be unable to successfully manage our expenses in the future  which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating margins in any particular quarter 

table of contents in addition  we may not be able to improve our management information and control systems  including our internal control over financial reporting  to a level necessary to manage our growth and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls that we may not be able to remediate in an efficient or timely manner 
our success depends in part on recruiting and retaining key personnel and  if we fail to do so  it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy 
we are currently a small organization and will need to hire additional personnel to execute our business strategy successfully 
our success depends on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified management  business development  manufacturing and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions and scientists 
we are highly dependent upon a number of key members of our senior management  including manufacturing  business development and scientific personnel 
if any of such persons left  our business could be harmed 
all of our employees are at will employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could delay or have an impact on the successful commercialization of our products 
we do not maintain any key man insurance 
competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel 
if we are unsuccessful in our recruitment efforts  we may be unable to execute our strategy 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our microalgae based products and  even if approvals are obtained  complying on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to our various product categories will be time consuming and costly 
the sale and or use of diesel and jet fuels produced from our oils are subject to regulation by various government agencies  including the environmental protection agency epa and the california air resources board in the united states 
to date  we have registered only our soladiesel 
rd 
fuel in the united states 
we or our refining or commercialization partners or customers may be required to register our fuel in the united states  with the european commission and elsewhere before selling our products 
our chemical products may be subject to government regulation in our target markets 
in the united states  the epa administers the toxic substances control act tsca  which regulates the commercial registration  distribution  and use of chemicals 
tsca will require us to obtain and comply with the microbial commercial activity notice mcan process to manufacture and distribute products made from our recombinant microalgae strains 
to date  we have filed an mcan for one of our recombinant microalgae strains 
before we can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical  we need to determine whether that chemical is listed in the tsca inventory 
if the substance is listed  then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately 
if not  then a pre manufacture notice pmn must be filed with the epa for a review period of up to days excluding extensions 
we filed a pmn for oil derived from one of our recombinant microalgae strains  the review of which was completed by the epa in july we filed a pmn for oil derived from one of our non recombinant microalgae strains  the review of which was completed by the epa in december we also filed a pmn for algal biomass in december an mcan is not required for non recombinant microalgal strains 
some of the products we produce or plan to produce are already in the tsca inventory 
others are not yet listed 
we may not be able to expediently receive approval from the epa to list the chemicals we would like to make on the tsca registry  resulting in delays or significant increases in testing requirements 
a similar program exists in the european union  called reach registration  evaluation  authorization  and restriction of chemical substances 
we are required to register some of our products with the european commission  and this process could cause delays or significant costs 
we have determined that some of our algal oils are exempt from reach registration requirements 
to the extent that other geographies  such as brazil  may rely on the tsca or reach for chemical registration in their geographies  delays with the us or european authorities may subsequently delay entry into these markets as well 
furthermore  other geographies may have their own chemical inventory requirements  which may delay entry into these markets  irrespective of us or european approval 

table of contents our nutrition products are subject to regulation by various government agencies  including the us food and drug administration fda  state and local agencies and similar agencies outside the united states 
food ingredients and ingredients used in animal feed are regulated either as food additives or as substances generally recognized as safe  or gras 
a substance can be listed or affirmed as gras by the fda or self affirmed by its manufacturer upon determination that independent qualified experts would generally agree that the substance is gras for a particular use 
we have submitted to the fda our gras notice of determination for algal oil and received notification from the fda in june that it had no further questions 
our gras notice of determination for algal flour has been submitted to the fda 
we do not expect any objections upon their review 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not receive any objections from the fda to our notices of determination 
if the fda were to disagree with our determination  they could ask us to voluntarily withdraw the products from the market or could initiate legal action to halt their sale 
such actions by the fda could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of our operations 
food ingredients that are not gras are regulated as food additives and require fda approval prior to commercialization 
the food additive petition process is generally expensive and time consuming  with approval  if secured  taking years 
our skin and personal care products are subject to regulation by various government agencies both within and outside the united states 
such regulations principally relate to the ingredients  labeling  packaging and marketing of our skin and personal care products 
changes in regulatory requirements  laws and policies  or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements  laws and policies  may result in increased compliance costs  delays  capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results 
we expect to encounter regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to sell our products  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all 
if our microalgae based oils and bioproducts do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country or at all  then we may not be able to commercialize them and our business will be adversely affected 
the various regulatory schemes applicable to our products will continue to apply following initial approval for sale 
monitoring regulatory changes and ensuring our ongoing compliance with applicable requirements will be time consuming and may affect our results of operations 
if we fail to comply with such requirements on an ongoing basis  we may be subject to fines or other penalties  or may be prevented from selling our oils and bioproducts  and our business may be harmed 
we may incur significant costs complying with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and international laws and regulations governing  among other matters  the use  generation  manufacture  transportation  storage  handling  disposal of  and human exposure to  these materials both in the us and outside the us  including regulation by governmental regulatory agencies  such as the occupational safety and health administration and the epa 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations 
although we have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products in an effort to comply with these laws and regulations  we cannot be sure that our safety measures will be compliant or capable of eliminating the risk of injury or contamination from the generation  manufacturing  use  storage  transportation  handling  disposal of  and human exposure to  hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental  health and safety laws could subject us to liability and resulting damages 
there can be no assurance that violations of environmental  health and safety laws will not occur as a result of human error  accident  equipment failure or other causes 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and the failure to comply with past  present  or future laws could result in the imposition of fines  
table of contents regulatory oversight costs  third party property damage  product liability and personal injury claims  investigation and remediation costs  the suspension of production  or a cessation of operations  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
liability under environmental laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act in the united states  can impose liability for the full amount of damages  without regard to comparative fault for the investigation and cleanup of contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources 
contamination at properties we own and operate  and at properties to which we send hazardous materials  may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations 
our business and operations will be affected by other new environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  which may affect our research and development and manufacturing programs  and environmental laws could become more stringent over time  requiring us to change our operations  or resulting in greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations  which could impair our research  development or production efforts and harm our business 
the costs of complying with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and any claims concerning noncompliance  or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
changes in government regulations  including subsidies and economic incentives  could have a material adverse effect on demand for our oils  business and results of operations 
the market for renewable fuels is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies 
changes to existing  or adoption of new  domestic or foreign federal  state or local legislative initiatives that impact the production  distribution  sale or import and export of renewable fuels may harm our business 
for example  in  the energy independence and security act of set targets for alternative sourced liquid transportation fuels approximately billion gallons in  increasing to billion gallons by 
of the target amount  a minimum of billion gallons must be advanced biofuels 
in the us and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
the elimination of  or any reduction in  mandated requirements for fuel alternatives and additives to gasoline may cause demand for biofuels to decline and deter investment in the research and development of renewable fuels 
in addition  the us congress has passed legislation that extends tax credits to blenders of certain renewable fuel products 
however  there is no assurance that this or any other favorable legislation will remain in place 
for example  the biodiesel tax credit expired in december  and its extension was not approved until march any reduction in  phasing out or elimination of existing tax credits  subsidies and other incentives in the us and foreign markets for renewable fuels  or any inability of our customers to access such credits  subsidies and incentives  may adversely affect demand for our products and increase the overall cost of commercialization of our renewable fuels  which would adversely affect our business 
in addition  market uncertainty regarding future policies may also affect our ability to develop new renewable products or to license our technologies to third parties and to sell products to end customers 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  government programs could increase investment and competition in the markets for our oils 
for example  various governments have announced a number of spending programs focused on the development of clean technology  including alternatives to petroleum based fuels and the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions  which could lead to increased funding for us or our competitors  or the rapid increase in the number of competitors within our markets 
concerns associated with renewable fuels  including land usage  national security interests and food crop usage  are receiving legislative  industry and public attention 
this could result in future legislation  regulation and or administrative action that could adversely affect our business 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents future government policies may adversely affect the supply of sugarcane  corn or cellulosic sugars  restricting our ability to use these feedstocks to produce our oils  and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
we may face risks relating to the use of our targeted recombinant microalgae strains  and if we are not able to secure regulatory approval for the use of these strains or if we face material ethical  legal and social concerns about our use of targeted recombinant technology  our business could be adversely affected 
the use of microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology  such as some of our microalgae strains  is subject to laws and regulations in many states and countries  some of which are new and still evolving and interpreted by fact specific application 
in the united states  the epa regulates the commercial use of microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology as well as potential products derived from them 
we expect to encounter regulations of microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to establish manufacturing operations  and the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country 
for example  in the us  when used in an industrial process  our microalgae strains designed using targeted recombinant technology may be considered new chemicals under the tsca  administered by the epa 
we will be required to comply with the epa s microbial commercial activity notice process and are preparing to file a microbial commercial activity notice for the strain of optimized microalgae that we use for our chemicals and fuels businesses 
in brazil  microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology are regulated by the national biosafety technical commission  or ctnbio 
in march  we submitted an application for approval from ctnbio to use microalgae designed using targeted recombinant technology in a contained environment in order to use these microalgae for research and development and commercial production purposes in any facilities we establish in brazil 
if we cannot meet the applicable requirements in brazil and other countries in which we intend to produce microalgae based products  or if it takes longer than anticipated to obtain such approvals  our business could be adversely affected 
the subject of organisms designed using targeted recombinant technology has received negative publicity  which has aroused public debate 
public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of  and ethical concerns over  genetic research and microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology could influence public acceptance of our technology and products 
in addition  shifting public attitudes regarding  and potential changes to laws governing  ownership of genetic material could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage collaborators from supporting  developing  or commercializing our products  processes and technologies 
governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning organisms designed using targeted recombinant technology could result in greater government regulation of or trade restrictions on imports of genetic research and derivative products 
if we and or our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical  legal  and social concerns relating to the use of targeted recombinant technology  our products and processes may not be accepted or we could face increased expenses  delays or other impediments to their commercialization 
we expect to face competition for our oils in the chemicals and fuels markets from providers of products based on petroleum  plant oils and animal fats and from other companies seeking to provide alternatives to these products  many of whom have greater resources and experience than we do 
if we cannot compete effectively against these companies or products  we may not be successful in bringing our products to market or further growing our business 
in the chemical markets  we will compete with the established providers of oils currently used in chemical products 
producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies  including those selling agricultural products such as palm oil  palm kernel oil  castor bean oil and sunflower oil  large international chemical companies and other companies specializing in specific products or essential oils 
we may also compete in one or more of these markets with manufacturers of other products such as highly refined petrochemicals  synthetic polymers and other petroleum based fluids and lubricants as well as new market entrants offering renewable products 

table of contents in the transportation fuels market  we expect to compete with independent and integrated oil refiners  large oil and gas companies and  in certain fuels markets  with other companies producing advanced biofuels 
the refiners compete with us by selling conventional fuel products  and some are also pursuing hydrocarbon fuel production using non renewable feedstocks  such as natural gas and coal  as well as production using renewable feedstocks  such as vegetable oil and biomass 
we also expect to compete with companies that are developing the capacity to produce diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways 
these include advanced biofuels companies using specific engineered enzymes that they have developed to convert cellulosic biomass  which is non food plant material such as wood chips  corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse  into fermentable sugars and ultimately  renewable diesel and other fuels 
biodiesel companies convert vegetable oils and animal oils into diesel fuel and some are seeking to produce diesel and other transportation fuels using thermochemical methods to convert biomass into renewable fuels 
we believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemicals and fuels markets are product price  product performance  sustainability  availability of supply and compatibility of products with existing infrastructure 
the oil companies  large chemical companies and well established agricultural products companies with whom we expect to compete are much larger than we are  have  in many cases  well developed distribution systems and networks for their products  have valuable historical relationships with the potential customers we are seeking to serve and have much more extensive sales and marketing programs in place to promote their products 
some of our competitors may use their influence to impede the development and acceptance of our products 
our limited resources relative to many of our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures 
in the nascent markets for renewable chemicals and fuels  it is difficult to predict which  if any  market entrants will be successful  and we may lose market share to competitors producing new or existing renewable products 
we expect to face competition for our nutrition and skin and personal care products from other companies in these fields  many of whom have greater resources and experience than we do 
if we cannot compete effectively against these companies or their products  we may not be successful in selling our products or further growing our business 
we expect that our nutrition products will compete with providers in both the specialty and mass food ingredient markets 
many of these companies  such as cargill  incorporated  monsanto company and syngenta ag  are larger than we are  have well developed distribution systems and networks for their products and have valuable historical relationships with the potential customers and distributors we hope to serve 
we may also compete with companies seeking to produce nutrition products based on renewable oils  including dsm food specialties and dupont nutrition health 
we plan to develop nutrition products both within and independent of our joint venture with roquette  but our success will depend on our ability to effectively compete with established companies and successfully commercialize our products 
in the skin and personal care market  we expect to compete with established companies and brands with loyal customer followings 
the market for skin and personal care products is characterized by strong established brands  loyal brand following and heavy brand marketing 
we will compete with companies with well known brands such as kinerase  perricone md  and strivectin 
these companies have greater sales and marketing resources 
we will also compete in the mass consumer market 
some of our competitors in this market have well known brands such as meaningful beauty and principal secret and have substantially greater sales and marketing resources 
we have limited experience in the skin and personal care market 
we will need to continue to devote substantial resources to the marketing of our products and there can be no assurance that we will be successful 

table of contents a decline in the price of petroleum and petroleum based products  plant oils or other commodities may reduce demand for our oils and may otherwise adversely affect our business 
we believe that some of the present and projected demand for renewable fuels results from relatively recent increases in the cost of petroleum and certain plant oils 
we anticipate that most of our oils  and in particular those used to produce fuels  will be marketed as alternatives to corresponding products based on petroleum and plant oils 
if the price of any of these oils falls  we may be unable to produce tailored oils that are cost effective alternatives to their petroleum or plant oil based counterparts 
declining oil prices  or the perception of a future decline in oil prices  may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our potential customers or prevent potential customers from entering into agreements with us to buy our oils 
during sustained periods of lower oil prices we may be unable to sell our oils  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
petroleum prices have been extremely volatile  and this volatility is expected to persist 
lower petroleum prices over extended periods of time may change the perceptions in government and the private sector that cheaper  more readily available energy alternatives should be developed and produced 
if petroleum prices were to decline from present levels and remain at lower levels for extended periods of time  the demand for renewable fuels could be reduced  and our business and revenue may be harmed 
prices of plant oils have also experienced significant volatility 
if prices for oils such as palm kernel were to materially decrease in the future  there may be less demand for oil alternatives  which could reduce demand for our products and harm our business 
the prices of commodities that serve as food ingredients have also been volatile 
to the extent that the prices of these commodities decline and remain at lower levels for extended periods of time  the demand for our nutrition products may be reduced  and our ability to successfully compete in this market may be harmed 
our facilities in california are located near an earthquake fault  and an earthquake or other natural disaster or resource shortage could disrupt our operations 
important documents and records  such as hard copies of our laboratory books and records for our products and some of our manufacturing operations  are located in our corporate headquarters in south san francisco  california  near active earthquake zones 
in the event of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  drought or flood  or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems  we do not have a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan  and could therefore experience a significant business interruption 
in addition  california from time to time has experienced shortages of water  electric power and natural gas 
future shortages and conservation measures could disrupt our operations and could result in additional expense 
although we maintain business interruption insurance coverage  we do not maintain earthquake or flood coverage 
risks related to our intellectual property our competitive position depends on our ability to effectively obtain and enforce patents related to our products  manufacturing components and manufacturing processes 
if we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property  our ability and or our partners ability to commercialize products could suffer 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection sufficient to prevent others from utilizing our manufacturing components  manufacturing processes or marketing our products  as well as to successfully defend and enforce our patents against infringement by others 
in order to protect our products  manufacturing components and manufacturing processes from unauthorized use by third parties  we must hold patent rights that cover our products  manufacturing components and manufacturing processes 
the patent position of biotechnology and bio industrial companies can be highly uncertain because obtaining and determining the scope of patent rights involves complex legal and factual questions 
the standards applied by the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always 
table of contents applied uniformly or predictably 
there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter  the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and bio industrial patents  or the formal requirements to obtain such patents 
consequently  patents may not issue from our pending patent applications 
furthermore  in the process of seeking patent protection or even after a patent is granted  we could become subject to expensive and protracted proceedings  including patent interference  opposition and re examination proceedings  which could invalidate or narrow the scope of our patent rights 
as such  we do not know nor can we predict the scope and or breadth of patent protection that we might obtain on our products and technology 
changes either in patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights 
depending on the decisions and actions taken by the us congress  the federal courts  and the us patent and trademark office  the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future 
the america invents act  which was signed into law on september   brings a number of changes to the us patent system and affects the way patents are prosecuted  challenged and litigated 
among the changes that went into effect september   one of the most significant involves the implementation of a reformed post grant review system 
other changes  which will go into effect on march   include the transition from a first to invent to first to file system  which harmonizes the us with most of the world 
together  these changes may increase the costs of prosecution and enforcement of us patents 
lack of precedential interpretation of the new provisions of the america invents act in specific cases by the us patent and trademark office and the courts increases the uncertainty surrounding the effect of these changes 
while it is currently unclear what impact these changes will have on the operation of our business  they may favor companies able to dedicate more resources to patent filings and challenges 
risks associated with enforcing our intellectual property rights in the united states 
if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent claiming one of our technologies  the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and or unenforceable or assert that the patent does not cover its manufacturing processes  manufacturing components or products 
proving patent infringement may be difficult  especially where it is possible to manufacture a product by multiple processes or a patented process is performed by multiple parties 
furthermore  in patent litigation in the united states  defendant counterclaims alleging both invalidity and unenforceability are commonplace 
although we believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with the duty of candor and in good faith  the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable 
with respect to the validity of our patent rights  we cannot be certain  for example  that there is no invalidating prior art  of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution 
if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and or unenforceability  we would not be able to exclude others from practicing the inventions claimed therein 
such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our business 
defendant counterclaims of antitrust or other anti competitive conduct are also commonplace 
even if our patent rights are found to be valid and enforceable  patent claims that survive litigation may not cover commercially viable products or prevent competitors from importing or marketing products similar to our own  or using manufacturing processes or manufacturing components similar to our own 
although we believe we have obtained assignments of patent rights from all inventors  if an inventor did not adequately assign their patent rights to us  a third party could obtain a license to the patent from such inventor 
this could preclude us from enforcing the patent against such third party 
we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
the laws of some foreign countries where we intend to produce and use our proprietary strains in collaboration with sugar mills or other feedstock suppliers do not protect intellectual property rights to the same 
table of contents extent as the laws of the united states 
many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of certain countries  including brazil and developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or bio industrial technologies 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in these countries 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in certain foreign jurisdictions are unpredictable and could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
accordingly  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
third parties may misappropriate our proprietary strains  information  or trade secrets despite a contractual obligation not to do so 
third parties including joint venture  collaboration  development and feedstock partners  contract manufacturers  and other contractors and shipping agents often have custody or control of our proprietary microbe strains 
if our proprietary microbe strains were stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  they could be used by other parties who may be able to use our strains for their own commercial gain 
it is difficult to prevent misappropriation and subsequent reverse engineering 
in the event that our proprietary microbe strains are misappropriated  it could be difficult for us to challenge the misappropriation and prevent reverse engineering  especially in countries with limited legal and intellectual property protection 
confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information and trade secrets 
in addition to patents  we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our technical know how and other proprietary information 
confidentiality agreements are used  for example  when we talk to potential strategic partners 
in addition  each of our employees signed a confidentiality agreement upon joining our company 
nevertheless  there can be no guarantee that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary confidential information 
this might happen intentionally or inadvertently 
it is possible that a competitor will make use of such information  and that our competitive position will be compromised  in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures 
we also keep as trade secrets certain technical and proprietary information where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our employees  consultants  contractors  outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets to competitors or otherwise use misappropriated trade secrets to compete with us 
it can be expensive and time consuming to enforce a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets 
furthermore  the outcome of such claims is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the us may be less willing to or may not protect trade secrets 
moreover  our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge  methods and know how without misappropriating or otherwise violating our trade secret rights 
where a third party independently develops equivalent knowledge  methods and know how without misappropriating or otherwise violating our trade secret rights  they may be able to seek patent protection for such equivalent knowledge  methods and know how 
this could prohibit us from practicing our trade secrets 
claims by patent holders that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their patent rights could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve  whether or not we are successful  and an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to commercialize our technology depends on our ability to develop  manufacture  market and sell our products without infringing the proprietary rights of patent holders or their authorized agents 
an issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice or utilize the patented inventions or commercialize the patented 
table of contents product 
third parties may have blocking patents that may prevent us from commercializing our patented products and utilizing our patented manufacturing components and manufacturing processes 
in the event that we are made aware of blocking third party patents  we cannot be sure that licenses to the blocking third party patents would be available or obtainable on terms favorable to us or at all 
numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  which are owned by third parties  relate to the production of bio industrial products  including oils  chemicals and biofuels  and the use of microalgae strains  such as microalgae strains containing genes to alter oil composition 
as such  there could be existing valid patents that our manufacturing processes  manufacturing components  or products may inadvertently infringe 
there could also be existing invalid or unenforceable patents that could nevertheless be asserted against us and would require expenditure of resources to defend 
in addition  there are pending patent applications that are currently unpublished and therefore unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that are infringed by our products  manufacturing processes or other aspects of our business 
we may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that one of our products  manufacturing processes or manufacturing components infringes the intellectual property rights of others 
there is inevitable uncertainty in any litigation  including patent litigation 
defending against claims of patent infringement is costly and time consuming  regardless of the outcome 
thus  even if we were to ultimately prevail  or to settle at an early stage  such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources 
they are  therefore  likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could 
in addition  the costs and uncertainty associated with patent litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our internal research and development programs  in license needed technology  or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us commercialize our technologies 
in addition  litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team  distracting them from the pursuit of other company business 
if a party successfully asserts a patent or other intellectual property rights against us  we might be barred from using certain of our manufacturing processes or manufacturing components  or from developing and commercializing related products 
injunctions against using specified processes or components  or prohibitions against commercializing specified products  could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between us and a third party 
in addition  we may be required to pay substantial damage awards to the third party  including treble or enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed the third party s intellectual property rights 
we may also be required to obtain a license from the third party in order to continue manufacturing and or marketing the products that were found to infringe 
it is possible that the necessary license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
this could limit our ability to competitively commercialize some or all of our products 
during the course of any patent litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  rulings on motions  and other interim proceedings in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative  the perceived value of our products  technology or intellectual property could be diminished 
accordingly  the market price of our common stock may decline 
we have received government funding in connection with the development of certain of our proprietary technologies  which could negatively affect our intellectual property rights in such technologies 
some of our proprietary technology was developed with us federal government funding 
when new technologies are developed with us government funding  the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents  including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non commercial purposes 
these rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march in rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology 
the government can exercise its march in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the us government funded technology  because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety 
table of contents needs  to meet requirements of federal regulations  or to give preference to us industry 
in addition  us government funded inventions must be reported to the government and us government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications 
in addition  our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and foreign manufacturing restrictions 
any exercise by the government of such rights could harm our competitive position or impact our operating results 
in addition  some of our technology was funded by a grant from the state of california 
inventions funded by this grant may be subject to forfeiture if we do not seek to patent or practically apply them 
any such forfeiture could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our finances and capital requirements our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 
our revenues and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our results of operations on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
factors that could cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate include achievement  or failure to achieve  technology or product development milestones needed to allow us to enter target markets on a cost effective basis  delays or greater than anticipated expenses associated with the completion of new production facilities  and the time to complete scale up of production following completion of a new manufacturing facility  disruptions in the production process at any facility where we produce our products  the timing  size and mix of sales to customers for our products  increases in price or decreases in availability of feedstocks  fluctuations in the price of and demand for products based on petroleum or other oils for which our oils are alternatives  the unavailability of contract manufacturing capacity altogether or at anticipated cost  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  seasonal production and sale of our products  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  unanticipated expenses associated with changes in governmental regulations and environmental  health and safety requirements  reductions or changes to existing fuel and chemical regulations and policies  departure of key employees  business interruptions  such as earthquakes and other natural disasters  our ability to integrate businesses that we may acquire  risks associated with the international aspects of our business  and changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  both domestically and in foreign markets in which we operate 
due to these factors and others the results of any quarterly or annual period may not meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors and may not be meaningful indications of our future performance 

table of contents we may require additional financing in the future and may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  which could force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our research and development or commercialization activities 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering  completed in june  private placements of our equity securities  government grants and funding from strategic partners 
in january we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due  which bear interest at a rate of per year  payable in cash semi annually commencing in august in may  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank that provided for a million credit facility consisting of i a million term loan and ii a million revolving facility 
while we plan to enter into relationships with partners or collaborators for them to provide some portion or all of the capital needed to build production facilities  we may determine that it is more advantageous for us to provide some portion or all of the financing for new production facilities 
some of our previous funding has come from government grants  however  our future ability to obtain government grants is uncertain due to the competitive bid process and other factors 
we may have to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to meet our capital requirements  including our portion of joint venture funding requirements 
for example  although the solazyme bunge jv recently entered a loan agreement with bndes for project financing funding under which will support the joint venture s production facility in brazil  including a portion of the construction costs of the facility  if we are unable to finalize the loan documentation including the required guarantee on acceptable terms  the solazyme bunge jv will be unable to draw down amounts under the loan and will have to seek additional financing 
if the solazyme bunge jv is unable to secure additional financing  we will be required to fund our portion of the solazyme bunge jv s capital requirements either from existing sources or seek additional financing 
we may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop and commercialize products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research and development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash  and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay amounts due under our indebtedness  including our convertible notes 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  including our convertible notes  depends on our future performance  which is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures 
if we are unable to generate such cash flow  we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive 
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms  which could result in a default on our debt obligations 
despite our current debt levels  we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would intensify the risks discussed above 
despite our current consolidated debt levels  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future  subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments  some of which may be secured debt 
we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes from incurring additional debt  securing existing or future debt  recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other 
table of contents actions that are not limited by the terms governing the notes 
our existing credit facility with silicon valley bank restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  but if the facility matures or is repaid  we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness 
we have received government grant funding and may pursue government funding in the future 
loss of our government grant funding could adversely impact our future plans 
we have been awarded an approximately million integrated bio refinery grant from the us department of energy doe 
the terms of this grant make the funds available to us to develop us based production capabilities for renewable fuels derived from microalgae at the peoria facility 
government grant agreements generally have fixed terms and may be terminated  modified or recovered by the granting agency under certain conditions 
we are in the process of obtaining reimbursement under the grant for funds spent by us in connection with the integrated bio refinery 
if we were unable to obtain reimbursement under the grant  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
activities funded by a government grant are subject to audits by government agencies 
as part of an audit  these agencies may review our performance  cost structures and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
grant funds must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the granting agency  rather than for all of our programs generally 
if any of our costs are found to be allocated improperly  the costs may not be reimbursed and any costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded 
accordingly  an audit could result in an adjustment to our revenues and results of operations 
we are also subject to additional regulations based on our receipt of government grant funding and entry into government contracts 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we may face penalties and may not be awarded government funding or contracts in the future 
if we engage in any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may seek to acquire additional businesses  assets  technologies or products to enhance our business 
in connection with any acquisitions  we could issue additional equity or equity linked securities such as our convertible notes  which would dilute our stockholders  incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions  or assume significant liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs and other liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and or prospective collaborators  customers and or suppliers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  and incur write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
if we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
raising additional funds may cause dilution to our stockholders or require us to relinquish valuable rights 
if we elect to raise additional funds through equity offerings or offerings of equity linked securities  our stockholders would likely experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities 
for example  the loan and security agreement we entered into with silicon valley bank in may contains financial covenants that  if breached  would require us to secure our obligations thereunder 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary for us to share a portion of the margin from the sale of our products 
we may also be required to relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 

table of contents if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud  in that case  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
in addition  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting  and have our chief executive officer and chief financial officer certify as to the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports 
the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section is expensive and time consuming  and requires significant attention from management 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
our management has concluded that there are no material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  however  there can be no assurance that our controls over financial processes and reporting will be effective in the future or that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
risks relating to securities markets and investment in our stock the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the volatility of our common stock may affect the price of our common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies  particularly small technology companies  can be very low 
limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its future volatility 
price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors  including any of the risk factors described in this annual report on form k 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of the common stock by investors who view our convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving the common stock 
if our executive officers  directors and largest stockholders choose to act together  they may be able to control our management and operations  acting in their own best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
as of december  our executive officers  directors and beneficial holders of or more of our outstanding stock beneficially owned approximately of our common stock  including shares subject to repurchase 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders  and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of delaware law where we are incorporated  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders  requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and dividing our board of directors into three classes so that only one third of our directors will be up for election in any given year 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  under certain circumstances  may make it more difficult for a person who would be an interested stockholder  as defined in section  to effect various business combinations with us for a three year period 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not exclude us from the restrictions imposed under section these provisions could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock  which  under certain circumstances  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
being a public company increases our expenses and administrative burden 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
for example  as a public company  we have adopted internal and disclosure controls and procedures and bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under applicable securities laws 
in addition  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global select market  create uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and  as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our 
table of contents board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee  and attract and retain qualified executive officers 
if these requirements divert our management s attention from other business concerns  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if securities or industry analysts do not continue coverage of our company  the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends  and accordingly  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  only appreciation of the price of our common stock  which may never occur  would provide a return to stockholders 
investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock

overview we make oils 
our proprietary technology transforms a range of low cost  plant based sugars into high value oils 
our renewable products can replace or enhance oils derived from the world s three existing sources petroleum  plants and animal fats 
we tailor the composition of our oils to address specific customer requirements  offering superior performance characteristics and value 
our oils can address the major markets served by conventional oils  which represented an opportunity of over trillion in initially  we are commercializing our products into three target markets chemicals and fuels  nutrition and skin and personal care 
we create oils that mirror or enhance the chemical composition of conventional oils used today 
until now  the physical and chemical characteristics of conventional oils have been dictated by oils found in nature or blends derived from them 
we have created a new paradigm that enables us to design and produce novel tailored oils that cannot be achieved through blending of existing oils alone 
these tailored oils offer enhanced value as compared to conventional oils 
for example  our tailored  renewable oils can enable our customers to enhance product performance  reduce processing costs and or enhance their products sustainability profile 
our oils are drop in replacements such that they are compatible with existing production  refining  finishing and distribution infrastructure in all of our target markets 
we have pioneered an industrial biotechnology platform that harnesses the prolific oil producing capability of microalgae 
our technology allows us to optimize oil profiles with different carbon chain lengths  saturation levels and functional groups to modify important characteristics 
we use standard industrial fermentation equipment to efficiently scale and accelerate microalgae s natural oil production time to a few days 
by feeding our proprietary oil producing microalgae plant sugars in dark fermentation tanks  we are in effect utilizing indirect photosynthesis  in contrast to traditional open pond approaches 
our platform is feedstock flexible and can utilize a wide variety of renewable plant based sugars  such as sugarcane based sucrose  corn based dextrose  and sugar from other sustainable biomass sources including cellulosics  which we believe will represent an important alternative feedstock in the longer term 
furthermore  our platform allows us to produce and sell specialty bioproducts from the protein  fiber and other compounds produced by microalgae 
we expect our products to generate attractive margins in our target markets 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will capture the enhanced value of our tailored oils 
based on the technology milestones we have demonstrated  we believe the conversion cost profile we have achieved to date will  when implemented at scale  enable us to profitably engage in our target markets 
for example  our lead microalgae strains producing oil for the chemicals and fuels markets have achieved key performance metrics that we believe would allow us to generate attractive margins on the manufacture of oils today assuming the use of a larger scale  built for purpose commercial plant inclusive of the anticipated cost of financing and facility depreciation 

table of contents we have scaled up our technology platform and have successfully operated at lab liter  pilot  liter  demonstration  liter and commercial approximately  liter fermenter scale 
our achievement of the following milestones demonstrates the ongoing development of our platform the establishment of our pilot plant in south san francisco  with recovery operations capable of handling material from both and  liter fermenters  has enabled us to produce samples of our tailored oils for testing and optimization by our partners  as well as to test new process conditions at an intermediate scale 
since  the operation of our fermentation process in commercial sized standard industrial fermentation equipment  liter accessed through manufacturing partners 
since  the operation of downstream processing equipment at facilities in iowa and kentucky where we use commercially sized  standard plant oil recovery equipment to recover the oil at low cost and high volume 
in  the successful commissioning of our first fully integrated bio refinery ibr in peoria  illinois peoria facility  to produce algal oils 
the ibr was partially funded with a federal grant that we received from the us department of energy doe to demonstrate integrated commercial scale production of renewable algal based fuels 
the plant has a nameplate capacity of two million liters of oil annually and will provide an important platform for continued work on feedstock flexibility and scaling of new tailored oils into the marketplace 
in  we began commercial fermentation of our alguronic acid production at the peoria facility and we transferred a significant amount of our fermentation production of alguronic acid from contract manufacturers to the peoria facility 
in april  our entrance into a joint venture agreement with bunge global innovation  llc and certain of its affiliates collectively  bunge  one of the largest sugarcane processing companies in brazil  establishing a joint venture solazyme bunge jv to construct and operate an oil production facility adjacent to bunge s sugarcane mill in moema  brazil  with an annual expected name plate capacity of  metric tons

algenist distribution partners 
in december  we entered into an exclusive distribution contract with sephora emea to distribute our algenist product line in sephora emea stores in certain countries in europe and select countries in the middle east and asia 
in january  we also made arrangements with sephora americas to sell our algenist product line in sephora americas stores which currently includes locations in the united states and canada 
in october  we launched our algenist product line at sephora inside jcpenney stores in the united states 
in march  we entered into an agreement with qvc  inc qvc and launched the sale of our algenist product line through qvc s multimedia platform 
unilever 
in october  we entered into a joint development agreement with unilever our fourth agreement together which expands our current research and development efforts 
upon successful completion of the development agreement and related activities  we have agreed with unilever to the terms of a multi year supply agreement in which unilever would purchase commercial quantities of our renewable oils 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have focused on building our corporate infrastructure  developing our core technology and designing a manufacturing process to scale up our biotechnology platform to position us in our target markets 
prior to our agreement with roquette  which generated license fees  our revenues were primarily from collaborative research and government grants 
we expect to sell our products in the future into three target markets chemicals and fuels  nutrition  and skin and personal care 
the products that we sell and intend to sell into our target markets have significantly different selling prices  volumes and expected contribution margins 
we expect our product revenues in the near term to be comprised almost entirely from the sale of products into the skin and personal care market 
we expect that this market will provide us with the highest gross margin of our three target markets 
in the longer term  we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will come from the chemicals and fuels markets  which have lower  but still attractive  margins and higher volumes 
to date our revenues have consisted of research and development program revenues and license fees  and beginning in the first quarter of  included product revenues 
research and development program revenues revenues from research and development r d programs are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government grants and agreements were provided have been met and only perfunctory obligations are outstanding 
we currently have active r d programs with governmental agencies and commercial partners 
these r d programs are entered into pursuant to grants and agreements that generally provide payment for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
revenues related to r d programs include reimbursable expenses and payments received for full time equivalent employee services recognized over the related performance periods for each of the contracts 
we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement based on 
table of contents the terms and performance periods set forth in the agreements as outlined above

revenues from government grants and agreements represented   and of total r d revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues from commercial and strategic partner development agreements represented   and of total r d revenues in  and  respectively 
product revenues product revenues consist of revenues from products sold commercially into each of our target markets 
starting in  we recognized revenues from the sale of our first commercial product line  algenist  which we distributed to the skin and personal care end market through arrangements with sephora sa and its affiliates sephora  qvc  space nk 
we may also launch the algenist product line in additional geographies and or through additional distribution channels 
product revenues represented and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
license fees recognition of license fees is dependent on the specific terms of the license agreement 
to date  license fee revenue consists of up front  one time  non refundable fees for licensing our technology for commercialization in solazyme roquette nutritionals and these fees have been recognized when cash is received 
license fees represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
costs and operating expenses costs and operating expenses consist of cost of product revenue  research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses 
personnel related expenses including non cash stock based compensation  third party contract manufacturing  reimbursable equipment and costs associated with government contracts  consultants and facility costs comprise the significant components of these expenses 
we expect to continue to hire additional employees  primarily in research and development  manufacturing and commercialization  as we scale our manufacturing capacity and commercialize our technology in target markets 
cost of product revenue in the first quarter of  we launched our first commercial product line  algenist 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of third party contractor costs associated with packaging  distribution and production of algenist products  internal labor  shipping  supplies and other overhead costs associated with production of alguronic acid  a microalgae based active ingredient used in our algenist product line 
we expect our third party contractor costs related to the distribution and production of algenist  as well as our other costs of product revenue  to increase as the demand for our algenist product line grows 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for internal projects as well as partner funded collaborative research and development activities with commercial and strategic partners and governmental entities partners 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash stock based compensation  third party contract manufacturing  reimbursable equipment and costs associated with government contracts  consultants  facility costs and overhead  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in development  and laboratory supplies 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
our research and development programs are undertaken to advance our overall industrial biotechnology platform that enables 
table of contents us to produce tailored  high value oils 
although our partners fund certain development activities  they benefit from advances in our technology platform as a whole  including costs funded by other development programs 
therefore  costs for such activities have not been separated as these costs have all been determined to be part of our total research and development related activity 
our research and development efforts are devoted to both internal and external product and process development projects 
our external research and development projects include research and development activities as specified in our government grants and contracts and development agreements with commercial and strategic partners 
internal research activities and projects focus on strain screening  improvement and optimization in order to provide a detailed inventory of individual strain outputs under precisely controlled conditions  process development aimed at reducing the cost of oil production  and scale up of commercial scale production 
our peoria facility  which we acquired in may  commenced fermentation operations in the fourth quarter of  and we successfully commissioned our first integrated biorefinery in june under our doe program 
we intend to use our peoria facility for joint development activities as well as commercial production for certain high value products 
in november we also entered into an agreement with adm to utilize adm s existing commercial scale production facility 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the near term as we scale up to commercial production 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash stock based compensation related to our executive management  corporate administration  sales and marketing functions  professional and legal services  administrative and facility overhead expenses 
these expenses also include costs related to our business development and sales functions  including marketing programs 
professional services consist primarily of consulting  external legal  accounting and temporary help 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to increase as we incur additional costs related to commercializing our business  including our growth and expansion in brazil  and operating as a publicly traded company  including increased legal fees  accounting fees  costs of compliance with securities  corporate governance and other regulations  investor relations expenses and higher insurance premiums 
in addition  we expect to incur additional costs as we hire personnel and enhance our infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business 
other income expense  net interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities and cash balances 
our interest income will vary for each reporting period depending on our average investment balances during the period and market interest rates 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest related to our debt 
as of december  and  our outstanding debt was approximately million and million  respectively 
we expect interest expense to fluctuate with changes in our debt obligations 
gain loss from change in fair value of warrant liability loss from change in fair value of warrant liability consists primarily of the change in the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants and a common stock warrant issued to bunge limited 
the warrant liability is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and or upon vesting  and the change in the then current aggregate fair value of the warrants is recorded as a gain or loss from the change in the fair value in 
table of contents our consolidated statement of operations 
the warrant liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital upon conversion of redeemable preferred stock  or vesting of common warrant shares 
the redeemable convertible stock warrants were converted into common stock or common stock warrants upon the close of our initial public offering in june  and the related preferred stock warrant liability of million was reclassified to additional paid in capital and was no longer adjusted to fair value 
in april  the first and second tranches of the common stock warrant issued to bunge limited had vested  and the related warrant liability of million was reclassified to additional paid in capital and was no longer adjusted to fair value 
the third tranche of the common stock warrant issued to bunge limited was unvested as of december   and will be remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the warrant shares have vested 
income loss from equity method investments  net revenues generated from the sale of products by solazyme roquette nutritionals will be recognized by the solazyme roquette jv  while income loss from the equity method investment in the solazyme roquette jv will be recorded in our income statement as income loss from equity method investments  net 
we do not expect to record any solazyme roquette jv income loss in the near future 
income loss from the equity method investment in solazyme bunge jv is recorded in our income statement as income loss from equity method investments  net 
income taxes since inception  we have incurred net losses and have not recorded any us federal  state or non us income tax provisions 
accordingly  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas of management s judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently recognize revenues from r d programs that consist of government programs and collaborative research and development agreements with commercial and strategic partners and from commercial sales of our skin care products 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
if collaborative research and development or sales agreements contain multiple elements  we evaluate whether the components of each arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
we have determined that all of our revenue arrangements should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
application of revenue 
table of contents recognition standards requires subjective determination and requires management to make judgments about the fair values of each individual element and whether it is separable from other aspects of the contractual relationship 
for each source of revenue  we apply the above revenue recognition criteria in the following manner government program revenues revenues from government programs are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government program activities were provided have been met and only perfunctory obligations are outstanding 
collaborative research and development revenues revenues from collaborative research and development are recognized as the services are performed consistent with the performance requirements of the agreement 
in cases where the planned levels of research and development fluctuate over the research term  we recognize revenues using the proportionate performance method based upon actual efforts to date relative to the amount of expected effort to be incurred by us 
when up front payments are received and the planned levels of research and development do not fluctuate over the research term  revenues are recorded on a ratable basis over the arrangement term  up to the amount of cash received 
when up front payments are received and the planned levels of research and development fluctuate over the research term  revenues are recorded using the proportionate performance method  up to the amount of cash received 
where arrangements include milestones that are determined to be substantive and at risk at the inception of the arrangement  revenues are recognized upon achievement of the milestone and are limited to those amounts for which collectability is reasonably assured 
if these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
license fees recognition of license fees is dependent on the specific terms of the license agreement 
to date  up front one time non refundable fees for licensing our technology for commercialization in a joint venture have been recognized when cash is received 
product revenue product revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  risk of loss and title transfers to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
algenist products are sold with a right of return for expired  discontinued  damaged or non compliant products 
in addition  one customer has a right of return for excess inventory beyond days of consumer demand 
algenist products have an approximate three year shelf life from their manufacture date 
we give credit for returns by issuing a credit memo at the time of product return or  in certain cases  by allowing a customer to decrease the amount of subsequent payments to us for the amount of the return 
we reserve for estimated returns of products at the time revenues are recognized 
to estimate our return reserve  we analyze our own actual product return data  data from our customers regarding their inventory levels and historical return rates of our products  and other known factors  such as our customers return policies to their end consumers  which is typically to days 
we monitor our actual performance by comparing our actual return rates against estimated rates  and adjust our estimated return rates as necessary 
in addition  we estimate a reserve for products that do not meet internal quality standards 
actual returns of algenist products may differ from estimates that we used to calculate such reserves 

table of contents we continually evaluate collectability of our accounts receivable related to product sales  and to date our customers have remitted full payments in a timely manner 
accordingly  we expect full collection of our accounts receivable balance related to product sales and therefore have not established any reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
convertible preferred stock warrants prior to our initial public offering  the freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value because the warrants could conditionally obligate us to redeem the underlying convertible preferred stock at some point in the future 
the warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income expense  in the consolidated statement of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates utilizing an option based model to allocate an estimated business enterprise value to the various classes of our equity stock and related warrants 
prior to our initial public offering  the assumptions used to estimate the business enterprise value and allocation of value to the classes of equity stock and related warrants were highly judgmental 
we used our initial public offering price for the final measurement of these freestanding warrants 
in and  we recorded a gain of million and charges of million  respectively  in other income expense  to reflect the change in the fair value of the warrants 
upon the close of our initial public offering in june  the then aggregate fair value of the related preferred stock warrant liability of million was reclassified to additional paid in capital and we no longer record any related period fair value adjustments 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock based compensation  including the awarding of employee and non employee stock options  based on the grant date estimated fair value 
we amortize the fair value of the employee stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
options and restricted stock units granted to non employees are re measured as the services are performed and the options and restricted stock units vest  and the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
we account for restricted stock units issued to employees based on the fair market value of our common stock 
we estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the following inputs expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield rate  exercise price and closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
due to our limited history of grant activity  we calculate our expected term utilizing the simplified method permitted by the sec  which is the average of the total contractual term of the option and its vesting period 
we calculate our expected volatility rate from the historical volatilities of selected comparable public companies within our industry  due to a lack of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price 
we will continue to analyze the historical stock price volatility assumption as more historical data for our common stock becomes available 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities similar to the option s expected term 
the expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero  as we have not paid  nor do we anticipate paying  cash dividends on shares of our common stock 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
our stock based compensation expense is expected to increase in the future as we recognize expense related to unvested stock based awards and we issue additional stock based awards to attract and retain employees and nonemployee consultants 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and a foreign jurisdiction  and we use estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december  and  we had a full valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc  income taxes  to account for uncertain tax positions 
as of december  and  we had no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  and revenues year ended december  change in thousands revenues research and development programs net product revenue license fee total revenues our total revenues increased by million in compared to  due primarily to a million increase in algenist product revenue which launched in march and million increase in r d program revenue  offset in part by a million decrease in license fees related to an up front non refundable fee for licensing our technology to solazyme roquette nutritionals 
the decrease in license fee revenue was expected per the terms of the solazyme roquette nutritionals joint venture agreement

r d program revenues increased by million  due to a million increase in revenues from government program revenues  offset by a million decrease in revenues from our development agreements with strategic partners 

table of contents our government program revenues increased in compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased activities associated with our doe and cec grants in  partially offset by the successful completion of the second phase of our dod fuels testing and certification contract in june the grant awarded by the doe is funding up to million of the build out  equipment costs and certain research and development costs associated with our integrated biorefinery program at our peoria facility 
we successfully commissioned the integrated biorefinery in our peoria facility in the second quarter of and anticipate that the remaining objectives under the program will be completed as outlined in the program by the end of remaining costs to complete the objectives of the doe award are expected to be fully funded by us 
in october  the cec agreed to fund up to million for continuing research and development at our south san francisco pilot plant facility through early our revenues from development agreements with strategic partners decreased in due to timing of agreements that ended offset by new agreements entered into since the second half of in general  we expect that our r d program revenues will continue to be a meaningful part of revenues as work with our strategic partners in our existing and new r d agreements enable important market development activities 
as we enter into new agreements with strategic partners and or government programs  we expect that quarterly trends may fluctuate based on the timing of program activities 
in the near term  we expect lower government program revenues offset by increased product revenues primarily from sales of our algenist brand 
we expect our product revenue to further increase as we ramp initial commercial manufacturing of tailored oils toward nameplate capacity at each facility and sell our tailored oils to industry partners and customers 
cost of product revenues year ended december  change in thousands cost of revenue product gross profit product cost of product revenue increased in compared to primarily due to increased sales of algenist products  which launched in march gross margin percentage on product sales increased slightly from in to in we expect algenist gross profit percentages will continue to exceed

in the second quarter of  we granted bunge limited a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant vests in three separate tranches  each contingent upon the achievement of specific performance based milestones related to the formation and operations of solazyme bunge jv 
the unvested warrant shares are classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet beginning in the second quarter of  and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and reclassified to additional paid in capital upon vesting

the decrease in license fee revenue was expected per the terms of the solazyme roquette nutritionals joint venture agreement 
r d program revenues increased by million primarily due to a million increase in revenues from our development agreements with our strategic partners  partially offset by a decrease of million in government program revenues 
our collaborative research revenues were primarily related to funding from agreements including chevron  bunge and unilever to develop microalgae based oils 
our government program revenues decreased in compared to  primarily due to the timing of our naval marine diesel and jet fuel program activities associated with our dod contracts  partially offset by increase in revenues associated with our doe grant awarded in the second quarter of we completed our first two dod contracts for the production

the following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities 
table of contents sources and uses of capital since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses as we continue our scale up activities  support commercialization activities for our products and expand our research and development activities 
in addition  we may acquire additional manufacturing facilities  expand or build out our current manufacturing facilities and or build additional manufacturing facilities 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we expect to continue making significant investments in research and development and manufacturing  and expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of operating as a publicly traded company 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales  collaborative research and joint development activities  licensing fees and other revenue arrangements to achieve profitability 
in january  we obtained a grant from the doe to receive up to million for reimbursement of expenses incurred towards building  operating  and optimizing a pilot scale integrated biorefinery  which has allowed us to develop integrated us based production capabilities for renewable fuels derived from microalgae at the peoria facility 
under the terms of the grant  we are responsible for funding an additional million 
we purchased the peoria facility in may we began fermentation operations in the fourth quarter of and successfully commissioned our integrated biorefinery in june  funded in part by the doe grant described above 
in connection with the closing of the peoria facility acquisition  we entered into a promissory note  mortgage and security agreement with the seller in the initial amount of million 
the promissory note is interest free with two lump sum payments  the first of which was paid in march  and the second payment was made in february the note is secured by the real and personal property acquired from the seller 
the purchase agreement does not contain financial ratio covenants  nor any affirmative or negative financial covenants  other than a prohibition on creating any liens against the collateral as defined in the agreement 
in april  we entered into the solazyme bunge jv  which is jointly capitalized by us and bunge  to construct and operate an oil production facility in brazil that will utilize our proprietary technology to produce tailored oils from sugar feedstock provided by bunge 
through february  we contributed million in capital to the solazyme bunge jv  and we may need to contribute additional capital to this project 
in february  the solazyme bunge jv entered a loan agreement with the brazilian development bank bndes under which it may borrow up to r million approximately usd million based on the current exchange rate 
as a condition of the solazyme bunge jv drawing funds under the loan  we will be required to guarantee a portion of the loan in an amount not to exceed our ownership percentage in the solazyme bunge jv 
the bndes funding will support the solazyme bunge jv s first commercial scale production facility in brazil  which will reduce the capital requirements funded directly by us and bunge 
we expect to scale up additional manufacturing capacity in a capital efficient manner by signing additional agreements whereby our partners will invest capital and operational resources in building manufacturing capacity  while also providing access to feedstock 
we are currently negotiating with additional potential feedstock partners in latin america and the united states to co locate oil production at their mills 
depending on the specifics of each partner discussion  we may choose to deploy some portion of the equity capital required to construct additional production facilities  as such capital contribution may influence the scope and timing of our relationship 
we expect to evaluate the optimal amount of capital expenditures that we agree to fund on a case by case basis 
these events may require us to access additional capital through equity or debt offerings 
if we are unable to access additional capital  our growth may be limited due to the inability to build out additional manufacturing capacity 
in november  we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with adm  whereby we have agreed to pay adm annual fees for use and operation of its commercial scale facility in clinton  iowa  a portion of which may be paid in our common stock 
in january  we made the first payment to adm in common stock and cash 

table of contents on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank the bank that provided for a million credit facility the facility consisting of i a million term loan the term loan that was accessible in one or more increments prior to november  and ii a million revolving facility the revolving facility 
a portion of the revolving facility is available for letters of credit and foreign exchange contracts with the bank 
the facility will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the facility is unsecured unless we breach financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum of million in unrestricted cash and investments  of which at least million are to be maintained in accounts with the bank and its affiliates 
this minimum balance requirement is considered a compensating balance arrangement  and is classified in the consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents and or marketable securities as this minimum balance is not restricted as to withdrawal 
interest is charged under the facility at i a fixed rate of per annum with respect to the term loan and ii a floating rate per annum equal to the most recently quoted prime rate in the wall street journal western edition with respect to revolving loans 
upon an event of default or financial covenant default  outstanding obligations under the facility shall bear interest at a rate up to three percentage points above the rates described in i and ii above 
the term loan is payable in equal monthly payments of principal and interest  with the first payment due on december  the maturity date is i november  for the term loan and ii may  for the revolving loans 
we have the option to prepay all  but not less than all  of the amounts advanced under the term loan  provided that we provide written notice to the bank at least ten days prior to such prepayment  and pay all outstanding principal and accrued interest  plus all other sums  if any  that shall have become due and payable  on the date of such prepayment 
in addition to the financial covenant referenced above  we are subject to financial covenants and customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default under the facility including certain restrictions on borrowing 
if an event of default occurs and continues  the bank may declare all outstanding obligations under the facility immediately due and payable 
the outstanding obligations would become immediately due if we become insolvent 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants under this facility as of december  and on may   we borrowed million under the term loan portion of the facility and in december we began to repay principal payments on this loan 
in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes notes due in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears on august and february of each year  beginning on august  the notes are convertible into our common stock and will mature on february   unless earlier repurchased or converted 
the company may not redeem the notes prior to maturity 
the initial conversion price will be approximately per share of common stock and  under certain circumstances  the note holders will be entitled to additional payments upon conversion 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to february  into shares of our common stock at the then applicable conversion rate 
the conversion rate is initially shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
in the event the notes are converted prior to february   the holders are entitled to receive an early conversion payment of per  principal amount of notes surrendered for conversion that may be settled  at the company s election  in cash or  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  in shares of our common stock 
if we undergo a fundamental change as defined in the indenture entered into with the trustee  note holders may require that we repurchase for cash all or part of their notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the fundamental change repurchase date 
in addition  if fundamental changes occur  we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for any notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  revenue from product sales and net proceeds from the notes issued in january will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next months 
however  our liquidity assumptions may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may elect to raise additional funds within this period of time through public or private debt or equity financings and or additional collaborations 

table of contents our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including those set forth under risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our funding requirements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds  we will have to reduce our operating costs and delay our manufacturing and research and development programs

recent accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our outstanding debt obligations 
we generally invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms 
accordingly  our interest income fluctuates with short term market conditions 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of corporate debt obligations  us government agency securities  asset backed and mortgaged backed securities  municipal bonds and money market funds  which are held for working capital purposes 
we believe we do not have material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
our marketable securities were comprised primarily of fixed term securities as of december  due to the short term nature of these instruments  we do not believe that there would be a significant negative impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of interest rate fluctuations in the financial markets 
our outstanding debt as of december  consists of fixed rate debt  and therefore is not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates 
foreign currency risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities primarily in the united states  as well as research activities primarily in the united states 
we are actively expanding outside the united states  in particular in europe and brazil through our solazyme roquette jv and solazyme bunge jv  respectively 
we also launched the algenist product line in europe in march and conduct operations in brazil 
as we expand internationally  our results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  our operations in brazil and or potential expansion elsewhere in latin america or increasing euro denominated product sales to european distributors  will result in our use of currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  the local currency is the functional currency of our brazil subsidiary  and therefore the assets and liabilities are translated from its functional currency to us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  with resulting foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
as a result  our comprehensive income loss  cash flows and expenses are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into us dollars 
we have not hedged our foreign currency since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
although substantially all of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
we may consider hedging our foreign currency risk as we continue to expand internationally 
commodity price risk our exposure to market risk for changes in commodity prices currently relates primarily to our purchases of plant sugar feedstock 
we have not historically hedged the price volatility of plant sugar feedstock 
in the future  we may manage our exposure to this risk by hedging the price volatility of feedstock  principally through futures contracts  and entering into joint venture agreements that would enable us to obtain secure access to feedstock
