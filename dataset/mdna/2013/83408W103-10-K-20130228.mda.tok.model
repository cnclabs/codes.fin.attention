critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
identified below are the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments  and those that we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements 
basis of consolidation and recognition of noncontrolling interest the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of sohu and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and the consolidated variable interest entities vies 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated 
we have adopted the guidance of accounting for vies  which requires vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for the consolidated vies  our management made evaluations of the relationships between us and our vies and the economic benefit flow of contractual arrangements with the vies 
in connection with such evaluation  management also took into account the fact that  as a result of such contractual arrangements  the sohu group controls the shareholders voting interests in these vies 
as a result of such evaluation  management concluded that the sohu group is the primary beneficiary of its consolidated vies 
we have one vie that is not consolidated by us since we are not the primary beneficiary 
noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity of majority owned subsidiaries and vies which is not attributable  directly or indirectly  to the controlling shareholder 
currently  the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of noncontrolling interests for changyou and sogou 
noncontrolling interest for changyou to reflect the economic interest in changyou held by shareholders other than sohu noncontrolling shareholders  changyou s net income attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated statements of comprehensive income  based on their share of the economic interests in changyou 
changyou s cumulative results of operations attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders  along with changes in shareholders equity  adjustment for share based compensation expense in relation to those share based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and adjustment for changes in sohu s ownership in changyou from sohu s purchase of changyou adss representing class a ordinary shares  are recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents noncontrolling interest for sogou to reflect the economic interest in sogou held by shareholders other than sohu noncontrolling shareholders  sogou s net income loss attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders is recorded as noncontrolling interest in sohu s consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
sogou s cumulative results of operations attributable to these noncontrolling shareholders  along with changes in shareholders equity deficit and adjustment for share based compensation expense in relation to those share based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and noncontrolling shareholders investments in series a preferred shares are accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in sohu s consolidated balance sheets  as redemption of the noncontrolling interest is solely within the control of sohu 
these treatments are based on the terms governing investment by the noncontrolling shareholders in the series a preferred shares of sogou the sogou series a terms  the terms of sogou s restructuring  and sohu s purchase of sogou series a preferred shares from alibaba 
by virtue of these terms  as sogou has been losing money since its restructuring  the net losses have been and will be allocated in the following order i net losses were allocated to ordinary shareholders until their basis in sogou decreased to zero  ii additional net losses will be allocated to holders of sogou series a preferred shares until their basis in sogou decreases to zero  and iii further net losses will be allocated between ordinary shareholders and holders of sogou series a preferred shares based on their shareholding percentage in sogou 
any subsequent net income from sogou will be allocated in the following order i net income will be allocated between ordinary shareholders and holders of sogou series a preferred shares based on their shareholding percentage in sogou until their basis in sogou increases to zero  ii additional net income will be allocated to holders of sogou series a preferred shares to bring their basis back  iii further net income will be allocated to ordinary shareholders to bring their basis back  and iv further net income will be allocated between ordinary shareholders and holders of sogou series a preferred shares based on their shareholding percentage in sogou 
segment reporting our segments are business units that offer different services and are reviewed separately by the chief operating decision maker codm  or the decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
our codm is the chief executive officer 
there are five segments in the sohu group  consisting of brand advertising  sogou which mainly consists of the search and others business  changyou which mainly consists of the online game business  wireless and others 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the recognition of revenues involves certain management judgments 
the amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under asc  barter trade transactions from which physical goods or services other than advertising services are received in exchange for advertising services should be recorded based on the fair values of the goods and or services received 
for a barter transaction involving online advertising services  we recognize revenue and expense at fair value only if the fair value of the advertising services surrendered received in the transaction is determinable 
for our advertising for advertising barter transactions  the fair value of the advertising surrendered received is not determinable  so no revenue from advertising for advertising barter transactions is recognized 
online advertising revenues online advertising revenues include revenues from brand advertising services as well as search and others services 
we recognize gross revenue for the amount of fees we receive from our advertisers 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors 
the primary factor is whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating the terms of the arrangement 
our revenues from online advertising services are recognized on a gross basis as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability 
these revenues are recognized after deducting agent rebates paid to advertising agencies and applicable taxes and or related surcharges 

table of contents before september   our online advertising revenues were subject to prc business tax  business tax 
our online advertising revenues were recognized after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax and related surcharges 
business tax is imposed primarily on revenues from the provision of taxable services and is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate by gross revenue 
effective september   the prc ministry of finance and the state administration of taxation launched a business tax to value added tax vat transformation pilot program  the pilot program  for certain industries in eight regions  including beijing and tianjin 
vat payable on goods sold or taxable labor services provided by a general vat taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output vat for the period after crediting the input vat for the period 
hence  the amount of vat payable does not result directly from output vat generated from goods sold or taxable labor services provided 
with the adoption of the pilot program  our online advertising revenues are subject to vat 
our online advertising revenues are now recognized after deducting agent rebates and net of vat and related surcharges 
brand advertising revenues business model currently the brand advertising business has two main types of pricing models  consisting of the fixed price model and the cost per impression cpm pricing model 
under the fixed price model  a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for the advertising services to be provided 
under the cpm pricing model  the total contract amount for the advertising services is not fixed 
instead  a fixed price for each qualifying display is stated 
advertisers using the cpm pricing model pay us based on the number of qualifying displays of their advertisements appearing on our websites  and we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time their advertisements are displayed on the websites  on the condition that each display meets certain selected criteria imposed by advertisers 
we provide advertisement placements to our advertisers on our different website channels and in different formats  which can include  among other things  banners  links  logos  buttons  full screen  pre roll  post roll  and mid roll video screens  as well as pause video screens 
revenue recognition for brand advertising revenue recognition  prior to entering into contracts  we make a credit assessment of the customer to assess the collectability of the contract 
for those contracts for which the collectability is determined to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
for those contracts for which the collectability is determined not to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue only when the cash was received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
before  since almost all of the elements were delivered within one calendar quarter  we treated all elements of advertising contracts as one single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
commencing january   in accordance with asu no 
 we treat advertising contracts with multiple deliverable elements as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and to recognize revenue on a periodic basis during the contract when each deliverable service is provided 
since the contract price is for all deliverables  we allocate the arrangement consideration to all deliverables at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling prices 
since the number of advertising contracts that covered more than one quarter and the revenues from advertising contracts that covered more than one quarter were immaterial compared to the total advertising contracts  the impact of adoption of asu to us is immaterial 
search and others revenues search and others services mainly include pay for click services  as well as online marketing services on the sogou web directory 
pay for click services pay for click services are services that enable our advertisers promotional links to be displayed on sogou search result pages and sogou website alliance members websites where the links are relevant to the subject and content of such web pages 
for pay for click services  we introduce internet users to our advertisers through our auction based pay for click systems and charge advertisers on a per click basis when the users click on the displayed links 
revenue for pay for click services is recognized on a per click basis when the users click on the displayed links 
online marketing services on the sogou web directory online marketing services on the sogou web directory mainly consist of displaying advertiser website links on the web pages of the sogou web directory 
the sogou web directory is a chinese web directory navigation site which serves as a key access point to popular and preferred websites and applications 
revenue for online marketing services on the sogou web directory is normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided our obligations under the contract have been met and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

table of contents sogou website alliance both pay for click services and online marketing services on the sogou web directory expand distribution of its advertisers website links or advertisements by leveraging traffic on sogou website alliance members websites 
we recognize gross revenue for the amount of fees it receives from its advertisers 
payments made to sogou website alliance members are included in cost of search and others revenues as traffic acquisition costs 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors 
the primary factor is whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or we are acting as an agent in the transaction 
for pay for click services  we recognize gross revenue  as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability 
whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and is determined by evaluating the terms of the arrangement 
we pay sogou website alliance members based on either revenue sharing arrangements  under which it pays a percentage of pay for click revenues generated from clicks by users of their properties  or on a pre agreed unit price 
online game revenues our online game revenues are generated from mmog operations revenues  web game revenues and overseas licensing revenues 
mmog operations revenues revenues are recorded net of applicable business tax  discounts and rebates to distributors 
online game revenues from changyou s current mmog operations are earned by providing online services to players pursuant to the item based revenue model 
under the item based revenue model  the basic game play functions are free of charge and players are charged for purchases of in game virtual items 
online game revenues are recognized over the estimated lives of the virtual items purchased or as the virtual items are consumed 
if different assumptions were used in deriving the estimated lives of the virtual items  the timing of our recording of the revenues would be impacted 
game operations revenues are collected by changyou s vies through the sale of changyou s prepaid cards  which it sells in both virtual and physical forms to third party distributors and players 
proceeds received from sales of prepaid cards are initially recorded as receipts in advance from customers and  upon activation or charge of the prepaid cards  are transferred from receipts in advance from customers to deferred revenues 
as changyou does not have control of  and generally does not know  the ultimate selling price of the prepaid cards sold by distributors  net proceeds from distributors form the basis of revenue recognition 
prepaid cards will expire two years after the date of card production if they have never been activated 
the proceeds from the expired game cards are recognized as revenue upon expiration of cards 
once the prepaid cards are activated and credited to a player s personal game account  they will not expire as long as the personal game account remains active 
changyou is entitled to suspend and close a player s personal game account if it has been inactive for a period of consecutive days 
the unused balances in an inactive player s personal game account are recognized as revenues when the account is suspended and closed 
web game revenue changyou began generating web game revenue after its acquisition of a controlling interest in road in may through december   road s revenues were derived entirely from revenue sharing payments from third party joint operators of its games and license fees from certain of these joint operators 
beginning in the year ended december   road also derives revenues from direct operation of wartune on its own website for the game  which was launched in may the games developed by road are operated primarily under the item based revenue model  in which game players can access the games free of charge  but may purchase consumable virtual items  including those with a predetermined expiration time  or perpetual virtual items  such as certain costumes that stay bound to a game player throughout the life of the game 
in certain of its joint operation arrangements  road provides its games and related services to a third party joint operator at no upfront fee 
in these arrangements  road is entitled to a single stream of revenue sharing payments from the joint operator when game players convert the joint operator s virtual currency into road s game coins or purchase its game coins directly through such operator s websites or game platform 
certain of the joint operators pay road license fees for the exclusive right to operate its games in specified geographic areas or upon achievement of certain performance milestones from the joint operators operation of the games 
certain of the joint operators also pay road license fees for the right to be among a selected few who will have the initial right ahead of other operators to jointly operate road s games in china during a specified period after their launch 
when road s games are jointly operated through the websites or platforms of third party joint operators  the games may be hosted either on the third party operators servers or on servers that road owns or leases from internet data centers 
in its arrangements with third party joint operators  road views the third party joint operators as its customers and does not view road as the primary obligor  as it does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services 
for road s direct operation of its web game wartune through its website for the game  road is obligated to provide on going services to the game players  and such obligation is not deemed to be inconsequential and perfunctory after game players purchase its game coins directly through its website for wartune 
therefore  road s revenues from direct operation of wartune on its website for the game are first recorded by road as deferred revenues and subsequently recognized as revenue over the service period during which road is obligated to provide services to the game players to enable them to consume their virtual items 

table of contents prc tax authorities have determined that all of road s game revenues from the joint operation of its games within china  which are generated through shenzhen road  are subject to prc vat  and that shenzhen road  as a software enterprise  is entitled to a vat refund immediately upon the filing of its vat returns  with the result that road s net effective prc vat rate is 
road presents prc vat on a gross basis  by which vat at the rate of is included in revenues  and road s net effective prc vat rate of is included in cost of revenues  because shenzhen road s vat obligation and its entitlement to a vat refund are one integrated preferential vat policy 
overseas licensing revenue changyou enters into licensing arrangements with overseas licensees to operate its mmogs in other countries or regions 
these license agreements provide two revenue streams  consisting of an initial license fee and a monthly revenue based royalty fee based on monthly revenue and sales from ancillary products of the games 
the initial license fee is based on both a fixed amount and additional amounts receivable upon the games achieving certain sales targets 
since changyou is obligated to provide post sales services such as technical support and provision of updates and when and if available upgrades to the licensees during the license period  the initial license fee from the licensing arrangement is recognized as revenue ratably over the license period 
the fixed amount of the initial license fee is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the launch of the game and the additional amount is recognized ratably over the remaining license period from the date when such additional amount is certain 
the monthly revenue based royalty fee is recognized when relevant services are delivered  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
wireless revenues our wireless revenues are generated from the provision of mobile related services through different types of wireless products to mobile phone users

we obtain fees from the china mobile network operators  which charge users on a monthly or per message download basis for wireless services we provide 
after the receipt of service fees from china mobile network operators  we make payments to third party wireless service alliance and content providers based on revenue sharing arrangements 
currently  a majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis  as we have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services 
wireless revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided that no significant obligations remain 
for the amount of revenues to be recognized  we rely on billing confirmations issued by the china mobile network operators 
if at the end of each reporting period  an operator has not yet issued such billing confirmations  we estimate the amount of collectable wireless service fees and recognize revenue 
when we later receive billing confirmations  we record a true up accounting adjustment 
for the three months ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by billing confirmations received from the china mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  we receive billing confirmations from the operators and ii within to days after delivering billing confirmations  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  to us 
others revenues others revenues are primarily generated from sub licensing of licensed video content operated by sohu  ivas provided by sogou with respect to web games developed by third party developers  and cinema advertising services provided by changyou 
revenues from sub licensing of licensed video content for licensed video content purchased on an exclusive basis with payment in cash  we have rights to sub license to other platforms 
revenues from sub licensing of licensed video content are recognized when the content is available for immediate and unconditional delivery under an existing sub licensing arrangement  the sub license period has begun and the sub licensing fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the sub licensing fee is reasonably assured 
revenues from ivas sogou offers web games developed by third party developers and generate revenues from the provision of ivas  including promotion  access maintenance and payment services  to third party developers 
the web games can be accessed and played by end users free of charge  but the end users may choose to purchase in game merchandise to enhance their game playing experience

depending on the terms of a customer contract  fees for services performed can be recognized according to two principal methods  consisting of the proportional performance method and the straight line method 
under the proportional performance method  fees are generally recognized based on a percentage of the advertising slots actually delivered where the fee is earned on a per advertising slot placement basis

table of contents share based compensation expense sohu  changyou  sogou  fox video limited sohu video and road all have incentive plans for the granting of share based awards  including common stock ordinary shares  share options  restricted shares and restricted share units  to their executive officers  management and employees 
share based compensation expense is recognized as costs and or expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on the fair value of the related share based awards on their grant dates 
share based compensation expense is charged to the shareholders equity or noncontrolling interest section in the consolidated balance sheets 
the assumptions used in share based compensation expense recognition represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change or different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different for any period 
moreover  the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes 
share based compensation expense related to sohu  changyou  and sogou share based awards for sohu share based awards  in determining the fair value of share options granted  the black scholes valuation model is applied  in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted  the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
for changyou share based awards  in determining the fair value of ordinary shares  restricted shares and restricted share units granted in  the income approach discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied  given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted in before changyou s initial public offering  the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on changyou s offering price for its initial public offering 
in determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after changyou s initial public offering  the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied 
for sogou share based awards  in determining the fair value of share options granted  the income approach discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability was applied  given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant 
share based compensation expense for the ordinary shares granted is fully recognized in the quarter during which these ordinary shares are granted 
for share options  restricted shares and restricted share units granted with respect to sohu shares and with respect to changyou shares  compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
for share options granted with respect to sogou shares  compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period during which the service period requirement and performance target will be met 
the number of share based awards for which the service is not expected to be rendered over the requisite period is estimated  and the related compensation expense is not recorded for that number of awards 
sohu video share based awards on january   sohu video  the holding entity of sohu s video division  adopted a share incentive plan the video share incentive plan which provides for the issuance of up to  ordinary shares of sohu video amounting to of the outstanding sohu video shares on a fully diluted basis to management and key employees of the video division and to sohu management 
as of december   grants of options for the purchase of  of ordinary shares of sohu video had been made and were effective under the plan 
however  as of december   the restructuring of sohu s video division was still in process and certain significant factors remained uncertain 
for purposes of asc  no grant date is established until mutual understanding of the option awards key terms and conditions between sohu video and the recipients can be reached  and such mutual understanding cannot be reached until the video division s restructuring plan has been substantially fixed  so that the enterprise value of sohu video and hence the fair value of the options is determinable and can be accounted for 
as a result  on the basis that the broader terms and conditions of the option awards had neither been finalized nor mutually agreed with the recipients  no grant of options occurred for purposes of asc and hence no share based compensation expense was recognized for the year ended december  
table of contents road share based awards on july   road adopted a share incentive plan the road share incentive plan  which initially provided for the issuance to selected directors  officers  employees  consultants and advisors of road of up to  ordinary shares of road amounting to of the then outstanding road shares on a fully diluted basis 
on november   road board of directors and its shareholders approved an increase from  to  ordinary shares amounting to of the then outstanding road shares on a fully diluted basis under the road share incentive plan 
as of december    restricted share units had been granted under the plan 
such restricted share units will not be vested until road s completion of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering the ipo of its shares resulting in a listing on an internationally recognized exchange and the expiration of all underwriters lockup periods applicable to the ipo 
the completion of a firm commitment ipo is considered to be a performance condition of the awards 
an ipo event is not considered to be probable until it is completed 
under asc  compensation cost should be accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and should not be accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
as a result  no compensation expense will be recognized relating to these restricted share units until the completion of an ipo  and hence no share based compensation expense was recognized for the year ended december  taxation income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on available evidence  it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future profitability  and tax planning strategies 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
if events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting basis and tax basis for our china based subsidiaries and vies  which are subject to corporate income tax in the prc under the prc corporate income tax law the cit law 
prc withholding tax on dividends the cit law imposes a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises to their immediate holding companies outside mainland china 
a lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty between mainland china and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company 
a holding company in hong kong  for example  will be subject to a withholding tax rate under the arrangement between the prc and the hong kong special administrative region on the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital  the china hk tax arrangement  if such holding company is considered a non prc resident enterprise and holds at least of the equity interests in the prc foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends  subject to approval of the prc local tax authority 
however  if the hong kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable prc tax regulations  such dividend may remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 
uncertain tax positions in order to assess uncertain tax positions  we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition 
for the two step approach  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
transition from prc business tax to prc value added tax effective september   the pilot program  for transition from the imposition of business tax to the imposition of vat for revenues from certain industries was expanded from shanghai to eight other cities and provinces in china  including beijing and tianjin 
our brand advertising and search revenues are subject to this program 

table of contents business tax had been imposed primarily on revenues from the provision of taxable services  assignments of intangible assets and transfers of real estate 
prior to the implementation of the pilot program  our business tax rate  which varies depending upon the nature of the revenues being taxed  generally ranged from to 
vat payable on goods sold or taxable labor services provided by a general vat taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output vat for the period after crediting the input vat for the period 
before the implementation of the pilot program  we were mainly subject to a small amount of vat for revenues of changyou s subsidiary road that are deemed for prc tax purposes to be derived from the sale of software 
vat has been imposed on those road revenues at a rate of  with a immediate tax refund  resulting in a net rate of 
with the implementation of the pilot program  in addition to the road revenues  our brand advertising and search revenues are now subject to vat at a rate of 
under asc  the presentation of taxes on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision determined by management 
as vat imposed on brand adverting and search revenues and vat imposed on road s revenues from the sale of software are considered as substantially different in nature  we determined that it is reasonable to apply the guidance separately for these two types of vat 
the basis for this determination is that vat payable on brand advertising and search revenues is the difference between the output vat at a rate of and available input vat amount at the rate applicable to the supplier  which is a component of our costs for providing the brand advertising and search services 
on the other hand  vat payable by road is in effect at of the applicable revenues from the sale of software  irrespective of the availability of any input vat  under preferential vat treatment provided to road by the local tax bureau 
in this regard  we believe the vat payable by road is more akin to a sales tax than typical vat 
as a result  we adopted the net presentation method for our brand advertising and search businesses both before and after the implementation of the pilot program  and for the revenues of road deemed to be derived from the sale of software  we adopted the gross presentation method before and after the implementation of the pilot program 
the implementation of the pilot program has not had a significant impact on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended december  net income per share basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and  if dilutive  potential common shares outstanding during the period 
potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards 
potential common shares are accounted for in the computation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method 
the dilutive effect of share based awards with performance requirements is not considered before the performance targets are actually met 
the computation of diluted net income per share does not assume conversion  exercise  or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti dilutive effect ie  an increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts on net income per share 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the numerator of diluted net income per share  the net income attributable to sohu is adjusted as follows changyou s net income attributable to sohu is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of changyou shares held by sohu represents of the weighted average number of changyou ordinary shares and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards under the treasury stock method  instead of by the percentage held by sohu of the total economic interest in changyou  which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share 
sogou s net income loss attributable to sohu is determined using the percentage that the weighted average number of sogou shares held by sohu represents of the weighted average number of sogou ordinary shares and series a preferred shares  shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible preferred shares under the if converted method  and shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share based awards under the treasury stock method  instead of by sogou s net income loss allocated to sohu by virtue of the sogou series a terms  the terms of the restructuring and sohu s purchase of sogou series a preferred shares from alibaba  which is used for the calculation of basic net income per share 
fair value of financial instruments us gaap establishes a three tier hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value of financial instruments 
this hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the three tier fair value hierarchy is level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place 
level unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity 
our financial instruments include cash equivalents  restricted time deposits  short term investments  accounts receivable  investments in debt securities  prepaid and other current assets  prepaid non current assets  accounts payable  short term bank loans  accrued liabilities  receipts in advance and deferred revenue  other short term liabilities  long term accounts payable and long term bank loans 

table of contents cash equivalents our cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits placed with banks with an original maturity of three months or less 
restricted time deposits changyou bridge loans from offshore banks  secured by time deposits the bridge loans from the offshore branches of the lending banks are classified as short term bank loans or long term bank loans based on their repayment period 
the rates of interest under the loan agreements with the lending banks were determined based on the prevailing interest rates in the market 
the rmb onshore deposits securing the offshore loans are treated as restricted time deposits on our consolidated balance sheets 
restricted time deposits are valued based on the prevailing interest rates in the market 
short term investments for investments in financial instruments with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets  we elected the fair value method at the date of initial recognition and carried these investments subsequently at fair value 
changes in the fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
accounts receivable  net the carrying value of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
we make estimations of the collectability of accounts receivable 
many factors are considered in estimating the general allowance  including reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  performing an aging analysis and a customer credit analysis  and analyzing historical bad debt records and current economic trends 
additional allowance for specific doubtful accounts might be made if the financial conditions of our customers or the china mobile network operators deteriorate or the china mobile network operators are unable to collect fees from their end customers  resulting in their inability to make payments due to us 
investments in debt securities we invest our excess cash in certain debt securities of high quality corporate issuers 
we elected the fair value option to account for our investments in debt securities at their initial recognition 
changes in the fair value are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as other income expense 
the fair value election was made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications 
equity investments investments in entities over which we do not have significant influence are recorded as equity investments and are accounted for by the cost method 
investments in entities over which we have significant influence but do not control are also recorded as equity investments and are accounted for by the equity method 
under the equity method  our share of the post acquisition profits or losses of the equity investment is recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income  and our share of post acquisition movements in equity investments is recognized in equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains on transactions between us and our equity investees are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the equity investments 
unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred 
when our share of losses in an equity investment equals or exceeds our interest in the equity investment  we do not recognize further losses  unless we have incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the equity investee 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  intangible assets and prepaid non current assets 
fixed assets fixed assets mainly comprise office building  leasehold improvements  vehicles  office furniture  and computer equipment and hardware 
fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives listed below 
fixed assets estimated useful lives years office building leasehold improvements lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets vehicles office furniture computer equipment and hardware 
table of contents expenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred 
the gain or loss on the disposal of fixed assets is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell the relevant assets and is recognized in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
intangible assets intangible assets mainly comprise video content and license  customer lists  developed technologies  computer software purchased from unrelated third parties  domain names and trademarks  and operating rights for licensed games 
intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization with no residual value 
amortization of intangible assets other than licensed video content is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we amortize licensed video content over the shorter of the term of the estimated period over which the benefits of the license agreement will be enjoyed based on the trend of accumulation of viewership or the applicable license period 
beginning in the third quarter of  licensed video content is amortized on an accelerated basis based on the viewership accumulation trend over the shorter of the term of the estimated period over which the benefits of the license contract will be enjoyed or the applicable license period 
for exclusively licensed video content which we sub licensed to similar platforms in return for payment in cash  we allocate a portion of the video content cost from cost of brand advertising revenues to sub licensing cost 
the allocation is based on the revenues to be generated through sub licensing 
we amortize sub licensing cost using the individual film forecast computation method  which amortizes such costs in the same ratio that actual sub licensing revenue bears as of the current period end to the total of the actual revenue earned and the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue 
prepaid non current assets prepaid non current assets primarily include prepayments for the office buildings to be built as our and changyou s headquarters before they are recognized as fixed assets  prepayments for the technological infrastructure and fitting out of our office building before they are recognized as fixed assets  and prepaid prc income tax arising from the sale of certain assets associated with the business of com the business by us to changyou 
since the sale of the business was between entities that are included in our consolidated financial statements  it was considered an intra entity transaction and  under asc  income taxes paid should be deferred 
accordingly  we recorded income tax related to the sale of the business as prepaid prc income tax 
the prepaid prc income tax will be amortized over the period of the weighted average remaining life of the business related assets sold to changyou 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets using the projected discounted cash flow method at the asset group level 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant management judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors 
the discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model is determined by our management 
an impairment loss would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
we noted that prices for purchased video content decreased significantly in the second quarter of we considered this is an indicator of impairment  and accordingly we performed an impairment test for our purchased video content at the asset group level 
we divided purchased video content into seven asset groups  consisting of tv series  pay channel  overseas content  movies  animations  variety shows  and documentary films 
we tested the recoverability of the carrying values of these asset groups by comparing their carrying amounts to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset groups 
if the carrying amount of an asset group was determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss was recognized  measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the asset group s fair value 
the fair values of the purchased video content were estimated using the discounted cash flow method 
the impairment losses were allocated only to the purchased video content within the asset group  since the carrying amount of other long lived assets within the asset group was considered to be already below their fair value 
we did not note any indicators in the second half year of that would result in any further impairment of long lived assets related to video content 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries and consolidated vies 

table of contents we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of october  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired 
commencing in september  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb revised guidance on testing of goodwill for impairment 
under this guidance  we have the option to choose whether we will apply the qualitative assessment first and then the quantitative assessment  if necessary  or to apply the quantitative assessment directly 
for reporting units applying a qualitative assessment first  we start the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is mandatory 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
for reporting units directly applying the quantitative assessment  we perform the goodwill impairment test by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
contingent consideration the agreement for changyou s acquisition of a majority interest in road includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by changyou based on the financial performance of road through december  the range of the undiscounted amounts changyou could pay under the contingent consideration agreement is between nil and million 
fair value of the contingent consideration of million was recognized on the date of the acquisition  with the income approach applied 
there were no indemnification assets involved 
as of the end of  road had exceeded the financial performance milestones  as a result of which changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration of million were recognized in other income expense for the year ended december  mezzanine equity on may   changyou  through its vie gamease  acquired of the equity interests of shenzhen road technology co  ltd shenzhen road and began to consolidate shenzhen road financial statements on june  our mezzanine equity consists of noncontrolling interest in road and a put option pursuant to which the noncontrolling shareholders will have the right to put their equity interests in road to changyou at a pre determined price if road achieves specified performance milestones before the expiry of the put option and road does not complete an initial public offering on nasdaq  nyse or hkex 
the put option will expire in since the occurrence of the sale is not solely within the control of changyou  we classify the noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity instead of permanent equity in our and changyou s consolidated financial statements 
under asc  we calculate  on an accumulative basis from the acquisition date  i the amount of accretion that would increase the balance of noncontrolling interest to its estimated redemption value over the period from the date of the shenzhen road acquisition to the earliest redemption date of the noncontrolling interest in road and ii the amount of net profit attributable to noncontrolling shareholders of road based on their ownership percentage 
the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity will be adjusted by an accumulative amount equal to the higher of i and ii 
on june   road s chief executive officer surrendered to road  without consideration  ordinary shares of road representing of the then outstanding ordinary shares of road  with the intention that these shares would be added to the shares reserved by road for grants of equity incentive awards under the road share incentive plan without dilution of the other shareholders of road 
as a result  the noncontrolling interest decreased to of road and changyou s interest in road increased to 
under asc  changes in a parent ownership interest while the parent retains control of its subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions  and do not impact net income or comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements 
the variance of million caused by road s chief executive officer s surrender of shares was recorded as credit to additional paid in capital 
for the year ended december   road had exceeded the specified performance milestones set forth in the acquisition agreement for changyou s acquisition of a majority interest in road  and accordingly the estimated redemption value of the noncontrolling interests in road increased 
the increase in the redemption value was recognized over the period from the date of management s increased estimate to the earliest exercise date of the put right as an increase in net income attributable to mezzanine classified noncontrolling interests

restrictions on cash transfers to sohu 
com inc to fund any cash requirements it may have  sohu 
com inc may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by sohu 
com limited and changyou 
com limited  our wholly owned subsidiary and majority owned subsidiary 
since substantially all of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly owned and majority owned china based subsidiaries and vies  sohu 
com limited and changyou 
com limited may need to rely on dividends  loans or advances made by our prc subsidiaries 
in  changyou s board of directors decided to cause one of changyou s prc subsidiaries to distribute all of its earnings to its overseas parent company  changyou hk 
on september   changyou paid out a special cash dividend of million  with million paid to and received by sohu 
in the million  million was paid to and received by sohu 
com limited and million was paid to and received by sohu 
com inc the cash transfers to sohu 
com inc are subject to certain restrictions  such as the prc company s profit appropriation required by the prc law  the prc foreign currency exchange regulations  prc tax and us tax regulations  as well as the restrictions related to our vie structures 
however  we do not expect any of such restrictions or taxes to have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
prc profit appropriation  withholding tax on dividends and foreign currency exchange regulation regulations in the prc currently permit payment of dividends of a prc company only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in china 
our china based subsidiaries  which are wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoes  are also required to set aside at least of their after tax profit based on prc accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the cumulative amount reaches of their paid in capital 
these reserves are not distributable as cash dividends  or as loans or advances 
these wfoes may also allocate a portion of their after tax profits  at the discretion of their boards of directors  to their staff welfare and bonus funds 
any amounts so allocated may not be distributed to sohu 
com limited and or changyou 
com limited  accordingly  would not be available for distribution to sohu 
com inc the prc corporate income tax law imposes a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by wfoes to their immediate holding companies outside mainland china 
a lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland china and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company 
a holding company in hong kong  for example  will be subject to a withholding tax rate under the arrangement between the prc and the hong kong special administrative region on the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital the china hk tax arrangement if such holding company is considered a non prc resident enterprise and holds at least of the equity interests in the prc foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends  subject to approval of the prc local tax authority 
however  if the hong kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable prc tax regulations  such dividend may remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 
for the aforementioned distribution plan in which one of changyou s prc subsidiaries would distribute dividend to changyou hk  based on an assessment performed pursuant to requirements specified by prc tax authorities  changyou concluded that it was more likely than not that such distribution would be subject to withholding tax 
for the year ended december   changyou accrued deferred tax liabilities in the amount of million for withholding taxes associated with this dividend distribution plan 
under regulations of the state administration of foreign exchange safe in china  the rmb is not convertible into foreign currencies for capital account items  such as loans  repatriation of investments and investments outside of china  unless prior approval of the safe is obtained and prior registration with the safe is made 
us tax regulation sohu 
com inc is a delaware corporation and its income is subject to income taxes in the united states us at a rate of up to 
as sohu 
com inc has no substantial operations and earns little income in the united states  its taxable income is near negligible and so is its us income tax due 
sohu 
com inc is also subject to us income tax on any deemed dividends from its non us subsidiaries  as discussed below 

table of contents the majority of the subsidiaries and vies of the sohu 
com inc are based in mainland china and are subject to income taxes in the prc 
these china based subsidiaries and vies conduct substantially all of the sohu group s operations  and generate most of the sohu group s income 
non us companies  such as sohu 
com inc s non us subsidiaries and vies  are generally not subject to us income taxes unless they conduct a trade or business in the united states themselves 
however  if a controlled foreign corporation cfc  such as the non us subsidiaries and vies of sohu 
com inc  with respect to a us shareholder  such as sohu 
com inc  earns certain passive and certain related party income  called subpart f income  such income is deemed as a dividend to sohu 
com inc  subject to us income tax even though no actual dividend is paid to sohu 
com inc subpart f income includes interest income from third parties earned by sohu 
com inc s cfcs 
hence  the interest income earned by sohu s and changyou s china based subsidiaries and vies is subpart f income  includible in sohu 
com inc s taxable income 
moreover  sohu 
com limited and changyou 
com limited are regarded as separate entities for us tax purposes  and certain transactions between sohu 
com limited and changyou 
com limited 
as well as between their subsidiaries and vies may generate related party income  another type of subpart f income  includible in sohu 
com inc s taxable income 
in addition  certain transactions between changyou 
com limited  its non us subsidiaries and vies on the one hand and changyou 
com inc us on the other could constitute a cfc s investment in us property  also giving rise to deemed dividends to sohu

com inc 
s taxable income 
if changyou 
com limited pays dividends to its shareholders  including sohu  such dividends are generally subpart f income  includible in sohu 
com inc s taxable income unless an exception applies 
under one such exception  the cfc look through rule  the special cash dividend sohu received from changyou in september should not be includible in sohu 
com inc s taxable income 
under certain circumstances  when sohu sells changyou adss originally held by sohu at a price higher than its us tax basis  a portion of the proceeds could be subpart f income  subjecting sohu 
com inc to us tax at or 
as most of the income earned by the non us subsidiaries and vies of sohu 
com inc is not subpart f income  sohu 
com inc 
is only required to include in its taxable income a small amount of its non us subsidiaries income that is subpart f income 
as sohu 
com inc has net operating loss exceeding such subpart f income  sohu 
com inc does not owe much us tax 
subpart f income once includible in sohu 
com inc s taxable income becomes previously taxed income pti and actual dividends made out of pti will not be taxed a second time 
moreover  according to asc  sohu 
com inc does not provide for us federal income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of its international subsidiaries or consolidated vies because in the foreseeable future sohu 
com inc does not have the intention to repatriate those undistributed earnings or losses to us where it would be subject to us corporate income tax  except that  under certain circumstances  sohu 
com inc may repatriate to the us income that will be subject to us alternative minimum tax

restriction related to vie structure for sohu except for changyou  although the vies generate revenue and cash  due to significant costs involved in their operations  almost all the vies are incur deficits  and their operating cash flow was negative for the year ended december  substantially all of changyou s operations are conducted through changyou s vies  which generated all of changyou s online game revenues 
although changyou s subsidiaries received a majority of the vies profits pursuant to the various contractual agreements between the vies and the subsidiaries  significant cash balances remained in changyou s vies as of december  as changyou s vies are not owned by changyou s subsidiaries  they are not able to make dividend payments to changyou s subsidiaries 
instead  changyou s prc subsidiaries have entered into a number of contracts with its corresponding vie to provide services to such vie in return for cash payments 
in order for sohu 
com inc and or changyou 
com limited to receive any dividends  loans or advances from changyou s prc subsidiaries  or to distribute any dividends to sohu 
com inc shareholders and or changyou 
com limited s ads holders  we will need to rely on these payments made from these vies to changyou s prc subsidiaries 
depending on the nature of services provided by changyou s prc subsidiaries to their corresponding vies  certain of these payments are subject to prc taxes  including business tax and vat  which effectively reduce the amount that a prc subsidiary receives from its corresponding vie 
in addition  the prc government could impose restrictions on such payments or change the tax rates applicable to such payments

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued revised guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the revised guidance applies to all entities  both public and nonpublic  that have indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  reported in their financial statements 
under the revised guidance  an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with subtopic an entity also has the option to bypass a qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
in conducting a qualitative assessment  an entity should consider the extent to which relevant events and circumstances  both individually and in the aggregate  could have affected the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset since the last assessment 
an entity also should consider whether there have been changes to the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
an entity should consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that could affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
we are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance 
in february  the fasb issued revised guidance on comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the revised guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
however  the revised guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the revised guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  for public entities 
the revised guidance will not have a material effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the rmb depreciates relative to the us dollar 
the rmb is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
in addition  commencing on july   china reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
under the managed floating exchange rate regime  the rmb is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of the rmb against the us dollar was adjusted to rmb per us dollar as of july   representing an appreciation of about 
the people s bank of china will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies such as the us dollar traded against the rmb in the inter bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day  and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the rmb on the following business day 
on may   the people s bank of china announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of rmb trading prices against the us dollar in the inter bank spot foreign exchange market from to 
while the international reactions to the rmb revaluation and widening of the rmb s daily trading band have generally been positive  with the increased floating range of the rmb s value against foreign currencies  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued 

table of contents on june   the people s bank of china announced that it has decided to proceed further with the reform of the rmb exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the rmb exchange rate and that emphasis would be placed on reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies 
while so indicating its intention to make the rmb s exchange rate more flexible  the people s bank of china ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the currency or a one off adjustment 
as a result of the announcement  the rmb has appreciated significantly

in the long term  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate more significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies depending on the market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth a summary of our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments as of december   which consisted of cash and cash equivalents  restricted time deposits  short term investments  investments in debt securities  accounts receivable  prepaid and other current assets  current liabilities  long term accounts payable and long term bank loans

under the investment policy  our excess cash is invested in high quality securities which are limited as to length of time to maturity and the amount of credit exposure 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated from excess cash invested in demand deposits and debt securities  and interest expense generated from changyou s bridge loans from offshore banks 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio in order to reduce this risk 
we have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates
