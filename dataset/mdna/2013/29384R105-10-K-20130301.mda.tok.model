the entropic platform is at the heart of the digital entertainment ecosystem connecting technologies  applications  services and people 
looking specifically at products  we offer a diverse portfolio of stb soc and connectivity solutions that include the following stb soc solutions we added stb soc solutions to our product offerings in april  when we completed the acquisition of assets related to the stb business of trident microsystems  inc  or trident 
the acquired assets included a diverse stb product portfolio  comprised of a comprehensive suite of digital stb components and system solutions for the worldwide satellite  terrestrial  cable and ip television  or iptv  markets 
our stb products primarily consist of stb socs  but also include docsis modems  interface devices and media processors 
in addition to traditional standard definition  or sd  stbs and advanced high definition  or hd  stbs  many of these products feature arm application processor based socs that have been optimized for leading web technologies 
connectivity solutions our connectivity solutions enable access to broadcast and iptv services as well as deliver and distribute other media content  such as movies  music  games and photos  throughout the home and include home networking solutions based on the moca standard which use existing coaxial cable to create a robust ip based network for easy sharing of hd video and other multimedia content throughout the home  
table of contents high speed broadband access solutions which use coaxial cable infrastructure to deliver last few hundred meter connectivity for high speed broadband access to single family homes and multiple dwelling units  and direct broadcast satellite outdoor unit  or dbs odu  solutions which consist of our band translation switch  or bts  and channel stacking switch  or css  products which simplify the installation required to support simultaneous reception of multiple channels from multiple satellites over a single cable 
adding to its breadth of dbs odu offerings  in july  we acquired specific direct broadcast satellite intellectual property and corresponding technologies from plx technology  inc the purchased assets provided an accelerated roadmap for our digital channel stacking switch  or dcss  semiconductor product  which will ultimately lead toward highly integrated products that incorporate broadband capture and ip output 
our products allow telecommunications carriers  cable operators  dbs odu  over the air  and over the top  or ott  service providers  which we collectively refer to as service providers  to enhance and expand their service offerings and reduce deployment costs in an increasingly competitive environment 
our stb soc and connectivity solutions are now being deployed into consumer homes to support advanced services such as multi room dvr  hd video calling  and ott content delivery 
our products are deployed by major service providers globally  including comcast  cox communications  directv  dish network  ocn china  time warner cable  topway china  upc netherlands and verizon  as well as by a number of smaller service providers 
we have extensive core competencies in video communications  networking algorithms and protocols  soc design  embedded software  mixed signal and radio frequency integrated circuit design  and communications and radio frequency systems 
we use our considerable experience with service provider based deployments to create solutions that address the complex requirements associated with delivering multiple streams of hd video into and throughout the home and processing those video streams for display on televisions or other devices in the home 
since making two transformative acquisitions in  we updated our brand identity in january  to represent the significant shift in our overall vision  look and message 
the corporate logo was modernized to reflect the newly integrated company 
under the new brand identity  we dropped communications from our name in all new marketing communications programs 
since inception  we have invested heavily in product development and have only achieved profitability on an annual basis for the first time in with net income of million 
for the years ended december  and net income was million and million  respectively 
over the past two years  we have seen our revenues increase from million in to million in and to million in the increase in net revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the additional revenues generated by the stb soc solutions that we acquired from trident in april  as well as an increase in the demand for our connectivity solutions during the year ended december  the annual revenue increase in was primarily due to the increased demand for our connectivity solutions  which was directly related to the increased deployment of our products into consumer homes by satellite and cable operators 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we generate the majority of our revenues from sales of our semiconductor solutions to original design manufacturers  or odms  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that provide customer premises equipment to service providers 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and reduce the price of our products over time  as market and competitive 
table of contents conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues 
sales to these customers are in turn driven by service providers that purchase our customers products which incorporate our semiconductor solutions 
a substantial percentage of our net revenues are dependent upon six major service providers comcast  cox communications  directv  dish network  time warner cable and verizon 
in addition  we are dependent on sales outside of the united states for almost all of our net revenues and expect that to continue in the future 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
this outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  sales and marketing of our semiconductor solutions and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars as we develop additional semiconductor solutions and expand our business  and to fluctuate over the course of the year based on the timing of our development tools and supply costs  which include outside services  masks costs and software licenses 
we also anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our domestic and international sales and marketing organization and activities and build brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales and marketing expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from the related products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for investment in a privately held company  stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
table of contents revenue recognition our net revenues are generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
during the years ended december   and  product net revenues represented more than of our total net revenues 
our sales primarily occur through the efforts of our direct sales force 
the remainder of our sales occurs through third party sales representatives and distributors 
during the year ended december   of our sales occurred through the efforts of our direct sales force 
during the years ended december  and  more than of our sales occurred through the efforts of our direct sales force 
we recognize product revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  however  we do not recognize revenue until all substantive customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
a portion of our sales is made through distributors  agents or customers acting as agents under agreements allowing for rights of return or other potential concessions 
net revenues on sales made through these distributors are not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
revenues derived from billing customers for shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of net revenues 
costs of shipping and handling charged by suppliers are classified as a component of cost of net revenues 
we record reductions to net revenues for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and other factors known at the time 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  such differences would be recorded in our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
to date  changes in estimated returns have not been material to net revenues in any related period 
we are party to an inventory hubbing agreement with motorola mobility  inc formerly motorola  inc  or motorola 
pursuant to this agreement  we deliver products to the designated third party warehouse based upon motorola s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until motorola removes our products from the third party warehouse to incorporate into its own products 
we receive royalties in exchange for an exclusive right to manufacture and sell certain products 
we have determined that we are not able to reliably estimate the royalties earned in the period the sales occur and  as a result  we record net revenues based on cash receipts 
the royalty revenues recorded during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and are included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we have entered into agreements to license certain hardware and software  also referred to as the nodes  to certain members of the moca for a period of three years and to provide upgrades when and if they become available 
the agreements limit the rights to use the nodes to test compliance of the members own products to the moca specification 
for these arrangements  we defer all of the license revenues when the nodes are delivered and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the three year term of the agreement 
to date  revenues under these arrangements have not been material 

table of contents we provide rebates on our products to certain customers 
at the time of the sale  we accrue of the potential rebate as a reduction to net revenue and do not apply a breakage factor  based on our historical experience rate 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in various rebate agreements 
we reverse the accrual for unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
for the years ended december   and  we reduced net revenue by million  million and million  respectively  in connection with our rebate programs 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
lower of cost or market adjustments reduce the carrying value of the related inventory and take into consideration reductions in sales prices  excess inventory levels and obsolete inventory 
these adjustments are calculated on a part by part basis and  in general  represent excess inventory value on hand compared to month demand projections 
once established  these adjustments are considered permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or disposed 
we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million  million and million  respectively 
we have entered into a capacity agreement with one of our third party foundry contractors in order to guarantee minimum capacity volumes on our dbs odu solutions 
pursuant to the capacity agreement  we have made prepayments which will result in reduced prices paid on future inventory purchases up to a specified volume 
the prepayments are being amortized into the cost of our inventory purchases based on the specified volume commitments under the terms of the capacity agreement and our estimated purchases over the period if less than the specified volume 
the prepaid inventory volume commitments are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the remaining prepaid balance to our estimate of remaining purchases 
there have been no impairments to date 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and other intangible assets based on the fair value of the assets acquired 
in determining the fair value of the assets acquired  we utilize extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of the year  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we perform an interim goodwill impairment test when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
we operate as one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the reporting unit s fair value to its net book value 
if the fair value is less than the book value  the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we would recognize an 
table of contents impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including the size and timing of deployments by our customers and related projections and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  stage of products in development  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
as of december   we had million of goodwill related to our acquisition of trident and million of goodwill related to our acquisition of certain assets of plx 
investment in a privately held company we account for our investment in a privately held company under the equity method of accounting since we exercise significant influence  but we do not have the elements of control that would require consolidation 
the rights of the other investors are both protective and participating 
unless we are determined to be the primary beneficiary  these rights preclude us from consolidating the investment 
the investment is recorded initially at cost as an investment in a privately held company  and subsequently is adjusted for equity in net income and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of the investment on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is evaluated for impairment at each reporting period 
as of december  our investment in a privately held company was million  which is included in other long term assets on our balance sheet 
stock based compensation we have equity incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and restricted stock units and non qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non employees 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we have no stock based compensation awards with market or performance conditions 
the stock based compensation expense attributable to awards under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we also grant awards to non employees and determine the fair value of such stock based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used  it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached  or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is completed 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with stock based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 

table of contents income taxes we estimate income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we estimate the current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are reflected in our balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when a valuation allowance is established or increased  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statements of operations 
when a valuation allowance is decreased  we record the corresponding tax benefit in our statements of operations 
we review the need for a valuation allowance each interim period to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance analysis is based on estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
during the fourth quarter of we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our federal deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets by million at december  we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to offset the california deferred tax assets as realization of such assets does not meet the more likely than not threshold required under accounting guidance given the present lower apportionment factors now pertaining to our income taxes in california 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has more than a chance of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
the evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
segment reporting we are organized as  and operate in  one reportable segment the design  development and sale of silicon integrated circuits 
products within this segment are embedded in electronic devices used to enable the delivery of multiple streams of hd video and other multimedia content for entertainment purposes into and throughout the home 
our chief executive officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purpose of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources 
there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations below the 
table of contents consolidated financial statement level 
our assets are primarily located in the united states and not allocated to any specific region 
therefore  geographic information is presented only for total revenue

this update amends accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurement and disclosure 
asu clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
asu is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december  we have adopted asu effective january  and the application of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we have adopted asu effective january  the adoption of asu concerns presentation and disclosure only and does not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
there have been no other recent accounting standards  or changes in accounting standards  during the year ended december   that are of material significance  or have potential material significance to us

table of contents net revenues 
we generate the majority of our revenues from sales of our products to odms or oems that provide customer premises equipment to service providers 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and reduce the price of our products over time  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues 
sales to these customers are in turn driven by service providers that purchase our customers products which incorporate our semiconductor solutions 
for the years ended december   and  four customers accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
a substantial percentage of our net revenues are dependent upon six major service providers comcast  cox communications  directv  dish network  time warner cable and verizon 
since inception  we have derived our net revenues primarily from asia  the united states and other north american countries 
net revenues are allocated to the geographic region based on the shipping destination of customer orders 
for sales to odms and oems  their geographic locations may differ from those of the ultimate end customers 
of our million in net revenues in  million  million and million were derived from asia  north america and europe  respectively

cost of net revenues 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
to a lesser extent  cost of net revenues includes expenses relating to management of our contractors  the cost of shipping and logistics  royalties  inventory valuation charges taken for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs  changes in product cost due to changes in wafer manufacturing  assembly and test yields  allocated facilities expenses  amortization of inventory step up and acquired developed technology 
we currently outsource the manufacturing of our stb soc  home networking and broadband access products  principally to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and united microelectronics corporation and the manufacturing of our dbs outdoor unit products to towerjazz  the name under which tower semiconductor ltd 
and its fully owned us subsidiary jazz semiconductor operate 
our products are shipped from such third party foundries to third party assembly and testing facilities 
our stb soc  home networking and our broadband access chipsets are primarily assembled and tested by amkor technologies  inc  or amkor  advanced semiconductor engineering group  or ase group and nxp semiconductors  or nxp  while our dbs outdoor unit products are primarily assembled by amkor and tested by giga solution tech 
co  ltd  or giga solution 
in september  we entered into a capacity commitment agreement with towerjazz in order to guarantee minimum capacity volumes on our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner products through december   which was not renewed 
gross margin 
in  as a result of our acquisition of the stb business from trident our gross margins were impacted by sales of lower margin products associated with this business  partially offset by a positive impact from lower unit costs of our connectivity solutions  principally as a result of more favorable manufacturing costs 
our gross margins increased in as compared to  primarily due to decreased unit costs of our home networking chipsets principally as a result of more

included in cost of net revenues for the years ended december   and was the amortization of developed technology of million  million and million  respectively  which resulted from our stb business and rf magic acquisitions 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including declines in selling prices of our products  especially as competition increases over time  product mix  the timing of cost reductions for fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs  inventory valuation charges  purchase accounting related charges  and changes in wafer manufacturing  assembly and test yields 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  third party services that consist primarily of contract labor services  fabrication masks  architecture licenses  engineering design development software and hardware tools  allocated facilities expenses and depreciation of equipment used in research and development 
while a substantial portion of our research and development activities are undertaken in support of our current and anticipated customers  we also invest in research and development to develop our technology 
in the future  we expect some of the services currently performed by contractors to be performed internally 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our development tools and supply costs  which include third party services  masks costs and licenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  sales commissions  trade shows  marketing programs  depreciation and allocated facilities expenses 
we plan to continue to increase the size of our sales and marketing organization to enable us to expand into existing and new markets 
we also plan to continue to invest in expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities and build brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from these products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  accounting and tax  legal compliance and allocated support expenses

if we were to raise additional capital through further sales of our equity securities  our stockholders would suffer dilution of their equity ownership

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which our customers operate could materially affect the demand of our products by non us customers  leading to a reduction in orders placed by these customers  which would adversely affect our business 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in numerous currencies 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the most significant to our operations for the year ended december  were the chinese yuan  the british pound  the taiwanese dollar  the indian rupee and the south korean won 
we have established a foreign currency risk management program to protect against the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this program reduces  but does not eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
our foreign currency risk management program includes foreign currency derivatives that utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposures to the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated non us dollar denominated cash flows 
these instruments generally have a maturity of less than one year 
the fair value of these contracts is reflected as other assets or other liabilities and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income  net to largely offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income  net 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts in place that amounted to a net purchase in us dollar equivalent of approximately million to partially hedge our expected future expenses related to funding our china operations costs 
the maturities of these contracts were less than months 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately million in losses in earnings or cash flows 
interest rate risk we typically maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in deposits and money market funds with major financial institutions  us government obligations and debt securities of corporations with strong credit ratings in a variety of industries that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
all of our fixed income investments are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments are subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  all of which were stated at fair value 
a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates over a three month period would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of the million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december   as these consisted of securities 
table of contents with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the fair value of the million of our investments by approximately million
