item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview silver bull  incorporated in nevada  is an exploration stage company  engaged in the business of mineral exploration 
our primary objective is to define sufficient mineral reserves on the sierra mojada property to justify the development of a mechanized mining operation 
we conduct our operations in mexico through our wholly owned mexican subsidiaries  minera and contratistas  and though minera s wholly owned subsidiary minas 
however  as noted above  we have not established any reserves at the sierra mojada property  and are in the exploration stage and may never enter the development or production stage 
on april   we completed a merger transaction with dome whereby dome became our wholly owned subsidiary 
dome through its subsidiaries holds two exploration licenses in gabon  west africa covering approximately  square kilometers and entered into a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of anglogold on its ndjole license and previously held mevang license 
dome also entered into a second joint venture agreement on the ogooue license held by anglogold 
the ndjole and mevang joint venture agreement and ogooue joint venture agreement were terminated by anglogold effective august  we believe that the ndjole license has gold and manganese potential and the mitzic license has iron ore potential 
we are currently looking for a joint venture partner on the ndjole and mitzic licenses 
operations in gabon are conducted by dome s subsidiaries dome ventures sarl gabon  african resources sarl gabon and gabon resources sarl 
our principal offices are located at west georgia street  suite  vancouver  bc  canada vc l  and our telephone number is current year developments sierra mojada property in january  the board of directors approved a calendar year exploration budget of million for the sierra mojada property and a million budget for general and administration expense 
the majority of budgeted expenditures related to drilling and metallurgy on the silver and zinc mineralization and concession option purchase agreement payments 
due to volatile market conditions as of june  we decided to reduce activity at the sierra mojada property 
our updated exploration budget for the sierra mojada property for the period from june to december was million compared to million in the original budget 
the updated exploration budget focused on metallurgy  compiling geological data to better delineate future drill targets and a  meter underground drill program which was subsequently increased to  meters targeting silver and zinc mineralization defined by significant historical work in the shallow silver zone 
mineralized material estimate on july   srk consulting canada  inc delivered a technical report the report on the silver and zinc mineralization in the shallow silver zone of the sierra mojada property in accordance with the canadian securities administrators national instrument standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 
the resource was estimated from  diamond drill holes  reverse circulation drill holes   channel samples and  long holes 
in total  these contain  assay records  of which  records contain silver and zinc assays values 
at an economic cutoff grade of grams tonne of silver for mineralized material  the report indicates mineralized material of million tonnes at an average silver grade of grams tonne silver and an average zinc percentage of 
mineralized material estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources 
mineralized material as used in this annual report on form k  although permissible under the securities and exchange commission s industry guide  does not indicate reserves by sec standards 
we cannot be certain that any part of the sierra mojada project will ever be confirmed or converted into sec industry guide compliant reserves 
investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted 
drilling approximately  meters of drilling from the surface  targeting the shallow silver zone and  meters of underground drilling  targeting the parrena adit  were completed from january to may from june to october  we drilled from underground  meters targeting the silver mineralization  and  meters  targeting the zinc mineralization 
from november  to december   we drilled  meters targeting the zinc mineralization 
the drilling work completed between june and december was completed using underground termite rigs twinning a series of historical drill holes at the eastern end of the known mineralization of the sierra mojada property 
the twinned holes were up to meters long and were drilled using bq sized diamond core 
twinned holes are drilled beside existing historical drill holes in order to confirm the grade and tenor of the historical data and increase confidence in the historical data set 
 meters  or approximately of a  meter historical data set  was twinned 
the twinning program targeted two main areas of historical drilling  a kilometer zone of silver mineralization at the eastern end of the shallow silver zone and a kilometer zone of zinc mineralization in the zinc zone 
in addition to confirming the grade and tenor of the silver and zinc mineralization with the twinning program  much of the historical longhole data set ended in significant mineralization 
therefore the program also tried to extend the bounds of the known mineralization by drilling longer holes 
due to the limited range of the termite drills  and despite extending some holes by as much as meters  a number of holes from the twinning program still ended in mineralization 
the twinning program was completed in december metallurgical studies our vice president of metallurgy  george rawsthorne  in conjunction with outside metallurgical consultants  is leading our metallurgical program 
the goal of this program is to test the silver mineralization for heap and agitation cyanide leach methods 
we will also investigate how any low grade zinc which reports with the silver mineralization  can be recovered 
we will also review all of the previous metallurgical work completed on the zinc zone 
during november  we received preliminary results for metallurgical testing on samples taken from a portion of the shallow silver zone and the zinc zone 
on the shallow silver zone  metallurgical work focused on cyanide leach recovery of the silver using bottle roll tests to simulate an agitation leach system 
on the zinc zone  metallurgical work focused on roasting the ore in a rotary kiln to fume off the zinc and collect it as a zinc oxide concentrate 
preliminary results from these initial tests were promising  and further metallurgical tests are continuing on samples taken from other areas of the shallow silver zone and zinc zone 
geological mapping in addition to drilling the extensions on the shallow silver zone  a regional mapping and prospecting exploration program focused on the palamos negros and dormidos is underway 
the aim of this program is to identify drill targets in these prospects outside of the shallow silver zone 
exploration program as discussed in the material changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section below we have approved a calendar year exploration budget of million for the sierra mojada property 
the focus of the calendar year exploration program is the completion of an updated ni compliant resource estimate  continued metallurgical work as described previously and the completion of a preliminary economic assessment based on the updated resource estimate 
gabon property the majority of our work in gabon was previously conducted by anglogold under the terms of certain joint venture agreements 
effective august   anglogold terminated those agreements 
we continue to believe that the ndjole license has gold and manganese potential and the mitzic license has iron ore potential 
we are currently looking for a joint venture partner on the ndjole and mitzic licenses 
to date  three main coherent gold anomalies above parts per billion ppb and over km in length and up to km wide and several smaller anomalous zones up to km in length and up to km wide have been identified 
background gold values in the region are less than ppb and results above ppb are considered anomalous 
over of the results received to date are above ppb with peak values in excess of  ppb in the soils 
the anomalies appear to have strong structural controls concentrating along mapped or inferred lithological contacts  structural breaks  and fold hinges 
there is also a strong spatial relationship of the gold anomalies to a thick graphitic lithological unit in the area that is thought to represent an ideal lithological trap for mineralizing fluids 
initial prospecting in these anomalous zones has identified a number of gold bearing quartz veins  many of which run between g t to g t gold 
exploratory drilling has focused on these gold anomalies 
east west trending drill fences have been positioned to test roughly north south trending lithological contacts which are considered as the most favorable sites for gold deposition 
a total of  meters has been drilled with gold intercepts between meter to meters in thickness encountered 
the best intercept averaged g t gold over meters 
most intercepts were in the meter to meters range at to g t gold 
in addition the drilling identified manganese with the best manganese intercept averaging manganese over meters from surface

results of operations for the fiscal year ended october   we experienced a consolidated net loss of  or approximately per share  compared to a consolidated net loss of  or approximately per share during the fiscal year ended october  the  increase in the consolidated net loss was primarily due to a  increase in exploration and property holding costs in the fiscal year from the fiscal year and other income of  in the fiscal year compared to other expenses of  in the fiscal year 
this was partially offset by a  recovery of uncollectible value added taxes in the fiscal year compared to a  provision for uncollectible value added taxes in the fiscal year 
exploration and property holding costs exploration and property holding costs increased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year primarily due to increased drilling costs due to higher drilling costs in the parrena adit  increased assay costs due to rush orders on certain assays and increased metallurgical costs as metallurgical work was a significant focus in the fiscal year 
also  we recorded a  concession impairment in the fiscal year as certain concessions in gabon and mexico will not be pursued and certain concessions which we plan to pursue did not have expected cash flows that supports the value of these assets before the impairment was recorded 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year as described below 
personnel costs decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to  non recurring severance payment in the comparable period last year and lower stock based compensation  which decreased to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
office and administrative expenses increased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
this increase is mainly due to increased investor relation activities 
professional fees decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due a decrease in recruitment fees paid for new employees and a decrease in accounting and tax expenses 
directors fees of  in the fiscal year was similar to  in the fiscal year 
we recorded a recovery of  in the fiscal year for uncollectible value added taxes compared to a provision of  in the fiscal year 
the change in management expectation of collection was mainly due to value added tax collected in mexico of  inclusive of interest related to the tax returns filed in mexico city for calendar year to the allowance for uncollectible taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors including the length of time the returns have been outstanding  responses received form tax authorities  general economic conditions in mexico and gabon and estimated net recovery after commissions 
other income expense we recorded other income of  in the fiscal year compared to other expense of  in the fiscal year 
we recorded interest income of  in the fiscal year compared to  in the fiscal year 
this increase in interest income was mainly as a result of interest received on value added tax collection in mexico 
we recorded a foreign currency transaction loss of  in the fiscal year compared to a foreign currency transaction loss of  in the fiscal year as discussed below 
also  we recorded miscellaneous income of  in the fiscal year compared to miscellaneous expense of  in the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year we received supporting documents that allowed us to reduce our liability for certain withholding taxes 
this amount has been accrued in fiscal year and was included in miscellaneous expense in the fiscal year 
the foreign currency transaction loss in the fiscal year was primarily the result of the depreciation of the central african franc and the resulting impact on the intercompany loans between silver bull and our gabonese subsidiaries 
the foreign currency transaction loss in the fiscal year was primarily the result of the depreciation of the mexican peso and the resulting impact on the intercompany loans between silver bull and our mexican subsidiaries 
in the fiscal year  foreign currency transaction gains losses are not recorded on the intercompany loans between silver bull and our mexican subsidiaries due to the change in functional currency described in the critical accounting policies section 
material changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows during the fiscal year we primarily utilized cash and cash on hand to fund exploration activities at the sierra mojada property including property  property concession option purchase agreement payments and general and administrative expenses 
additionally  during fiscal year  we received net proceeds after offering costs of  as we closed registered direct offerings for the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share during december as a result of the registered direct offerings offset by the exploration activities and general and administrative expenses  cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at october  to  at october  cash flows used in operations for the fiscal year was  as compared to  in the fiscal year 
this decrease was mainly due to the collection of vat receivable in fiscal year which was partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash flows used in investing activity for the fiscal year was  as compared to  in the fiscal year 
the increase was mainly due to property concession option payments of  in the fiscal year compared to  in the fiscal year which was offset by proceeds from equipment sales of  in the last fiscal year 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year was  as compared to  for the fiscal year 
the significant increase is due to the registered direct offerings which closed in december for net proceeds of  compared to net proceeds of  for the private placement with coeur d alene mines corporation and proceeds from exercise of warrants and options of  in the fiscal year 
capital resources as of october   we had cash and cash on hand of  and working capital of  as compared to cash and cash on hand of  and working capital of  as of october  the decrease in our cash and cash on hand was primarily the result of cash used by operating and investing activities which was partially offset by the registered direct offerings in december the increase in our working capital was mainly due the expectation that value added taxes will be collected within twelve months of the balance sheet date and the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was partially offset by the decrease in cash and cash on hand 
since inception  we have relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and registered direct offerings of our equity securities and warrant exercises as our primary sources of financing to fund our operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on sales of our securities in order to continue to fund our business operations 
issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional sales of our equity securities or that we will be able arrange for other financing to fund our planned business activities 
if we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing  including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  we will need to significantly reduce operations  which will result in an adverse impact on our business  financial conditions and exploration activities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
capital requirements and liquidity  need for subsequent funding our management and board of directors monitor our overall costs  expenses  and financial resources and  if necessary  will adjust our planned operational expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have sufficient operating capital 
we continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures including for our sierra mojada property as discussed below 
the continued exploration of the sierra mojada property will require significant amounts of additional capital 
in january  the board of directors approved a calendar year exploration budget of million for the sierra mojada property and a million budget for general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash on hand  and therefore we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fully fund the calendar year exploration program at the sierra mojada property and for general and administrative expenses 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to raise additional capital  and we will reduce expenditures on the sierra mojada property if we determine that additional capital is unavailable or available on terms that we determine are unacceptable 
also  the continued exploration of the sierra mojada property ultimately will require us to raise additional capital  identify other sources of funding or identify another strategic transaction 
the on going uncertainty and volatility in the global financial and capital markets have limited the availability of funding 
debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
equity financing  if available  may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing  including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted 
table of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands of operating leases sierra mojada concession option purchase payments ndjole and mitzic required concession expenditures total the above table assumes the poder de dios  anexas a poder de dios and amplicaion a poder de dios option purchase price is exercised on january   the la perla  la india and la india dos option purchase price is exercised on january  and the nuevo dulces nombres  yolanda iii option purchase is exercised on august  also  the above table assumes that the gabon government amends the ndjole and mitzic concessions licenses to reflect the required exploration expenditures of cfa  per concession to renew the concessions for a third term of three years per gabonese law 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements adopted in the year ended october  in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
which included additional disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements disclosures effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in september  fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other 
this new guidance on testing goodwill provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with prospective application required 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
this update amended the presentation options in accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income  to provide an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with retrospective application required 
the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position  result of operations or cash flow 
in may  fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this update amended explanations of how to measure fair value to result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reposting standards 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with prospective application required 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by fasb including its emerging issues task force and the sec did not or are not believed to have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an on going basis and discuss the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
we believe these consolidated financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates 
our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances 
revisions to estimates and assumptions are accounted for prospectively 
significant areas involving the use of estimates include determining the allowance for uncollectible taxes  evaluating recoverability of property concessions  evaluating impairment of long lived assets  evaluating impairment of goodwill  establishing a valuation allowance on future use of deferred tax assets and calculating stock based compensation 
property concessions costs of acquiring property concessions are capitalized by project area upon purchase or staking of the associated claims 
costs to maintain the mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred 
when a property reaches the production stage  the related capitalized costs will be amortized  using the units of production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves 
to date  no mineral concessions have reached the production stage 
impairment of long lived assets management reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if the future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the difference between book value and fair value of the asset group  as determined through the application of a present value technique using expected future cash flows to estimate fair value in the absence of a market price 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
in estimating future cash flows  all assets are grouped at the exploration project level 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
when multiple reporting units are acquired in one business combination  goodwill is allocated to reporting units as of the date of the business combination  by determining estimates of the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing this amount to the fair values of assets and liabilities in the reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform goodwill annual impairment tests at april each fiscal year and when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may no longer be recoverable 
goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level 
in performing the impairment tests  we estimate the fair values of our reporting units that include goodwill and compare those fair values to the reporting units carrying amounts 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount  and any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value is charged to earnings 
income taxes we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of the assets and liabilities measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
this accounting standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe we have met the more likely than not standard imposed by this guidance to allow recognition of such an asset 
management recorded a full valuation allowance at october  and october  against the deferred tax assets as it deems future realization would not meet the criteria more likely than not 
stock based compensation and warrants we use the black scholes pricing model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock options awarded to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
the expected term of the options is based upon evaluation of historical and expected future exercise behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life of the grant 
volatility is determined upon historical volatility of our stock and adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the dividend yield is assumed to be none as we have not paid dividends nor do we anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we use the graded vesting attribution method to recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period 
we also used the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair market value of warrants 
expected volatility is based upon weighted average of historical volatility over the contractual term of the warrant and implied volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based upon implied yield on a us treasury zero coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the contractual term of the warrants 
the dividend yield is assumed to be none as the company has not paid dividends nor does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency translation during the year ended october  assets and liabilities of our foreign operations were translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rate  and revenue and expenses were translated at the average exchange rate during the period 
exchange differences arising on translation were disclosed as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions were reflected in the results of operations 
intercompany transactions and balances with our mexican and gabonese subsidiaries were considered to be short term in nature except for million of intercompany loans which we agreed to convert to future capital increases 
all foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans which were not considered to be short term in nature were included in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the year ended october  our gabonese foreign operations were translated into us dollars consistent with the year ended october  as at november   we determined that the functional currency of our mexican subsidiaries changed from the mexican peso to the us dollar 
during the year ended october  our mexican foreign operations monetary assets and liabilities were translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rate and non monetary assets and liabilities were translated using the historical exchange rate 
our mexican foreign operations revenue and expenses were translated at the average exchange rate during the period except for depreciation of office and mining equipment and impairment of property concessions which are translated using the historical exchange rate 
foreign currency translation gains and losses of our foreign mexican operations occurring after november  are included in the consolidated statement of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we hold substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions 
the interest rates received on these balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
based on the average cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances during the year ended october   a decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction in interest income for the period of  foreign currency exchange risk certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in canadian dollars cdn  mexican pesos mxn  central african francs cfa or other currencies 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations 
specifically  the appreciation of the mxn  cdn or cfa against the us dollar may result in an increase in operating expenses and capital costs in us dollar terms 
as of october   we maintained the majority of our cash balance in us dollars 
we currently do not engage in any currency hedging activities 
commodity price risk our primary business activity is the exploration of properties containing silver  zinc  lead  gold  manganese and other minerals 
as a result  decreases in the price of any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our ability to establish reserves and develop our exploration properties 
none of our properties are in production and we do not currently hold any commodity derivative positions
