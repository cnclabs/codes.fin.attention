regional money transfer providers regional money transfer providers  or niche providers  provide the same services as global money transfer providers  but focus on a smaller group of corridors or services within one region  such as north america to the caribbean  central or south america  or western europe to north africa 
banks and postbanks banks and postbanks of all sizes compete with us in a number of ways  including bank wire services and card based services 
informal networks informal networks enable people to transfer funds without formal mechanisms and often without compliance with government reporting requirements 
we believe that such networks comprise a significant share of the market 
electronic commerce online money transfer services allow consumers to send and receive money electronically using the internet or mobile phones 
alternative channels alternative channels for sending and receiving money include mail and commercial courier services  and card based options  such as atm cards and stored value cards 
we believe the most significant competitive factors in consumer to consumer remittances relate to the overall consumer value proposition  including brand recognition  trust and reliability  distribution network and channel options  and consumer experience and price

table of contents competition western union competes with a diverse set of service providers offering both cash and electronic based payment solutions 
competition in electronic payment services includes financial institutions which may offer consumer bill payment in their own name or may host payment services operated under the names of their clients and other non bank competitors

in many cases  competitors specialize in a small number of industries 
competitors for cash payments include businesses that allow consumers to pay a bill at one of their locations  or at the location of a partner business  as well as mail and courier services 
the ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments in the united states and competitive pressures  which result in lower cash based bill payment volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products  continue to impact this business

table of contents risk management our company has a credit risk management department that evaluates and monitors our agent related credit and fraud risks 
we are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer  walk in bill payment and money order settlement process 
we also are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our online services and electronic consumer to business payment channels  where transactions are originated through means other than cash  and may therefore be subject to chargebacks  insufficient funds  or other collection impediments  such as fraud 
our credit risk management team performs a credit review before each agent signing and conducts periodic analyses 
we are exposed to credit risk in our business solutions business relating to a derivatives written by us to our customers and b receivables from certain customers for which beneficiaries are paid prior to receiving cleared funds from the customer  where we have offered trade credit 
for the derivatives  the duration of these contracts at inception is generally less than one year 
the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers  possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 
for those receivables where we have offered trade credit  collection ordinarily occurs within a few days 
to mitigate risk  we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis  and  for our derivatives  we may require certain customers to post collateral or increase collateral based on the fair value of the customer contract and their risk profile 
to manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities  money market fund investments and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions  we regularly review investment concentrations  trading levels  credit spreads and credit ratings  and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions 
a key component of the western union business model is our ability to manage financial risk associated with conducting transactions worldwide 
we settle accounts with the majority of our agents in united states dollars or euros 
we utilize foreign currency exchange contracts  primarily forward contracts  to mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations and to provide predictability of future cash flows 
limited foreign currency risk arises with respect to the agent settlement process because the majority of money transfer transactions are paid within hours after they are initiated and agent settlements occur within a few days in most instances 
we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management due to the nature of our business solutions business 
the majority of this business revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments 
business solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts  including the derivative contracts described above  and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 
the foreign exchange risk is actively managed 
our financial results may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates 
we review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each  while also considering the duration of the individual positions 
we manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk  reduce costs and improve returns 
our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest bearing assets  as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt 
the latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the terms of any new debt issuances ie  fixed versus floating 
we use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt  subject to market conditions 

table of contents international investment no provision has been made for united states federal and state income taxes on certain of our outside tax basis differences  which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately billion as of december   as we expect to reinvest these earnings outside the united states indefinitely 
we intend to invest these earnings to expand and diversify our global distribution and explore new service offerings and may also consider international acquisition opportunities 
in  our foreign cash allowed us to acquire tgbp and the remaining interests in two of our largest european based agents  finint srl and angelo costa  srl however  if we are unable to utilize accumulated earnings outside of the united states and we repatriate these earnings to the united states in the form of actual or constructive dividends  we would be subject to united states federal income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits  state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
such taxes could be significant 
regulation our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by the united states federal government  each of the states  many localities and many other countries and jurisdictions  including the european union

our services also are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering  terrorist financing  fraud  and other illicit activity 
failure  by western union  our agents  or their subagents agents and subagents are third parties  over whom western union has limited legal and practical control  to comply with any of these requirements or their interpretation could result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to provide money transfer services and or payment services or foreign exchange products  the limitation  suspension or termination of services  the seizure of our assets  and or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  including fines and restrictions on our ability to offer services 
we have developed and continue to enhance our global compliance programs  including our anti money laundering program comprised of policies  procedures  systems and internal controls to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  we continue to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current and evolving legal standards and industry practices  including heightened regulatory focus on compliance with anti money laundering or fraud prevention requirements 
these programs include dedicated compliance personnel  training and monitoring programs  suspicious activity reporting  regulatory outreach and education  and support and guidance to our agent network on regulatory compliance 
our money transfer and payment service networks operate through third party agents in most countries  and  therefore  there are limitations on our legal and practical ability to completely control those agents compliance activities 
in  the company spent over million on its compliance and regulatory programs 
money transfer and payment instrument licensing and regulation our money transfer and money order services are subject to anti money laundering laws and regulations  including the bank secrecy act  as amended  including by the usa patriot act of collectively  the bsa and similar state laws and regulations 
the bsa  among other things  requires money transfer companies and the issuers and sellers of money orders  to develop and implement risk based anti money laundering programs  report large cash transactions and suspicious activity  and in some cases  to collect and maintain information about consumers who use their services and maintain other transaction records 
many states impose similar and  in some cases  more stringent requirements 
these requirements also apply to our agents 
in addition  the united states department of the treasury has interpreted the bsa to require money transfer companies to conduct due diligence into and risk based monitoring of their agents inside and outside the united states 
compliance with anti money laundering laws and regulations has become a top area of regulatory attention  with agreements being reached with western union and several large financial institutions  including another money transfer provider 
economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the united states department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain countries  their governments  and in certain circumstances  their nationals  as well as with specifically designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers  terrorists and terrorist organizations 
we provide very limited money transfer and payments services to individuals in cuba  syria and sudan pursuant to and as authorized by advisory opinions of  or licenses granted by  ofac 

table of contents in the united states  most states license money transfer services providers and many exercise authority over the operations of our money transfer services and  as part of this authority  regularly examine us 
many states require us to invest the proceeds of money transfers in highly rated  investment grade securities  and our use of such investments is restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations 
we regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly rated securities in compliance with these regulations 
the majority of our investment securities  classified within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets  are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the united states and had credit ratings of aa or better from a major credit rating agency as of december  these licensing laws also cover matters such as government approval of controlling shareholders and senior management of our licensed entities  regulatory approval of agents and in some instances their locations  consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee  and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain certain net worth levels 
many states also require money transmitters and their agents to comply with federal and or state anti money laundering laws and regulations 
outside of the united states  our money transfer business is subject to some form of regulation in all of the countries and territories in which we offer those services 
these laws and regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services  agent registration requirements  limitations on the amount of principal that can be sent into or out of a country  limitations on the number of money transfers that may be sent or received by a consumer and controls on the rates of exchange between currencies 
they also include laws and regulations intended to detect and prevent money laundering or terrorist financing  including obligations to collect and maintain information about consumers  recordkeeping  reporting and due diligence  and supervision of agents and sub agents similar to and in some cases exceeding those required under the bsa 
in most countries  either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer services 
the payment services directive psd in the european union eu  along with similar laws in other jurisdictions  have imposed new rules on payment service providers like western union 
in particular  western union has become responsible for the regulatory compliance of our agents who are engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries 
thus  the costs to monitor our agents and the risk of adverse regulatory action against us because of the actions of our agents in those areas have increased 
the majority of our eu business is managed through our psd subsidiary  which is regulated by the central bank of ireland 
under the psd  we are subject to investment safeguarding rules and periodic examinations similar to those we are subject to in the united states 
these rules have resulted in increased compliance costs and may lead to increased competition in our areas of service 
additional countries may adopt legislation similar to these laws 
the psd  as well as legislation in other countries such as russia  has also allowed an increased number of non bank entities to become money transfer agents  thereby resulting in increased competition

including the costs required pursuant to the agreement and settlement  the company has spent over million since on its compliance programs along the united states and mexico border 
we are considering entering into an extension of the term of the agreement and settlement or another arrangement with the state of arizona  either of which would require the approval of the state of arizona and could have further adverse effects on our business  including additional costs 
the monitor has made a number of recommendations regarding our compliance programs 
while the company has devoted significant time and resources to these efforts  it is expected that not every recommendation of the monitor will be fully implemented within the required timeframe ending on july  if the company is not able to negotiate an extension of the agreement and settlement or other arrangement and the state of arizona determines that the company has committed a willful and material breach  the state of arizona has indicated that it will pursue remedies under the agreement and settlement  which could include initiating civil or criminal actions

the cfpb will create additional regulatory oversight for us 
regulations issued by the cfpb  which we anticipate may become effective in mid  will impact our business in a variety of areas 
these include a requirement to provide consumers sending funds internationally from the united states enhanced pre transaction disclosures  including the disclosure of third party fees and taxes  an obligation to resolve various errors  including certain errors that may be outside our control  and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a consumer request 
we have modified certain of our systems  business practices  service offerings or procedures to comply with these regulations 
we will face liability for the failure of our money transfer agents to comply with the rules and are implementing additional policies  procedures  and oversight measures designed to assure compliance by our agents 
the extent of these policies  procedures  and measures may be considered by the cfpb in any action or proceeding against us for noncompliance with the rules by our agents 
also  our business solutions business in the united states will be subjected to increased regulatory oversight and reporting requirements relating to the foreign exchange derivative products offered to certain of its customers 
in addition  our implementation of these requirements could impact our business relationships with banking and other financial institution partners who offer our business solutions services 
we may also be subject to examination by the cfpb 
in addition  rules adopted under the dodd frank act by other governmental agencies will likely subject certain of our future corporate interest rate and foreign exchange hedging transactions to centralized clearing  margin  and other requirements

table of contents privacy and information security regulations the collection  transfer  disclosure  use and storage of personal information are required to provide our services 
these activities are subject to information security standards  data privacy  data breach and related laws and regulations in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  data privacy and data breach laws such as the federal gramm leach bliley act and various state laws apply directly to a broad range of financial institutions including money transmitters like western union  and indirectly to companies that provide services to or on behalf of those institutions 
the united states federal trade commission ftc has an on going program of investigating the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many  resulting in multimillion dollar settlements and multi year agreements governing the settling companies privacy practices 
the ftc and several states have expanded their area of concern to include privacy practices related to mobile applications 
many state laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals  state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach of computer databases or physical documents that contain certain types of non public personal information and present a risk for unauthorized use 
the collection  transfer  disclosure  use and storage of personal information required to provide our services is subject to data privacy laws outside of the united states  such as laws adopted pursuant to the eu ec directive of the european parliament the data protection directive  and individual national and provincial laws throughout the world 
in some cases  these laws are more restrictive than the gramm leach bliley act and impose additional duties on companies 
these laws  which are not uniform  do one or more of the following restrict the collection  transfer  processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal information  require notice to individuals of privacy practices and may give individuals certain rights to prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing 
these regulations  laws and industry standards also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of internal data security standards  controls or guidelines 
in connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations  western union makes information available to certain united states federal and state  as well as certain foreign  government agencies when required by law 
in recent years  these agencies have increased their requests for such information from western union and other companies both financial service providers and others  particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or identity theft 
during the same period  there has also been increased public attention regarding the corporate use and disclosure of personal information  accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection  information security and consumer privacy 
these regulatory goals the prevention of money laundering  terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the individual right to privacy may conflict  and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled 
while we believe that western union is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities  the legal  political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing  and subsequent legislation  regulation  litigation  court rulings or other events could expose western union to increased program costs  liability and reputational damage 
banking regulation we have subsidiaries that operate under banking licenses granted by the austrian financial market authority and the brazilian central bank which subject these subsidiaries to austrian and brazilian regulations

table of contents item a 
risk factors there are many factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  some of which are beyond our control 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the risks described below 
such risks are grouped according to risks relating to our business and industry  risks related to our regulatory and litigation environment  and risks related to the spin off 
you should carefully consider all of these risks 
risks relating to our business and industry if consumers confidence in our business or in traditional money transfer and payment service providers generally deteriorates  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business is built on consumers confidence in our brands and our ability to provide fast  reliable money transfer and payment services 
erosion in consumers confidence in our business  or in traditional money transfer and payment service providers as a means to transfer money  could adversely impact transaction volumes which would in turn adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of factors could adversely affect consumers confidence in our business  or in traditional money transfer and payment service providers generally  many of which are beyond our control  and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
these factors include changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or regulator or judicial interpretation thereof that have the effect of making it more difficult or less desirable for consumers to transfer money using traditional money transfer and payment service providers  including additional customer due diligence  identification  reporting  and recordkeeping requirements  failure of our agents or their subagents to deliver services in accordance with our requirements  reputational concerns resulting from actual or perceived events  including those related to fraud  actions by federal  state or foreign regulators that interfere with our ability to transfer consumers money reliably  for example  attempts to seize money transfer funds  or limit our ability to or prohibit us from transferring money in certain corridors  federal  state or foreign legal requirements  including those that require us to provide consumer data to a greater extent than is currently required  any significant interruption in our systems  including by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorism  vendor failure  unauthorized entry and computer viruses or disruptions in our workforce  and any breach of our security policies or legal requirements resulting in a compromise of consumer privacy or data use and security 
many of our money transfer consumers are migrants 
consumer advocacy groups or governmental agencies could consider migrants to be disadvantaged and entitled to protection  enhanced consumer disclosure  or other different treatment 
if consumer advocacy groups are able to generate widespread support for positions that are detrimental to our business  then our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents difficult conditions in global financial markets  global economic downturns and financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the global capital and credit markets have experienced in recent years  and in the future may experience  unprecedented volatility and disruption and we face certain risks relating to such events  including demand for our services could soften compared to historical growth rates  including due to low consumer confidence  high unemployment  or reduced global trade 
our agents or clients could experience reduced sales or business as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions 
as a result  our agents could reduce their numbers of locations or hours of operation  or cease doing business altogether 
businesses using our services may make fewer cross currency payments or may have fewer customers making payments to them through us  particularly businesses in those industries that may be more affected by an economic downturn 
our exposure to receivables from our agents  consumers and businesses could impact us 
for more information on this risk  see risk factor  we face credit  liquidity and fraud risks from our agents  consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market value of the securities in our investment portfolio may substantially decline 
the impact of that decline in value may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the counterparties to the derivative financial instruments that we use to reduce our exposure to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  may fail to honor their obligations  which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate 
that failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures in our business solutions business  including the exposure generated by the derivative contracts we write to our customers as part of our cross currency payments business  and typically hedge the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 
if our customers fail to honor their obligations or if the counterparties to our offsetting positions fail to honor their obligations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness as it becomes due or we may have to refinance on unfavorable terms  which could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases  dividends  and other purposes 
our revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks is one source for funding liquidity needs and also backs our commercial paper program 
if any of the banks participating in our credit facility fails to fulfill its lending commitment to us  our short term liquidity and ability to support borrowings under our commercial paper program could be adversely affected 
the third party service providers on whom we depend may experience difficulties in their businesses  which may impair their ability to provide services to us and have a potential impact on our own business 
the impact of a change or temporary stoppage of services may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
banks upon which we rely to conduct our business could fail or be unable to satisfy their obligations to us 
this could lead to our inability to access funds and or credit losses for us and could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 
if market disruption and volatility occurs  we could experience difficulty in accessing capital and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
while the global financial and capital markets have stabilized  recent concerns regarding us debt and budget matters and the sovereign debt crisis in europe have caused increased uncertainty in financial markets 
a failure to raise the us debt limit and or a further downgrade of us debt ratings in the future could result in credit and financial market disruptions  adversely affect our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms and adversely affect our business and our financial results and condition 
the impact of the sovereign debt crisis in europe on financial institutions in europe and globally could also have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally and on our business and financial results and condition 

table of contents we face competition from global and niche or corridor money transfer providers  united states and international banks  card associations  card based payments providers and a number of other types of service providers  including electronic and internet providers 
our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in the industry 
money transfer and global business payments are highly competitive industries which include service providers from a variety of financial and non financial business groups 
our competitors include banks  credit unions  automated teller machine providers and operators  card associations  card based payments providers such as issuers of e money  travel cards or stored value cards  informal remittance systems  web based services  phone payment systems including mobile phone networks  postal organizations  retailers  check cashers  mail and courier services  currency exchanges and traditional money transfer companies 
these services are differentiated by features and functionalities such as brand recognition  customer service  trust and reliability  distribution network and channel options  convenience  price  speed  variety of payment methods  service offerings  and innovation 
our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in these industries 
for example  if we fail to price our services appropriately  consumers may not use our services  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
in our consumer to consumer transaction volume in certain key corridors was adversely affected by increasing pricing differentials between our money transfer services and those of some of our competitors  which adversely affected our financial results 
in addition  failure to compete on service differentiation could significantly affect our future growth potential and results of operations 
as noted below  many of our agents outside the united states are national post offices 
these entities are usually governmental organizations that may enjoy special privileges or protections that could allow them to simultaneously develop their own money transfer businesses 
international postal organizations could agree to establish a money transfer network among themselves 
due to the size of these organizations and the number of locations they have  any such network could represent significant competition to us 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of pricing reductions  which could adversely affect our business 
we have made periodic pricing reductions from time to time in response to competition and to implement our brand investment strategy  which includes better meeting consumer needs  maximizing market opportunities and strengthening our overall competitive positioning 
for example  in the fourth quarter of we implemented pricing reductions in certain key corridors  and we announced that we anticipated continuing these reductions and making additional pricing reductions in we have made additional pricing reductions in the first quarter of  and we anticipate continuing these reductions and making additional reductions in pricing reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes which may lead to increased revenues and operating income in these certain corridors thereafter 
however  the anticipated benefits of these pricing reductions may not be realized within a certain time period or at all 
if we fail to realize the anticipated benefit of the pricing reductions  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
our ability to respond to new and enhanced products and changing industry standards and evolving customer needs or trends poses a challenge to our business 
our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes  with the constant introduction of new and enhanced products and services and evolving industry standards and consumer needs and preferences 
our ability to enhance our current products and services and introduce new products and services that address these changes has a significant impact on our ability to be successful 
we actively seek to respond in a timely manner to changes in customer both consumer and business needs and preferences  technology advances and new and enhanced products such as technology based money transfer and business solutions payments services  including internet  phone based and other mobile money transfer services and prepaid  stored value and other card based money transfer services 
there can be no guarantee  however  that we will be successful in responding to these challenges 
failure to respond well to these challenges on a timely basis could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  even if we respond well to these challenges  the business and financial models offered by many of these alternative  more technology reliant means of money transfer and electronic payment solutions may be less advantageous to us than the model offered by our traditional cash agent model 

table of contents risks associated with operations outside the united states and foreign currencies could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with changes in the value of our revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
our business solutions business provides currency conversion and  in certain countries  foreign exchange hedging services to its customers  further exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk 
in order to mitigate these risks  we enter into derivative contracts 
however  these contracts do not eliminate all of the risks related to fluctuating foreign currency rates 
these risks have increased in recent years as concerns rise regarding the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations  the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 
these concerns may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate more widely than in the past and could lead to the re introduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries  or  in more extreme circumstances  the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely 
if there is a significant devaluation of the euro and we are unable to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro  the value of our euro denominated net monetary assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements 
similarly  the re introduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated net monetary assets and liabilities 
our foreign exchange risk is greater  and our foreign exchange risk management is heightened  in our business solutions business 
the significant majority of business solutions revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments 
in certain countries  this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers 
the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year 
the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers  possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 
business solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts  including the derivative contracts described above  and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 
if we are unable to obtain offsetting positions  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states and much of the cash and cash equivalents from this business are held by our foreign entities 
repatriating these funds to the united states would  in many cases  result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at foreign tax rates that are relatively low compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
if repatriation of these funds is required or if a change in legislation requires a different tax treatment  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
for further discussion regarding the risk that our future effective tax rates could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws  both domestically and internationally  see risk factor changes in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense below 
money transfers and payments to  from  within  or between countries may be limited or prohibited by law 
at times in the past  we have been required to cease operations in particular countries due to political uncertainties or government restrictions imposed by foreign governments or the united states 
occasionally agents have been required by their regulators to cease offering our services  see risk factor regulatory initiatives and changes in laws  regulations and industry practices and standards affecting us  our agents or their subagents could require changes in our business model and increase our costs of operations  which could adversely affect our operations  results of operations and financial condition below 
additionally  economic or political instability or natural disasters may make money transfers to  from  within  or between particular countries difficult or impossible  such as when banks are closed  when currency devaluation makes exchange rates difficult to manage or when natural disasters or civil unrest makes access to agent locations unsafe 
these risks could negatively impact our ability to offer our services  to make payments to or receive payments from international agents or our subsidiaries or our ability to recoup funds that have been advanced to international agents or are held by our subsidiaries and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the general state of telecommunications and infrastructure in some lesser developed countries  including countries where we have a large number of transactions  creates operational risks for us and our agents that generally are not present in our operations in the united states and other more developed countries 

table of contents many of our agents outside the united states are post offices  which are usually owned and operated by national governments 
these governments may decide to change the terms under which they allow post offices to offer remittances and other financial services 
for example  governments may decide to separate financial service operations from postal operations  or mandate the creation or privatization of a post bank or they may require multiple service providers in their network 
a government could decide to restrict remittance service to only the national post office 
these changes could have an adverse effect on our ability to distribute  offer or price our services in countries that are material to our business 
interruptions in migration patterns  including as a result of economic conditions  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our consumer to consumer money transfer business relies in large part on migration  which brings workers to countries with greater economic opportunities than those available in their native countries 
a significant portion of money transfers are sent by international migrants 
migration is affected by among other factors overall economic conditions  the availability of job opportunities  changes in immigration laws  and political or other events such as war  terrorism or health emergencies that would make it more difficult for workers to migrate or work abroad 
changes to these factors could adversely affect our remittance volume and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our consumers work in industries that may be impacted by deteriorating economic conditions more quickly or significantly than other industries 
reduced job opportunities  especially in construction  manufacturing  hospitality  agriculture and retail  or overall weakness in the world economies could adversely affect the number of money transfer transactions  the principal amounts transferred and correspondingly our results of operations 
if general market softness in the economies of countries important to migrant workers occurs  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
additionally  if our consumer transactions decline  if the amount of money that consumers send per transaction declines  or if migration patterns shift due to weak or deteriorating economic conditions  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
acquisitions and integration of new businesses create risks and may affect operating results 
we have acquired and may acquire businesses both inside and outside the united states 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks 
the core risks involve valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence and integration managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company people  products and services  technology and other assets in an effort to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the projected synergies of the acquisition 
in addition  the need in some cases to improve regulatory compliance standards is another risk associated with acquiring companies  see risks related to our regulatory and litigation environment below 
acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including  for example managing geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  managing multi jurisdictional operating  tax and financing structures  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  integrating the acquired technologies into our company  realization of anticipated financial benefits from these acquisitions and where necessary  improving internal controls of these acquired businesses  complying with regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
table of contents enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  difficulty entering new markets with the services of the acquired businesses  and general economic and political conditions  including legal and other barriers to cross border investment in general  or by united states companies in particular 
integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or divert resources from  one or more of our businesses and could result in the loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with an acquisition and the integration of the acquired company operations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had  million of goodwill comprising approximately of our total assets  including  million of goodwill in our consumer to consumer reporting unit and million of goodwill in our business solutions reporting unit 
tgbp represents a significant majority of the goodwill related to the business solutions reporting unit 
for the business solutions reporting unit  a decline in estimated fair value of approximately could occur before triggering an impairment of goodwill 
if we or our reporting units do not generate operating cash flows at levels consistent with our expectations  we may be required to write down the goodwill on our balance sheet  which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
see the critical accounting policies and estimates discussion in part ii  item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  for more detail 
we face credit  liquidity and fraud risks from our agents  consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the vast majority of our global funds transfer business is conducted through third party agents that provide our services to consumers at their retail locations 
these agents sell our services  collect funds from consumers and are required to pay the proceeds from these transactions to us 
as a result  we have credit exposure to our agents 
in some countries  our agent networks include superagents that establish subagent relationships  these agents must collect funds from their subagents in order to pay us 
we are not insured against credit losses  except in certain circumstances related to agent theft or fraud 
if an agent becomes insolvent  files for bankruptcy  commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay money order  money transfer or payment services proceeds to us  we must nonetheless pay the money order  complete the money transfer or payment services on behalf of the consumer 
the liquidity of our agents is necessary for our business to remain strong and to continue to provide our services 
if our agents fail to settle with us in a timely manner  our liquidity could be affected 
from time to time  we have made  and may in the future make  short term advances and longer term loans to our agents 
these advances and loans generally are secured by settlement funds payable by us to these agents 
however  the failure of these borrowing agents to repay these advances and loans constitutes a credit risk to us 
in our business solutions business  we are also exposed to credit risk relating to foreign currency forward and option contracts written by us to our customers 
the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year 
the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers  possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 
if a customer becomes insolvent  files for bankruptcy  commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us for the value of these contracts  we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty 

table of contents we offer consumers  primarily in the united states  the ability to transfer money utilizing their credit or debit card via the internet and phone 
because these are not face to face transactions  these transactions involve a greater risk of fraud 
we apply verification and other tools to help authenticate transactions and protect against fraud 
however  these tools are not always successful in protecting us against fraud 
as the merchant of these transactions  we may bear the financial risk of the full amount sent in some of the fraudulent transactions 
issuers of credit and debit cards may also incur losses due to fraudulent transactions through our distribution channels and may elect to block transactions by their cardholders in these channels with or without notice 
we may be subject to additional fees or penalties if the amount of chargebacks exceeds a certain percentage of our transaction volume 
such fees and penalties escalate over time if we do not take effective action to reduce chargebacks below the threshold  and if chargeback levels are not ultimately reduced to acceptable levels  our merchant accounts could be suspended or revoked  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we collect  transfer and retain consumer  business  employee and agent data as part of our business 
these activities are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions  see risk factor current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs of operations  which could adversely affect our operations  results of operations and financial condition below 
the requirements imposed by these laws and regulations  which often differ materially among the many jurisdictions  are designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately used or disclosed 
we have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements 
however  despite those safeguards  it is possible that hackers  employees acting contrary to our policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose data about our consumers  business customers  agents and or employees 
further  because some data is collected and stored by third parties  it is possible that a third party could intentionally or negligently disclose personal data in violation of law 
also  in some jurisdictions we transfer data related to our employees  business customers  consumers  agents and potential employees to third party vendors in order to perform due diligence and for other reasons 
it is possible that a vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose such data 
any breach of our security policies or applicable legal requirements resulting in a compromise of consumer  business  employee or agent data could require us to notify impacted individuals  and in some cases regulators  of a possible or actual breach  expose us to regulatory enforcement action  including fines  limit our ability to provide services  subject us to litigation and or damage our reputation 
interruptions in our systems or disruptions in our workforce may have a significant effect on our business 
our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer information systems and those of our service providers 
any significant interruptions could harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of consumers 
these systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorism  vendor failure  unauthorized entry and computer viruses or other causes  many of which may be beyond our control or that of our service providers 
further  from time to time  we have been the subject of cyber attacks 
these attacks are primarily aimed at interrupting our business or exploiting information security vulnerabilities 
historically  none of these attacks or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in any material liability to us or any material damage to our reputation 
furthermore  disruptions related to cybersecurity have not caused any material disruption to the company business  although there can be no assurance that a material breach will not occur in the future 
although we have taken steps to prevent systems disruptions  our measures may not be successful and we may experience problems other than system disruptions 
we also may experience software defects  development delays  installation difficulties and other systems problems  which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability which may not be fully covered by our business interruption insurance 
our data applications may not be sufficient to address technological advances  regulatory requirements  changing market conditions or other developments 
in addition  any work stoppages or other labor actions by employees  the significant majority of which are located outside the united states  could adversely affect our business 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain our agent  subagent or global business payments networks under terms consistent with those currently in place  or if our agents or their subagents fail to comply with western union business and technology standards and contract requirements  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
most of our consumer to consumer revenue is derived through our agent network 
in addition  our international agents may have subagent relationships in which we are not directly involved 
transaction volumes at existing agent and subagent locations often increase over time and new agents and their subagents provide us with additional revenue 
if  due to competition or other reasons  agents or their subagents decide to leave our network  or if we are unable to sign new agents or maintain our agent network under terms consistent with those currently in place  or if our agents are unable to maintain relationships with or sign new subagents  our revenue and profits may be adversely affected 
agent attrition might occur for a number of reasons  including a competitor engaging an agent  an agent dissatisfaction with its relationship with us or the revenue derived from that relationship  or an agent or its subagents unwillingness or inability to comply with our standards or legal requirements  including those related to compliance with anti money laundering regulations  anti fraud measures  or agent registration and monitoring requirements 
for example  changes to our compliance related practices as a result of our agreement and settlement with the state of arizona and changes to our business model  primarily related to our vigo and orlandi valuta brands  have resulted in the loss of over  agent locations in mexico 
in addition  agents may generate fewer transactions or less revenue for various reasons  including increased competition  political unrest or changes in the economy 
because an agent is a third party that engages in a variety of activities in addition to providing our services  it may encounter business difficulties unrelated to its provision of our services  which could cause the agent to reduce its number of locations  hours of operation  or cease doing business altogether 
we rely on our agents information systems and or processes to obtain transaction data 
if an agent or their subagent loses information  if there is a significant disruption to the information systems of an agent or their subagent  or if an agent or their subagent does not maintain the appropriate controls over their systems  we may experience reputational harm which could result in losses to the company 
we have relationships with more than  consumer payments businesses to which our customers can make payments 
these relationships are a core component of our global payments services  and we derive a substantial portion of our consumer to business revenue through these relationships 
if we are unable to sign new relationships or maintain our current relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place  our revenue and profit growth rates may be adversely affected 
for example  changes in laws regulating competition or in the interpretation of those laws could undermine our ability to enter into or maintain our exclusive arrangements with our current and prospective agents  especially in certain inbound countries 
see risk factor regulatory initiatives and changes in laws  regulations and industry practices and standards affecting us  our agents or their subagents could require changes in our business model and increase our costs of operations  which could adversely affect our operations  results of operations and financial condition below 
in addition  certain of our agents and subagents have refused to enter into exclusive arrangements and in  we entered into a non exclusive arrangement with our mexican agent  elektra del milenio de cv the inability to enter into exclusive arrangements or to maintain our exclusive rights under our contracts could adversely affect our operations  revenue  and operating profit by  for example  allowing competitors to benefit from the goodwill associated with the western union brand at our agent locations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies 
the three major rating services  standard poor ratings services  moody investors service inc  and fitch inc  recently reduced our credit ratings to bbb  baa  and bbb  respectively  and placed us on negative outlook 
if our credit ratings are further downgraded  or if they are placed under review or continue to have a negative outlook  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged  which could adversely affect our relationships with our agents  particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices 
in addition  an adverse credit rating by a rating agency  such as a downgrade or negative outlook  could result in regulators imposing additional capital and other requirements on us  including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 
also  a downgrade below investment grade will increase our interest expense under certain of our notes and any significant downgrade could increase our costs of borrowing money more generally  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from productivity and cost savings and other related initiatives  which may include decisions to downsize or to transition operating activities from one location to another  and we may experience disruptions in our workforce as a result of those initiatives 
we have and are currently engaged in actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures 
we may implement additional initiatives in future periods 
while these initiatives are designed to increase productivity and result in cost savings  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits will be realized  and the costs to implement such initiatives may be greater than expected 
in addition  these initiatives have resulted and will likely result in the loss of personnel  some of whom may support significant systems or operations 
consequently  these initiatives could result in a disruption to our workforce 
if we do not realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives or the costs to implement them are greater than expected  or if the actions result in a disruption to our workforce greater than anticipated  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to protect our brands and our other intellectual property rights and to defend ourselves against potential intellectual property infringement claims

our intellectual property rights are an important element in the value of our business 
our failure to take appropriate actions against those who infringe upon our intellectual property could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings in the united states or in foreign countries could impair our ability to sell our services or license or protect our intellectual property  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been  are and in the future may be  subject to claims alleging that our technology or business methods infringe intellectual property rights of others  both inside and outside the united states

we have established contingency reserves for a variety of material  known tax exposures 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was a liability of million  including accrued interest and penalties  net of related benefits 
our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve  and such resolution could have a material effect on our effective tax rate  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in the current period and or future periods 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances ie new information surrounding a tax issue  and ii any difference from the company tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
such resolution could increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows 
for example  in  we reached an agreement with the united states internal revenue service irs resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in  which resulted in a tax benefit of million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter and requires cash payments to the irs and various state tax authorities of approximately million  of which million was paid in see the capital resources and liquidity discussion in part ii  item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
