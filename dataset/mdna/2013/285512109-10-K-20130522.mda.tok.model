item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a high level discussion of our operating results  as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms  including video game consoles such as the sony playstation  microsoft xbox  and nintendo wiiu  personal computers  mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones  tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle  and the internet 
our ability to publish games across multiple platforms  through multiple distribution channels  and directly to consumers online and wirelessly has been  and will continue to be  a cornerstone of our product strategy 
we have generated substantial growth in new business models and alternative revenue streams such as subscription  micro transactions  and advertising based on the continued expansion of our online and wireless product and service offerings 
some of our games are based on our wholly owned intellectual property eg  battlefield  mass effect  need for speed  the sims  bejeweled  and plants v 
zombies  and some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  fifa and madden nfl 
our goal is to turn our core intellectual properties into year round businesses available on a range of platforms 
our products and services may be purchased through physical and online retailers  platform providers such as console manufacturers and mobile carriers via digital downloads  as well as directly through our own distribution platform  including online portals such as origin 
financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was  million  down million as compared to the fiscal year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled games decreased by million as compared to march   directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled games increased by million as compared to march   directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march  without these changes in deferred net revenue  reported net revenue would have decreased by approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenue for fiscal year was driven by fifa  battlefield and fifa net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to a net income of million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to a diluted earnings per share of for the fiscal year ended march  net income increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of a million gain on strategic investment from the sale of our investment in neowiz and a million decrease in operating expenses 
the increase in net income was partially offset by a million decrease in gross profit due to an percent decrease in net revenue and a million increase in the provision for income taxes 
trends in our business next generation console systems 
both microsoft and sony have announced their plans to release new video game console systems in in addition  in november  nintendo released its wiiu  which succeeded the wii 
ea is investing in products and services for these next generation consoles 
in the near term  we expect to continue to develop and market products and services for current generation consoles including the xbox and playstation while also developing products and services for next generation console systems 
the success of our products and services for these next generation consoles depends in part on the commercial success and adequate supply of these new consoles  our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace  and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms 
digital content distribution and services 
consumers are spending an ever increasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online  or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones  or through social networks such as facebook 
we provide a variety of online delivered products and services including those available through our origin platform 
many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download via the internet 
we also offer online delivered content and services that are add ons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services 
further  we provide other games  content and services that are available only via electronic delivery  such as internet only games and game services  and games for mobile devices 
we significantly increased the revenue that we derive from wireless  internet derived and advertising digital products and services from  million in fiscal year to  million in fiscal year and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal and beyond 
wireless and internet platforms  casual and mobile games 
advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment 
examples include wireless technologies  streaming game services  and internet based platforms 
these technologies  services and platforms grow the consumer base for our business and have led to the growth of casual and mobile gaming 
casual and mobile games are characterized by their mass appeal  simple controls  flexible monetization including free to play and micro transaction business models and fun and approachable gameplay 
these games appeal to a larger consumer demographic including younger and older players and more female players than video games played on console devices 
we expect sales of casual and mobile games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 
concentration of sales among the most popular games 
we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles  and those titles are typically sequels of prior games 
we have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties 
we published primary packaged goods titles in fiscal year  in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year  we expect to release major titles 
evolving sales patterns 
our business has evolved from a traditional packaged goods business model to one where our games are played on a variety of platforms including mobile devices and social networking sites 
our strategy is to transform our core intellectual properties into year round businesses  with a steady flow of downloadable content and extensions on new platforms 
our increasingly digital  multi platform business no longer reflects the retail sales patterns associated with traditional packaged goods launches 
for example  we offer our consumers additional services and or additional content available through online services to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase 
our casual and mobile games offer free to play and micro transaction models 
the revenue we derive from these services has become increasingly more significant year over year 
our service revenue represented percent  percent  and percent of total net revenue in fiscal year   and  respectively 
recent developments stock repurchase program 
in july  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
under this program  we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws  including pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans 
the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price  capital availability  regulatory requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 
we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified  suspended or discontinued at any time 
during fiscal year  we repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million under this new program 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games  and related content and services on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wiiu and pcs  mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones  and tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle 
we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition and asc  software revenue recognition 
we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 
product revenue 
our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related content  whether delivered via a physical disc eg  packaged goods or via the internet eg  full game downloads  micro transactions  and licensing of game software to third parties 
product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support  and sales of tangible products such as hardware  peripherals  or collectors items 
service and other revenue 
our service revenue includes revenue recognized from time based subscriptions and games or related content that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content ie  cannot be played without an internet connection 
this includes entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services eg  micro transactions for internet based  social network and mobile games  massively multi player online mmo games both software game and subscription sales  subscriptions for our pogo branded online game services  and allocated service revenue from sales of software games with an online service element ie  matchmaking service 
our other revenue includes advertising and non software licensing revenue 
with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a matchmaking service mentioned above  our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management s best estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service with the residual value allocated to product revenue 
our estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service is comprised of several factors including  but not limited to  prior selling prices for the matchmaking service  prices charged separately by other third party vendors for similar service offerings  and a cost plus margin approach 
we review the estimated selling price of the online matchmaking service on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with a matchmaking service 
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement 
evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver the related products or services must be present 
fixed or determinable fee 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
collection is deemed probable 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable as the amounts become due  we generally conclude that collection becomes probable upon cash collection 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
for digital downloads  delivery is considered to occur when the software is made available to the customer for download 
for services and other  delivery is generally considered to occur as the service is delivered  which is determined based on the underlying service obligation 
online enabled games the majority of our software games can be connected to the internet whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a when and if available basis unspecified updates for use with the original game software 
in addition  we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet without a separate fee 
us gaap requires us to account for the consumer s right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a bundled sale  or multiple element arrangement 
we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates to online enabled software games eg  player roster updates to madden nfl at no additional charge to the consumer 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for these unspecified updates  and thus  as required by us gaap  we recognize revenue from the sale of these online enabled games over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer estimated offering period 
estimated offering period the offering period is not an explicitly defined period and thus  we recognize revenue over an estimated offering period  which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after delivery 
determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 
for example  in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our online enabled games  we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required 
during the first quarter of each fiscal year  we review consumers online gameplay of all online enabled games that have been released to months prior to the evaluation date 
for example  if our evaluation date is april   we evaluate all online enabled games released between april  and march  based on this population of games  for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public  we compute the weighted average number of days for each online enabled game  based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online 
we then compute the weighted average number of days for all online enabled games by multiplying the weighted average number of days for each online enabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these online enabled games ie  a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold 
under a similar computation  we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer 
based on the sum of these two calculations  we then consider the results from prior years  known online gameplay trends  as well as disclosed service periods for competitors games to determine the estimated offering period for future sales 
similar computations are also made for the estimated service period related to our mmo games  which is generally estimated to be eighteen months 
we are currently evaluating our estimated offering period for fiscal while we consistently apply this methodology  inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which online enabled games to sample  whether to use only units that have registered online  whether to weight the number of days for each game  whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game  determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends 
other multiple element arrangements in some of our multiple element arrangements  we sell tangible products with software and or software related offerings 
these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors items  such as figurines and comic books 
revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below 
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available  third party evidence tpe of fair value ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available  or our best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including  but not limited to  recent selling prices and related discounts  market conditions  customer classes  sales channels and other factors 
in accordance with asc  provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations 
we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element is delivered  determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements  as applicable 
changes to any of these assumptions and judgments  or changes to the elements in the arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves we reduce revenue primarily for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers channel partners 
price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product in the channel 
the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price 
in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products  we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance 
as a general practice  we do not give cash refunds 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze the following historical credit allowances  current sell through of our channel partner s inventory of our software products  current trends in retail and the video game industry  changes in customer demand  acceptance of our software products  and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing software products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue  accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  historical experience  age of current accounts receivable balances  changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers 
significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective  and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities and contingencies assumed  acquired in process technology  and contingent consideration issued in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill  which is an asset that is not amortized 
determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows 
determining the fair value of acquired in process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset 
determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability 
determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probability weighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled  and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation 
the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings 
significant changes in forecasted earnings would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement 
this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
assessment of impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets 
current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisition related intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows 
for some assets  our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful 
this success is dependent upon several factors  which are beyond our control  such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
in assessing impairment on our goodwill  we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the qualitative factors we assess include long term prospects of our performance  share price trends  and company specific events 
if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  we do not need to perform the two step impairment test 
if based on that assessment  we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a two step goodwill impairment test will be performed 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
reporting units are determined by the components of operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  and  as such  we did not need to perform the two step impairment test 
to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step  we use the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  the income approach  which utilizes discounted cash flows  or a combination thereof 
determining whether an event or change in circumstances does or does not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount is inherently subjective 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates  tax rates  and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying amount and we have not identified any indicators of impairment since that assessment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of developing  marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors  including the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell  which can be impacted by a number of variables  including product quality  the timing of the title s release and competition  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products 
furthermore  if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue  we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product  and therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor 
when performance remains with the licensor  we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 
royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next months 
each quarter  we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty based assets  as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of revenue 
we evaluate long lived royalty based assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist 
unrecognized minimum royalty based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts  and therefore  any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making this determination  we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 
it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results  particularly in light of the economic environment 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income  we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets  namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments 
each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence  this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity 
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 
based on the assumptions and requirements noted above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability in the united states  or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation  as well as with respect to other matters  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international corporate structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 
we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  and accordingly  no us taxes have been provided thereon 
we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 
results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a or week period that ends on the saturday nearest march our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and each contained weeks and ended on march   march   and april   respectively 
for simplicity of disclosure  all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end 
net revenue net revenue consists of sales generated from video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wiiu and pcs  video games for mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones  video games for tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle  separate software products and content and online game services associated with these products  programming third party websites with our game content  allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products  and advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 
we provide three different measures of our net revenue 
two of these measures are presented in accordance with us gaap net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue and net revenue by geography 
the third measure is a non gaap financial measure net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition  which is primarily based on method of distribution 
we use this third non gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance  when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods  and when assessing the performance of our management team 
management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue 
these two measures differ as net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to us gaap while net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition does not  and both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another 
for instance  service and other revenue does not include the majority of our full game digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue 
further  service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or publishing and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a full game digital download or a packaged goods sale

net revenue before revenue deferral  a non gaap financial measure  is provided in this section of md a  including a discussion of the components of this measure publishing and other  wireless  internet derived  and advertising digital  and distribution 
see non gaap financial measures below for an explanation of our use of this non gaap financial measure 
a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with us gaap is provided in the discussion below 
revenue deferral in this net revenue section generally includes the unrecognized revenue from bundled sales of certain online enabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates 
fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed  while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon the amount deferred  the period of time the software related offerings are to be provided  and the timing of the sale 
for example  most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year  however  substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year

for fiscal year  publishing and other net revenue before revenue deferral was  million  primarily driven by fifa  madden nfl  and need for speed most wanted 
publishing and other net revenue before revenue deferral for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this decrease was driven by a  million decrease in sales primarily from the battlefield and mass effect franchises  as well as star wars the old republic 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in sales primarily from the fifa  medal of honor  and dead space franchises 
wireless  internet derived  and advertising digital revenue digital revenue includes revenue from sales of our internally developed and co published game software distributed through direct download through the internet  including through our direct to consumer platform origin  or distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers 
this includes our full game downloads  mobile and tablet revenue each of which are generally classified as product revenue with the exception of our mmo game downloads and freemium mobile games which are classified as service revenue as well as subscription services  micro transactions  and advertising revenues each of which is generally classified as service and other revenue 
for fiscal year  digital net revenue before deferral was  million  an increase of million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this increase is due to a million or percent increase in extra content and free to play sales primarily driven by the fifa and bejeweled franchises  along with star wars the old republic  a million or percent increase in subscription and advertising sales primarily driven by battlefield premium subscriptions  an million or percent increase in mobile sales primarily driven by the simpsons tapped out and fifa world class soccer 
these increases were partially offset by a million or percent decrease in full game download sales primarily driven by star wars the old republic and the battlefield franchise 
distribution revenue for fiscal year  distribution net revenue was million and decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year  due to a decrease in sales primarily from the portal franchise and to a lesser extent  our switzerland distribution business 
revenue deferral revenue deferral for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in net revenue before revenue deferral related to our publishing and other sales  which was partially offset by a higher percentage of digital sales being deferred and recognized over time  due in part to a percent increase in extra content and free to play sales  a percent increase in subscription and advertising revenue  a percent increase in mobile sales  all of which contain an online service component requiring revenue recognition over the period of time that the service is delivered 
recognition of revenue deferral our non distribution sales are generally deferred and recognized over a weighted average six month period  and therefore  the related revenue recognized in any fiscal year is primarily due to sales that occurred during the respective twelve months period ended december the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to lower publishing sales during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in fiscal year we anticipate that our fiscal year net revenue will be lower than our fiscal year net revenue as a result of a change in our estimated offering period  partially offset by an increase in sales 
while we have not completed our evaluation of our estimated offering period for fiscal year  we anticipate our weighted average estimated offering period for our products and services to be longer than our historical experience of generally six months as consumers are spending more time playing our games online 
we do not expect this change in estimated offering period to impact the amount of net revenue before revenue deferral or operating cash flows we report 
we expect net revenue to be up to million lower than net revenue before deferral in fiscal year due primarily to the change in estimated offering period

we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period  and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably 
we use this non gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance  when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods  and when assessing the performance of our management team 
while we believe that this non gaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business  this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap

income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal years and was as follows in millions march  effective tax rate march  effective tax rate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was a tax expense of 
the fiscal year effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of percent primarily due to the us losses for which no benefit is recognized and non deductible stock based compensation  offset by non us profits subject to reduced or zero tax rates and the nontaxable change in the estimated fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was a tax benefit of percent 
in fiscal year  we recorded approximately million of additional net deferred tax liabilities related to the popcap and klicknation corporation klicknation acquisitions 
these additional deferred tax liabilities create a new source of taxable income  thereby requiring us to release a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance with a related reduction in income tax expense of million 
in addition  during the three months ended march   we recorded million of additional tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations in non us tax jurisdictions 
the fiscal year effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and non us profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rate  partially offset by non deductible stock based compensation 
in addition  the fiscal year effective tax rate is impacted by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities  as well as a reduction in the us valuation allowance related to the popcap and klicknation acquisitions 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal year and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 
the american taxpayer relief act of the act was signed into law on january  the act contains a number of provisions including  most notably  an extension of the research tax credit through december  the act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets

under this plan  we reduced our workforce  terminated licensing agreements  and consolidated or closed various facilities 
as of march   we have completed all actions under this restructuring plan 
since the inception of the fiscal restructuring plan through march   we have incurred charges of million  consisting of million in employee related expenses  million related to license termination costs  and million related to the closure of certain of our facilities 
substantially all of these costs have been settled in cash as of march   with the exception of approximately million of license and lease termination costs  which will be settled by august we expect to incur cash expenditures through august of approximately million through fiscal year and less than million thereafter 
fiscal restructuring in connection with our fiscal restructuring plan  we expect to incur cash expenditures through june of approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the actual cash expenditures are variable as they will be dependent upon the actual revenue we generate from certain games 
financing arrangement in july  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations which pay interest semi annually in arrears at a rate of percent per annum on january and july of each year  beginning on january  and will mature on july   unless earlier purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion value of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion of the notes  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock 
we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance the cash consideration of our acquisition of popcap  which closed in august prior to april   the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods  and thereafter  at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes 
the notes do not contain any financial covenants 
the conversion rate is subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest 
following certain corporate events described in the indenture governing the notes the indenture that occur prior to the maturity date  the conversion rate will be increased for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such corporate event in certain circumstances 
the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity  and no sinking fund is provided for the notes 
if we undergo a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  subject to certain conditions  holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes 
the fundamental change purchase price will be percent of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the fundamental change purchase date 
the indenture contains customary terms and covenants  including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing  either the trustee or the holders of at least percent in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare percent of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable 
in addition  in july  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions the convertible note hedge with certain counterparties to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes 
the convertible note hedge  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  provide us with the option to acquire  on a net settlement basis  approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of  which corresponds to the conversion price of the notes and is equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes 
as of march   we have not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge 
we paid million for the convertible note hedge 
separately  we have also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments that are substantially the same as the anti dilution provisions contained in the notes  up to million shares of our common stock which is also equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes  with a strike price of 
the warrants could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants 
we received proceeds of million from the sale of the warrants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our convertible senior notes due credit facility on august   we entered into a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the credit facility terminates on february  and contains an option to arrange with existing lenders and or new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of million in additional commitments for revolving loans 
proceeds of loans made under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 
the loans bear interest  at our option  at the base rate plus an applicable spread or an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable spread  in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding fiscal quarter 
we are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type 
interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate 
principal  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  is due and payable on february  the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  incur subsidiary indebtedness  grant liens  dispose of all or substantially all assets and pay dividends or make distributions  in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 
we are also required to maintain compliance with a capitalization ratio and maintain a minimum level of total liquidity and a minimum level of domestic liquidity 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including among others  non payment defaults  covenant defaults  bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and a change of control default  in each case  subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit agreement  an obligation by any guarantors to repay the obligations in full and an increase in the applicable interest rate 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
financial condition we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and potentially  future acquisitions  stock repurchases  or strategic investments 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate expansion  repurchase our stock  pursue strategic acquisitions and investments  and or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
there can be no assurance  however  that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
as of march   approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions 
while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term  if we choose to do so  we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 
in february  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over the following months 
we completed our program in april we repurchased approximately million shares in the open market since under that program  including pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans 
during fiscal years and  we repurchased and retired approximately million and million shares of our common stock for approximately million and million  respectively  under that plan 
in july  our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
under this new program  we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws  including pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans 
the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price  capital availability  regulatory requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 
we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified  suspended or discontinued at any time 
during fiscal year  we repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million under this new program 
during fiscal years and  we repurchased and retired approximately million and million shares of our common stock for approximately million and million  respectively  for both plans 
we have a shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec 
this shelf registration statement  which includes a base prospectus  allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings 
unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus  we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes  including for working capital  financing capital expenditures  research and development  marketing and distribution efforts  and if opportunities arise  for acquisitions or strategic alliances 
pending such uses  we may invest the net proceeds in interest bearing securities 
in addition  we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time 
our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  those related to customer demand and acceptance of our products  our ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due  successfully achieving our product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales objectives  the impact of acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may engage  the impact of competition  economic conditions in the united states and abroad  the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating results  risks of product returns and the other risks described in the risk factors section  included in part i  item a of this report 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments development  celebrity  league and content licenses payments and commitments the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers  artists  software programmers and by non employee software developers independent artists or third party developers 
we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games  usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones 
contractually  these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products 
these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers 
in addition  we have certain celebrity  league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables 
celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa  fifpro foundation  fapl football association premier league limited  and dfl deutsche fu ball liga gmbh german soccer league professional soccer  national basketball association professional basketball  pga tour  tiger woods and augusta national professional golf  national hockey league and nhl players association professional hockey  national football league properties  players inc  and red bear inc 
professional football  collegiate licensing company collegiate football  zuffa  llc ultimate fighting championship  espn content in ea sports games  hasbro  inc most of hasbro s toy and game intellectual properties  and lucasarts and lucas licensing star wars the old republic 
these developer and content license commitments represent the sum of the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements and the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements  the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty 
these minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below 
the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of march   and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions fiscal year ending march  total thereafter unrecognized commitments developer licensor commitments marketing commitments operating leases convertible senior notes due interest a other purchase obligations total unrecognized commitments recognized commitments convertible senior notes due principal a licensing and lease obligations b total recognized commitments total commitments a included in the million coupon interest on the convertible senior notes due is million of accrued interest recognized as of march  we will be obligated to pay the million principal amount of the convertible senior notes due in cash and any excess conversion value in shares of our common stock upon redemption of the notes at maturity on july  or upon earlier redemption 
the million principal amount excludes million of unamortized discount of the liability component 
see note for additional information regarding our convertible senior notes due b see note for additional information regarding recognized commitments resulting from our restructuring plans 
lease commitments have not been reduced for approximately million due in the future from third parties under non cancelable sub leases 
subsequent to march   we entered into various licensor and development agreements with third parties  which contingently commits us to pay up to million at various dates through fiscal year the unrecognized amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimum cash obligations for the respective fiscal years  but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be recognized and expensed in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the amounts in the table above are presented based on the dates the amounts are contractually due as of march   however  certain payment obligations may be accelerated depending on the performance of our operating results 
in addition to what is included in the table above  as of march   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million  of which approximately million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution 
for the remaining liability  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
also  in addition to what is included in the table above as of march   primarily in connection with our popcap  klicknation  and chillingo acquisitions  we may be required to pay an additional million of cash consideration based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through march  as of march   we have accrued million of contingent consideration on our consolidated balance sheet representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration 
we have not paid any earn out to date for the popcap acquisition 
off balance sheet commitments lease commitments as of march   we leased certain of our current facilities  furniture and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
we were required to pay property taxes  insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities 
director indemnity agreements we entered into indemnification agreements with each of the members of our board of directors at the time they joined the board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities  costs  expenses  amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit  or any judicial  administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 
inflation we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and market prices  which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below 
while we do not hedge our short term investment portfolio  we protect our short term investment portfolio against different market risks  including interest rate risk as discussed below 
our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk cash flow hedging activities 
from time to time  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses  as appropriate  in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective  the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reclassified to interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur  or it becomes remote that they will occur  within the defined hedge period  the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  we reclassified an immaterial amount of losses into interest and other income expense  net 
our hedging programs are designed to reduce  but do not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currency 
all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march  will mature in the next months 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march  and  these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of million and million  respectively  and are included in other current assets 
balance sheet hedging activities 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end 
our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments  and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in certain cases  the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary asset or liability  in which case our results will be impacted 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars  and million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material  a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure credit worthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of million and million  respectively 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
however  because short term investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments 
additionally  the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale securities and  consequently  were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  corporate bonds us treasury securities us agency securities commercial paper total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value in our short term investment portfolio as of march   arising from potential changes in interest rates
