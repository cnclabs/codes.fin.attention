associates at february   we had approximately  active associates comprised of  full time and  part time associates 
temporary associates hired during the fall and winter holiday selling season increased the number of associates to a peak of approximately  in approximately of the associates employed throughout the year are employed on a part time basis 
we consider our relationship with our associates to be good  and we are not a party to any labor agreements 
competition we operate in the highly competitive retail industry 
we face strong sales competition from other general merchandise  discount  food  furniture  arts and crafts  and dollar store retailers  who operate in traditional brick and mortar stores and or the e commerce marketplace 
additionally  we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations  to attract and retain quality employees  and to acquire our broad assortment of closeout merchandise from vendors 

table of contents purchasing an integral part of our business is the sourcing and purchasing of quality closeout merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors typically at prices below those paid by traditional retailers 
we believe that we have built strong relationships with many brand name vendors and we have capitalized on our purchasing power in the closeout marketplace  including our ability to pay timely 
we believe our vendor relationships and purchasing power enable us to source merchandise that provides exceptional value to our customers 
we have the ability to source and purchase significant quantities of a vendor closeout merchandise in specific product categories and to control distribution in accordance with vendor instructions 
we believe this ability provides a high level of service and convenience to our vendors 
we supplement our traditional brand name closeout purchases with direct import and domestically sourced merchandise  which represents merchandise that our customers expect us to consistently stock in our stores or merchandise that we believe offers our customers a significant value 
our sourcing channels also include bankruptcies  liquidations  and insurance claims 
we expect that the unpredictability of the retail and manufacturing environments coupled with what we believe is our dominant purchasing power position will continue to support our ability to source quality closeout merchandise at competitive prices 
we have a merchandising team with extensive closeout purchasing experience  which we believe has enabled us to develop successful long term relationships with many of the largest and most recognized vendors in north america 
as a result of our relationships and our experience and reputation in the closeout industry  we believe many vendors offer buying opportunities to us prior to attempting to dispose of their merchandise through other channels 
our merchandise is purchased from a broad vendor base of more than  domestic and foreign vendors 
in  our top ten vendors accounted for approximately of total purchases at cost while the largest vendor accounted for approximately of total purchases at cost 
during  we purchased approximately of our merchandise directly from overseas vendors  including approximately from vendors located in china 
additionally  a significant amount of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad 
as a result  a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks as described further in item a 
risk factors of this form k 
warehouse and distribution the majority of the merchandise we sell is received and processed for retail sale and distributed to the retail locations from our seven regional distribution centers 
our us segment is serviced by regional distribution centers located in pennsylvania  ohio  alabama  oklahoma  and california 
our canadian segment is serviced by regional distribution centers located in british columbia and ontario 
while a few of our merchandise vendors deliver merchandise directly to our stores  the large majority of our inventory is managed through our distribution centers to facilitate prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores and maximize our sales and inventory turnover rate 
we selected the locations of our distribution centers in the us in an effort to minimize transportation costs and the distance from distribution centers to our stores 
in addition to the regional distribution centers that handle merchandise  we operate a warehouse in ohio that distributes fixtures and supplies to our stores 
for additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives  see the discussion under the caption warehouse and distribution in item properties of this form k and the discussion under the caption operating strategy cost structure in the accompanying md a in this form k 
advertising and promotion our brand image is an important part of our marketing program 
our principal trademarks  including the big lots family of trademarks  have been registered with the us patent and trademark office and are either registered or pending registration with the canadian intellectual property office 
we use a variety of marketing approaches to promote our brand and retail position through television  internet  in store point of purchase  and print media 

table of contents the centerpiece of our us marketing efforts is our television campaign which combines elements of strategic branding and promotion 
these same elements are also used in most of our other marketing media 
our highly targeted media placement strategy uses national cable as the foundation of our television buys which is then supplemented with commercials placed with broadcast networks in key markets 
in all markets served by our us stores  we design and distribute printed advertising circulars  through a combination of newspaper insertions and mailings 
in  we distributed multi page circulars covering weeks which included three additional circulars compared to and we create regional versions of these circulars to take advantage of market differences caused by product availability  climate  and customer preferences 
in addition  we use in store promotional materials  including in store signage  to emphasize special bargains and significant values offered to our customers 
since we acquired big lots canada  inc  our marketing efforts in canada have been limited to in store promotional materials 
our marketing focus in canada has been on enhancing the presentation of our stores 
in  we began evaluating our branding and promotional advertising strategies in canada based on what actions will assist us in accomplishing our future operational goals and we will begin implementing those which we believe will generate incremental sales 
our customer list  which we refer to as the buzz club in the us  is an important marketing tool that allows us to communicate in a cost effective manner with our customers  including e mail delivery of our circulars 
in addition to the buzz club  in august  we started the buzz club rewards program rewards  which has grown rapidly from million members at the end of to million members at the end of members of the rewards program may earn discounts on future purchases and receive targeted promotions 
total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was in each of   and seasonality we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability  with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings  the timing of television and circular advertising  and the timing of certain holidays 
we historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise  carry higher inventory levels  and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the fourth fiscal quarter typically includes a leveraging effect on operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs  such as rent and depreciation  are fixed and do not vary as sales levels escalate 
the seasonality of our net sales and related merchandise inventory requirements influences our availability of and demand for cash or access to credit 
we historically have drawn upon our credit facility to assist in funding our working capital requirements  which typically peak near the end of our third fiscal quarter 
we historically have higher net sales  operating profits  and cash flow provided by operations in the fourth fiscal quarter which allows us to substantially repay our seasonal borrowings 
in  our total indebtedness outstanding borrowings and letters of credit peaked in november at approximately million under our five year million unsecured credit facility entered into in july credit agreement 
at february   our total indebtedness under the credit agreement was million  which included million in borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit 
we expect that borrowings will vary throughout depending on various factors  including our seasonal need to acquire merchandise inventory prior to the peak selling season  and the timing and amount of sales to our customers

risk factors the statements in this section describe the material risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
in addition  these statements constitute cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of our disclosure and analysis in this form k and in our annual report to shareholders contain forward looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
from time to time  we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward looking statements 
such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events  they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
such statements are commonly identified by using words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  objective  goal  project  intend  plan  believe  will  should  may  target  forecast  guidance  outlook  and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  forward looking statements include statements relating to future actions  future performance  or results of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  interest rates  the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties  and potential inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated  estimated  or projected results set forth in the forward looking statements 
you should bear this in mind as you consider forward looking statements 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date thereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k filed with the sec 
also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of material risks  uncertainties  and assumptions relevant to our businesses 
there can be no assurances that we have correctly and completely identified  assessed  and accounted for all factors that do or may affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we presently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
consequently  all of the forward looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements  and there can be no assurance that the results or developments we anticipate will be realized or that they will have the expected effects on our business or operations 
we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

table of contents our ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward looking statements is subject to a number of factors  any one  or a combination  of which could materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
these factors may include  but are not limited to the current economic conditions including commodity price fluctuations and sustained elevated underemployment give rise to risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity including  but not limited to the following fluctuating commodity prices  including but not limited to diesel fuel and other fuels used to generate power by utilities  may affect our gross profit and operating profit margins 
our expectations regarding the demand for our merchandise may be inaccurate  which could cause us to under buy or over buy certain categories or departments of merchandise  which could result in customer dissatisfaction or require excessive markdowns to sell through the merchandise 
our customers may experience reduced disposable income due to increases in withholdings on personal payroll taxes associated with the social security in the united states and other governmental programs 
the reaction of our competitors to the marketplace may drive our competitors  some of whom are better capitalized than us  to offer significant discounts or promotions on their merchandise  which could negatively affect our sales and profit margins 
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital or could increase the borrowing rates we pay 
if we are unable to continue to successfully execute our operating strategies in our us segment  our operating performance could be significantly impacted 
there is a risk that we will be unable to meet or exceed our operating performance targets and goals in the future if our strategies and initiatives are unsuccessful 
in  we announced operating performance targets and goals as part of an updated strategic plan that we intended to use as our roadmap for the future 
we continued to execute on that plan in  which included a growth phase and a continued focus on merchandising  real estate  and cost structure 
during  our senior management performed a review and provided our board of directors with an updated view of our strategic plan for and beyond 
in december  we announced the intention of our chairman  chief executive officer and president  steven s 
fishman  to retire in  once his successor has been identified 
the successful hiring of a new chief executive officer and the completion of the review our strategic plan could impact our abilities to meet our operating performance targets 
see the accompanying md a in this form k for additional information concerning our operating strategy 
if we are unable to successfully implement our operating strategies in our canadian segment  our operating performance could be significantly impacted 
in  we acquired liquidation world inc as an avenue for entry into the canadian retail market  which was not specifically included in the strategic plan announced in  but fell within the growth phase goals of our overall plan 
in  the company began implementing an operating strategy in canada similar to that of our us segment 
if we are unable to successfully complete the implementation of this strategy in canada  such failure could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated operating performance and the value of our goodwill and intangibles assets associated with the canadian segment could be negatively affected 
see the accompanying md a in this form k for additional information concerning our operating strategy 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive discount retail industry  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the discount retail business  which includes both traditional brick and mortar stores and the e commerce marketplace  is highly competitive 
as discussed in item of this form k  we compete for customers  products  employees  real estate  and other aspects of our business with a number of other companies 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  distribution  marketing  and other resources than us 
it is possible that increased competition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our market share  gross margin  and operating margin  and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways 

table of contents if we are unable to compete effectively with the growing e commerce sector  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
with the continued expansion of mobile computing devices and smart phones  competition from the e commerce sector continues to grow and our current operating strategy does not include plans for expansion into the on line marketplace 
certain of our competitors  and a number of e commerce retailers  have established e commerce operations against which we compete for customers and products 
it is possible that the increasing competition from the e commerce sector may reduce our market share  gross margin  and operating margin  and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways 
changes by vendors related to the management of their inventories may reduce the quantity and quality of brand name closeout merchandise available to us or may increase our cost to acquire brand name closeout merchandise  either of which may materially adversely affect our revenues and gross margin 
for the closeout component of our business  we do not control the supply  design  function  availability  or cost of many of the products that we offer for sale in our stores 
our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets for gross margin depends upon the sufficient availability of closeout merchandise that we can acquire and offer at prices that represent a value to our customers 
in addition  we rely on our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise 
to the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory  the amount of closeout merchandise available to us could be materially reduced 
shortages or disruptions in the availability of closeout merchandise of a quality acceptable to our customers and us would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross margin and may result in customer dissatisfaction 
we rely on vendors located in foreign countries for significant amounts of merchandise and a significant amount of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad 
our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade 
global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in driving higher gross margin 
during  we purchased approximately of our products directly from overseas vendors including from vendors located in china 
our ability to identify qualified vendors and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge  especially with respect to goods sourced outside of north america 
global sourcing and foreign trade involve numerous factors and uncertainties beyond our control including increased shipping costs  increased import duties  more restrictive quotas  loss of most favored nation trading status  currency and exchange rate fluctuations  work stoppages  transportation delays  economic uncertainties such as inflation  foreign government regulations  political unrest  natural disasters  war  terrorism  trade restrictions including retaliation by the united states against foreign practices  political instability  the financial stability of vendors  merchandise quality issues  and tariffs 
these and other issues affecting our international vendors could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance 
disruption to our distribution network  the capacity of our distribution centers  and the timely receipt of merchandise inventory could adversely affect our operating performance 
we rely on our ability to replenish depleted merchandise inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers and from the distribution centers to our stores by various means of transportation  including shipments by sea  rail and truck carriers 
a decrease in the capacity of carriers and or labor strikes or shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect our distribution network  the timely receipt of merchandise and transportation costs 
in addition  long term disruptions to north american and international transportation infrastructure from wars  political unrest  terrorism  natural disasters  governmental budget constraints and other significant events that lead to delays or interruptions of service could adversely affect our business 
also  a fire  earthquake  or other disaster at one of our distribution centers could disrupt our timely receipt  processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business 
as we continue to expand our operations  we may face increased or unexpected demands on distribution center operations  as well as unexpected demands on our distribution network 
in addition  new store locations receiving shipments that are increasingly further away from our distribution centers will increase transportation costs  accentuated by rising fuel prices  and may create transportation scheduling strains 

table of contents our inability to properly manage our inventory levels and offer merchandise that our customers want may materially impact our business and financial performance 
we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully 
however  we also must seek to avoid accumulating excess inventory in order to maintain appropriate in stock levels 
as stated above  we obtain approximately one quarter of our merchandise from vendors outside of north america 
these foreign vendors often require lengthy advance notice of our requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities that we request 
this usually requires us to order merchandise and enter into purchase order contracts for the purchase of such merchandise well in advance of the time these products are offered for sale 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in responding to a changing retail environment  which makes us vulnerable to changes in price and in consumer preferences 
in addition  we attempt to maximize our gross margin and operating efficiency by delivering proper quantities of merchandise to our stores in a timely manner 
if we do not accurately anticipate future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to replenish inventory levels  our inventory levels may not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted 
declines in general economic condition  disposable income levels  and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise thereby materially affecting our revenues and gross margin 
our results of operations can be directly impacted by the health of the economies of the united states and canada 
our business and financial performance may be adversely impacted by current and future economic conditions  including factors that may restrict or otherwise negatively impact consumer financing  disposable income levels  unemployment levels  energy costs  interest rates  recession  inflation  the impact of unseasonable weather  natural disasters or terrorist activities and other matters that influence consumer spending 
specifically  our furniture  home  and seasonal categories are threatened when disposable income levels are negatively impacted by economic conditions 
additionally  our cyclical product offerings in our seasonal category are threatened when we experience extended periods of unseasonable weather 
in particular  the economic conditions and weather patterns of four states ohio  texas  california  and florida are important as approximately of our current stores operate in these states and of our net sales occurred in these states 
changes in federal or state provincial legislation and regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on product safety  could increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our operating performance 
we are exposed to the risk that new federal or state provincial legislation  including new product safety laws and regulations  may negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our operating performance 
additional changes in product safety legislation or regulations may lead to product recalls and the disposal or write off of merchandise  as well as fines or penalties and reputational damage 
if our merchandise  including food and consumable products  do not meet applicable governmental safety standards or our customers expectations regarding quality or safety  we could experience lost sales  increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements  or execute product recalls in a timely manner  could result in fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause us to lose market share to our competitors 
if this occurs  it may be difficult for us to regain lost sales 
we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings  including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
from time to time  we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions  including various collective or class action lawsuits that are brought against us for alleged violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we may not be able to accurately determine the impact on us of any future adverse outcome of such proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves 
for a description of certain current legal proceedings  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance 
our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles  self insured retentions  limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations 
however  we may incur certain types of losses that we cannot insure or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure  such as losses due to acts of war  employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters 
if we incur these losses and they are material  our business could suffer 
certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases 
to offset negative cost trends in the insurance market  we may elect to self insure  accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes 
in addition  we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  including automobile  and group health insurance programs 
unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses  including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs  could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events  we are self insured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles 
if we experience a greater number of self insured losses than we anticipate  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
a significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
we are required by accounting rules to periodically assess our property and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and deferred tax assets for impairment and recognize an impairment loss or valuation charge  if necessary 
in performing these assessments for our us segment  we use our historical financial performance to determine whether we have potential impairments or valuation concerns and as evidence to support our assumptions about future financial performance 
in relation to our canadian segment  we use our estimate of future financial performance in performing these assessments exclusive of matters associated with deferred tax assets as we do not believe that past performance is indicative of the future performance of the segment 
if our financial performance significantly declines  it could negatively affect the results of our assessments of the recoverability of our property and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and our deferred tax assets 
a significant decline in our future operating results could impair our ability to recover the value of these assets 
impairment or valuation charges taken against property and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and deferred tax assets could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity see the discussion under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates in the accompanying md a in this form k for additional information regarding our accounting policies for long lived assets  goodwill  and income taxes 
our inability  if any  to comply with the terms of the credit agreement may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
we have the ability to borrow funds under the credit agreement and we utilize this ability at various times depending on operating or other cash flow requirements 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens  and investments  as well as the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of any of these covenants may permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access loans and letters of credit and may require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans 
our failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
if we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner  our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient 
we depend on a variety of information systems for the efficient functioning of our business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business 
the software programs supporting many of our systems are licensed to us by independent software developers 
costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business 

table of contents if we are unable to retain existing and secure suitable new store locations under favorable lease terms  our financial performance may be negatively affected 
we lease almost all of our stores and a significant number of these leases expire or are up for renewal each year  as noted below in item properties to this form k 
our strategy to improve our financial performance includes sales growth while managing the occupancy cost of each of our stores 
a significant component of our sales growth strategy is to open new store locations 
if the commercial real estate market tightens and we are not able to negotiate favorable new store leases and lease renewals  our financial position  results of operations  and liquidity may be negatively affected 
if we are unable to attract  train  and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs  our financial performance may be negatively affected 
our customers expect a positive shopping experience  which is driven by a high level of customer service from our associates and a quality presentation of our merchandise 
to grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers  we must attract  train  and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates  while at the same time control labor costs 
we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly and part time positions 
these positions have historically had high turnover rates  which can lead to increased training and retention costs 
in addition  our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors  including prevailing wage rates  the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or benefits  and health insurance costs 
the loss of key personnel may have a material impact on our future results of operations 
we believe that we benefit substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives 
the loss of services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on our business 
in  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  steven s 
fishman announced his intentions to retire in after his successor is identified 
competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will depend on our ability to recruit  train  and retain our senior executives and other qualified personnel 
changes in accounting guidance could significantly affect our results of operations and the presentation of those results 
changes in accounting standards  including new interpretations and applications of accounting standards  may have adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
the governing accounting bodies  specifically the financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb  have proposed numerous significant changes to current accounting standards 
this proposed new guidance could significantly change the presentation of financial information and results of operations 
additionally  the new guidance may require us to make systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs 
specifically  implementing future accounting guidance related to leases and other areas impacted by the current convergence project between the fasb and iasb could require us to make significant changes to our lease management system or other accounting systems 
if we are unable to secure company  employee  and customer data  our systems could be compromised  our reputation could be damaged  and we could be subject to penalties or lawsuits 
the protection of our company  employee  and customer data is critical to us 
potential breaches of our systems could cause significant operational issues or disrupt the allocation or flow of merchandise to our stores 
in addition  our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business 
a significant breach of company  employee  or customer data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales  fines  and or lawsuits 
the price of our common shares as traded on the new york stock exchange may be volatile 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of factors beyond our control  including but not limited to  general economic and stock market conditions  risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above  strategic actions by us or our competitors  variations in our quarterly operating performance  our future sales or purchases of our common shares  and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common shares relative to other investment alternatives 

table of contents the bankruptcy of our formerly owned kb toys business may adversely affect our financial performance 
in december  we sold the kb toys business to kb acquisition corporation 
on january   kb acquisition corporation and certain affiliated entities collectively kb i filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to chapter of title of the united states code 
on august   in connection with the acquisition by an affiliate of prentice capital management of majority ownership of kb i  kb i emerged from their january  bankruptcy the kb toys business that emerged from bankruptcy is hereinafter referred to as kb ii 
on december   kb ii filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to chapter of title of the united states code 
based on information we have received subsequent to the december  bankruptcy filing  we believe we still may have indemnification and guarantee obligations kb ii bankruptcy lease obligations with respect to kb toys store leases 
because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability  our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
for additional information regarding the kb toys bankruptcies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also may be subject to a number of other factors which may  individually or in the aggregate  materially or adversely affect our business 
these factors include  but are not limited to changes in governmental laws and regulations  including matters related to taxation  events or circumstances could occur which could create bad publicity for us or for types of merchandise offered in our stores which may negatively impact our business results including sales  infringement of our intellectual property  including the big lots trademarks  could dilute our value  our ability to establish effective advertising  marketing  and promotional programs  and other risks described from time to time in our filings with the sec

table of contents operating strategy in  mr 
fishman joined us as our chief executive officer  chairman and president and introduced our current operating strategy  the what important now strategy win strategy 
the win strategy focuses on three key elements of our business merchandising  real estate  and cost structure 
the win strategy was designed to increase the operating profit performance of our existing store base 
in  driven by both the improvements in our store productivity and the softening of the commercial real estate market  we expanded our win strategy to also include the pursuit of net new store growth 
in  our board of directors approved the purchase of liquidation world inc  a canadian closeout retailer  with the expectation that the management team could implement the key elements of the win strategy to produce a profitable turnaround strategy while growing a store base in canada 
from to  we grew our net store count by stores  or  including stores acquired through the purchase of liquidation world  inc additionally  over the past three years  we have reinvested million in our business through capital expenditures and billion was returned to shareholders through publicly announced share repurchase programs 
although mr 
fishman has announced his intentions to retire in  we anticipate that the key elements of the win strategy will remain consistent in during  the company intends to announce the hiring of a new chief executive officer  who we expect to assess the current win strategy initiatives and finalize our strategic plan for future years 
in  we anticipate earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be to net sales to increase in both the us and canada us comparable stores sales in the range of flat to increase and growth of to in total net sales 
canadian comparable stores sales increase of to and growth of to in total net sales 
opening new stores and closing stores  for net growth of stores in the us additionally  in canada  we expect to open to new stores under the big lots name while closing a similar number of liquidation world or lw stores 
cash flow operating activities less investing activities of approximately million for future reinvestment  return to shareholders  or to lower our obligations under the credit agreement 
the following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our win strategy in our us segment and the implementation of the win strategy in our canadian segment 
the compared to section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results 
us segment merchandising from a merchandising perspective  we believe our competitive positioning as the largest broadline closeout retailer in the us affords us a strategic advantage when sourcing merchandise for our stores 
we source our merchandise in three key ways manufacturers and vendors have closeout merchandise for a number of different reasons including other retailers canceling orders  other retailers going out of business  marketing or packaging changes  a new product launch that has failed  and various other reasons 
in these situations  we are able to source product at a discounted cost and offer significant value to our customers 
we currently have thousands of vendor relationships for closeout inventory that we have developed over many years 
we believe these relationships and the size and financial strength of our company give us a competitive advantage 
for certain merchandise categories  there is not always an abundant supply of closeout inventory 
in these situations  we may work with vendors to develop product  some of which is imported 
imports totaled approximately of our merchandise purchases in categories with the highest concentration of imports include seasonal  furniture  and to a lesser extent the home category and the toys department 

table of contents our merchandise mix also includes replenishable and private or captive label products 
this type of merchandise is consistently available  and as a result  it can be offered in our stores on a regular basis 
this merchandise has many of the same characteristics as our closeout merchandise but is reorderable upon demand 
our prices for replenishable and private or captive label products are generally positioned below our competition  but to a lesser extent than our closeout sourced merchandise 
we offer seven major merchandise categories in our store food  consumables  furniture  home  seasonal  hardlines toys  and electronics other 
furniture is the largest category at of sales in and hardlines toys is the smallest category at of sales in in the fourth quarter of  we realigned certain of our merchandise departments and categories to be consistent with the restructuring of our merchandising teams and management structure 
please see the section compared to below for further discussion on the realignment of our merchandise categories 
during mr 
fishman tenure  our merchandising strategies to increase sales have been predominantly focused on increasing the average transaction value 
we have employed two primary methods to accomplish this goal drive more units per transaction  and grow the average item retail price by offering our customers better quality merchandise  better values  and more prominent brand name products 
this approach is consistent with our customer research that suggests that our core customer recognizes quality and brands and is willing to pay a higher retail price  if the value or cost savings remains significant compared to what other retailers are offering 
this strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores  which has benefited our cost structure 
while executing our win strategy  we have made measurable progress towards our goals of growing sales per selling square foot which increased from per square foot in to per square foot in  for our us segment and increasing gross margin dollars which increased from  million in to  million in  for our us segment 
from a merchandising perspective  our goal in is to continue to provide extreme value  improve quality  and expand the presence of recognizable brand name merchandise in our stores 
we expect our major merchandise offerings will remain the same as in prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to acquire 
for example in  we will install coolers and freezers in a group of stores regionally dispersed throughout the country in order to test sales of frozen and refrigerated foods and beverages 
the coolers and freezers test will introduce new merchandise to our current customer base while also qualifying our stores to accept certain government assistance programs 
we believe acceptance of these programs could enable our stores to service a growing portion of the us population 
our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars  in store marketing  television  email and online advertising 
much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers  principally through customer surveys and information gathered through our rewards program 
based on this information  we believe the majority of our core customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to purchase 
we believe value dominates decision making as our customers look to us for savings 
in  we made investments to improve our in store signage and merchandising displays  with a focus on our comparative pricing to competitors 
we expect to continue to develop these efforts in we continue to market to our buzz club members  by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores 
in  we launched our rewards program  which is our first true customer loyalty program  which we use to provide benefits to our customers 
after making the required number of qualifying purchases  the rewards member earns a coupon on their account for a future discount in our stores 
additionally  members may receive marketing information and other targeted promotional materials 
during  we began testing a new structure to our rewards program in select markets that would replace the current qualifying purchase system 
this pilot program utilizes targeted promotions  in lieu of the current qualifying purchase system  to attract customers to our stores and increase the average basket and frequency of transactions 
pending further testing and review  we expect to implement some variation of this new structure on a chain wide basis in the second half of 
table of contents from a marketing perspective in  there are four primary programs designed to continue to grow sales we use our printed advertising circulars and promotional pricing to create excitement surrounding the deals that we offer 
we use television commercials broadcast nationwide on both national and cable networks to promote our brand and  from time to time  promote items or special discounts in our stores 
our signage initiatives that focus on value and extreme price savings are also designed to continue our effort to reinforce our niche in low everyday price retailing 
the use of our rewards program is a key driver to furthering our focus on our core shoppers and expanding our customer base 
we believe the insights we are gaining from the pilot program of the new rewards structure will lead to more direct and focused promotions that positively influence the habits of our members 
at february   our rewards program membership totaled million members 
also  during  we intend to launch a new branding campaign under the tag lines of here the deal and big featured deal as our customer research has suggested a more favorable view of deals compared to prior marketing campaigns 
this new tag line will be prominent in our print  television and in store signage as well as our rewards materials 
from a store operations perspective  we began the company wide rollout of our ready for business program in the program focuses primarily on servicing our customers and creating operational efficiencies  based on certain performance criteria and standards centered on improving the consistency of visual presentation  merchandise recovery efforts  and overall store cleanliness 
ready for business also focuses on development of our field management team and improving our training programs  which we believe are very important to our store growth strategy 
as we have increased the number of our stores  we have been working to develop the depth of our field management team in order to internally promote and provide opportunities to qualified internal candidates who have a strong understanding of our business model 
we believe our focus on standards and investments in talent development have improved the performance of our new stores during their initial months of operation 
real estate we made a strategic decision to enter a store growth phase in  based on improvements in our store productivity  increased profitability at a consolidated level as a result of the win strategy and the softening of the real estate market  which provided a greater selection of locations at more advantageous lease costs 
since the beginning of  we have opened new stores  and closed stores  which has resulted in a net increase of stores  or approximately 
the commercial real estate market has been recovering in the past to months and therefore rents are not as favorable now as they were in   and in the early months of based on this trend  we have decided to moderate our store growth efforts in by opening approximately new stores  while closing an estimated stores 
in  we tested a store remodel program in stores in two geographic markets miami  florida and modesto  california 
based on the positive results of the initial testing of this remodel program  we have decided to expand the test program in to approximately additional locations in three separate markets within florida  california  and tennessee virginia 
as discussed in item properties  of this form k  we have store leases which will expire in during  we anticipate closing approximately of those locations 
the majority of these closings will be the result of our choice to relocate the store to an improved location nearby 
the balance of the closings will be the result of either a lack of renewal options or our belief that we can no longer generate an acceptable financial return in the location 
for our remaining store locations with fiscal lease expirations  we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate more favorable lease renewal terms sufficient enough to allow us to continue operations and achieve an acceptable return on our investment 

table of contents cost structure our goal each year is to continue to generate expense leverage lower expenses as a percent of net sales 
since  we have made several operational changes that have significantly contributed to the generation of expense leverage 
those operational changes include controlled inventory levels at our stores and regional distribution centers 
purchased and distributed merchandise to our stores in more optimal quantities and pack sizes to minimize handling in our distribution centers and stores 
timed receipt of merchandise in stores closer to the expected display dates in order to avoid excessive handling of merchandise 
increased the percentage of merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and pre packaged for efficient display and sale 
refined our staffing and payroll scheduling models in our stores 
invested in energy management systems to actively control utility costs  while reducing energy consumption 
implemented several initiatives which lowered our distribution and outbound transportation expenses  including re negotiating carrier contracts or changing carriers and determining the most optimal mix of carriers one way versus dedicated fleet 
tested and implemented lower levels of print advertising distribution in lieu of more cost effective email distribution 
in  we will continue to refine our activities  including those listed above  along with new initiatives to control costs in stores and our distribution centers 
additionally  the implementation of certain new systems will provide opportunity for future expense leverage 
canadian segment our canadian segment is focused on broadline closeout retailing and we have implemented merchandising strategies similar to those in our us segment 
from a merchandising perspective  our assortment is fairly similar to our us segment  while the percentage of each category varies based on seasonality  availability of product  and the demand of the canadian consumer 
we believe the merchandising categories of goods sold in our us segment have been core to our success  and consumers in canada are responding to our value proposition 
additionally  many of the vendors with whom we have strong relationships in the us also have canadian operations in need of an established closeout partner  therefore  we believe we have access to sufficient merchandise flow in order to execute our strategy 
during  we will be focused on continuing to improve merchandise quality and adjust merchandise mix based on consumer demand and testing  testing potential new marketing strategies and options  and introducing the big lots brand to canada by opening two to three new stores while also rebranding a small number of existing liquidation world or lw stores under the big lots name 
discontinued operations we continue to incur an insignificant amount of costs on the stores we closed in that are classified as discontinued operations 
we also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the kb toys business in discontinued operations 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations 

table of contents compared to us segment net sales net sales by merchandise category  in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to were as follows in thousands change furniture consumables home food seasonal electronics other hardlines toys net sales in the fourth quarter of  we realigned select merchandise categories to be consistent with the realignment of our merchandising team and changes to our management reporting 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we reported sales of our toys  books and sporting goods departments in the play n wear category 
we moved the toys  books and sporting goods departments out of the play n wear category and repositioned them in the hardlines other category 
we also moved the results of certain large closeout deals that are typically acquired through our alternate product sourcing operations out of the hardlines other category and repositioned them in the play n wear category 
we subsequently renamed our hardlines other category to hardlines toys and renamed our play n wear category to electronics other 
our consumables category was also separated into a food category and a consumables category 
the consumables category now contains our health and beauty care  housekeeping supplies  household chemicals  paper products  pet  and home organization departments  while the food category contains our various food and beverage departments 
fiscal and sales results have been reclassified to reflect this realignment 
net sales increased million or to  million in  compared to  million in net sales increased by million principally due to the net addition of stores since the end of and an additional week of sales  as was a week retail calendar year 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales  which reduced net sales by million 
our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least fifteen months 
the sales increase in the furniture category was driven by upholstery  mattresses  and case goods  partially offset by a decrease in ready to assemble furniture 
the consumables category experienced an increase in most departments  particularly the paper  household chemicals and housekeeping departments  which was partially offset by lagging health and beauty care sales 
the increase in sales of our home category was primarily due to growth in both the domestics and food preparation departments  offset by declines in most other home departments 
during  we allocated additional selling space in our stores to the home category in an effort to increase sales in this higher margin category 
this initiative did not meet our expectations and was a factor in certain management changes of this key category 
the food category experienced increases in nearly all departments as customers continue to respond to our new assortments and specialty offerings 
the seasonal category increase was driven by strong sales of our christmas trim assortment and moderate growth of our lawn garden and summer departments  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our fall seasonal departments 
the decrease in the electronics other category was primarily driven by lower sales in the apparel  lingerie and infant accessories departments as we allocated less space and reduced our assortments  which allowed for the space expansion in our home category 
these declines were partially offset by growth in jewelry and electronics  the latter of which benefited from a favorable response to our tablet computer offerings 
the decrease in the hardlines toys category was primarily driven by a decrease in our toys department  which was further downsized during  partially offset by an increase in the appliances department which benefited from an increase in branded closeouts in compared to for  we expect net sales to increase to  which is based on comparable store sales in the range of flat to an increase of 
growth rates of total sales will be impacted by one less week of selling in fiscal compared to 
table of contents gross margin gross margin dollars increased million or to  million in  compared to  million in the increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to an increase in net sales  which increased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
partially offsetting the increase was a lower gross margin rate  which decreased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points to in compared to in the gross margin rate decrease was principally due to a higher markdown rate and the million  or basis points  impact of the change in accounting principle related to the implementation of new retail inventory systems implemented at the beginning of for  we expect our gross margin rate to be slightly higher than  as we anticipate slightly lower levels of markdowns will be necessary to achieve our planned sales volume and the impact of the change in accounting principle in was a non recurring charge 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were  million in  compared to  million in the increase of million or was primarily due to increases in store occupancy expenses of million  store payroll expenses of million  health benefit expenses of million  corporate office payroll of million  and professional fees of million  partially offset by a decrease in share based compensation expense of million and lower bonus expenses of million 
the increase in store payroll and store occupancy expenses were primarily due to the net increase of stores compared to the end of the increase in health benefits expense was primarily driven by costs associated with certain large claims that were expensed during as compared to  a year in which we experienced few costs associated with large claims 
our corporate office payroll costs increased primarily due to the growth in our merchandising team and lower capitalization of salaries associated with information systems projects  as our sap implementation was completed at the end of the increase in professional fees was primarily driven by increased legal expenses related to pending litigation and other matters and consulting fees related to various on going information systems projects 
the decrease in share based compensation expense was primarily driven by the nonvested restricted stock award granted to mr 
fishman in in  the corporate financial goal associated with the award granted to mr 
fishman was achieved  while in  the corporate financial goal associated with the award granted to mr 
fishman in was not achieved 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  management changed its estimate of the vesting period for the restricted stock awards granted in and  exclusive of mr 
fishman grant  from three years to four years 
this change resulted in a decrease in share based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of the decrease in bonus expense was directly related to lower financial performance during as compared to the targets in our operating plan  most notably in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased by basis points to in compared to in as noted above  selling and administrative expense dollars increased primarily related to the increase in store count 
the primary driver of basis point deleverage in selling and administrative expenses was the decrease in comparable store sales performance  as the percentage increase in expense dollars was commensurate with the growth in store count 
our future selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales rate is dependent upon many factors including our level of net sales  our ability to implement additional efficiencies  principally in our store and distribution center operations  and fluctuating commodity prices  such as diesel fuel  which directly affects our outbound transportation cost 
for  we are forecasting an expense rate slightly higher than the rate achieved in store expenses  distribution and transportation expenses and advertising are expected to leverage as dollar growth in these areas is forecasted to be at a slower rate than our anticipated sales growth 
these leveraged expenses are expected to be offset by higher bonus expenses as we expect to achieve our corporate financial goals in depreciation expense depreciation expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is directly related to our new store growth  investments in systems  and capital spending to support and maintain our stores and distribution centers 
depreciation expense as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points compared to for  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million to million  which includes opening new stores 
using this assumption and the run rate of depreciation on our existing property and equipment  we expect depreciation expense to be in the range of million to million  which would represent an increase from the million of depreciation expense in

comparable store sales are estimated to increase in the range of to 
other performance factors interest expense interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily driven by increased borrowings in this increase was offset by decreases due to million of non recurring prepayment fees in the second quarter of that were associated with repayment of the notes payable assumed in the acquisition of big lots canada 
the increase was also offset by lower amortization of deferred bank fees on our credit agreement in as compared to deferred bank fees on our prior credit agreement in we had total average borrowings including capital leases of million in compared to total average borrowings of million in the increase in total average borrowings was primarily the result of our investment of million in to purchase approximately million of our outstanding shares under the and repurchase programs 
income taxes the effective income tax rate in and for income from continuing operations was and  respectively 
the higher rate in is primarily due to a valuation allowance relative to the deferred tax benefit of the loss generated by our canadian segment on a lower pretax income base and a net decrease in favorable discrete income tax items 
compared to us segment net sales net sales by merchandise category  in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage from compared to were as follows in thousands change furniture consumables home food seasonal electronics other hardlines toys net sales as discussed above in the section compared to  in the fourth quarter of  we realigned our merchandise categories in our us segment to be consistent with the realignment of our merchandising team and changes to our management reporting 
all results for and have been reclassified to represent the current merchandise category structure for comparability 

table of contents net sales increased million or to  million in  compared to  million in the increase in net sales was principally due to the net addition of stores since the end of  which increased net sales by million and a increase in comparable store sales  which increased net sales by million 
our comparable store sales were calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of the primary drivers of the sales increase in the furniture category were the upholstery and mattresses departments  partially offset by a decrease in case goods as benefited from a few large closeout deals 
the consumables and food categories experienced increases in nearly all departments as customers responded to our new assortments and specialty offerings 
the home category experienced growth in the domestics department  where new merchandising initiatives positively impacted sales throughout the majority of the year 
the growth in the domestics department was partially offset by comparable store sales declines in most other departments 
the seasonal category increase was driven by strong sales of christmas trim and summer related merchandise  partially offset by a decrease in our fall seasonal departments 
the decrease in the electronics other category was primarily driven by lower sales in the apparel departments  partially offset by an increase in the electronics department 
in addition  the electronics other category was impacted by the absence of certain drugstore closeout deals in we allocated less space and reduced our assortment of apparel during  and allocated a portion of this space to electronics based on customer demand 
the decrease in the hardlines toys category was driven by decreases in our toys  tools and paint departments as less selling square footage was allocated to these departments in as compared to gross margin gross margin dollars increased million or to  million in  compared to  in the increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to the increase in net sales which increased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
partially offsetting the increase in net sales was the decrease in gross margin rate which decreased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points to in compared to in the gross margin rate decrease was principally due to the unfavorable merchandise mix impact caused by the strong sales of our lower margin food and consumables categories and electronics department  lower initial mark up on merchandise receipts  and higher shrink costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were  million in  compared to  million in the increase of million or was primarily due to increases in rent expense of million  store payroll expense of million  advertising expense of million  and outbound transportation expense of million  partially offset by lower bonus expense of million 
store payroll and store rents increased primarily due to the net increase of stores compared to the end of the increase in advertising expense was driven by increased print distribution costs associated with new store growth  the roll out of new in store point of purchase presentations  and support for promotional events 
the increase in outbound transportation costs was largely driven by the net increase of stores along with higher diesel fuel prices 
the decrease in bonus expense was directly related to lower financial performance during as compared to the targets in our operating plan and to  which outperformed the targets in our operating plan 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased by basis points to in compared to in the decrease of was primarily due to the effect of the increase in sales of as selling and administrative expense dollars only increased as discussed above 
depreciation expense depreciation expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is directly related to our new store growth  investments in systems  and capital spending to support and maintain our stores and distribution centers 
depreciation expense as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points compared to canadian segment in  we consolidated the results of our canadian segment from the date of acquisition july  through the end of the fiscal year 
our canadian segment net sales were million  which exceeded our original expectations  as customers responded to fresh  new merchandise with an improved value proposition  particularly in furniture  electronics  toys  and christmas trim 
the higher than expected net sales resulted in a smaller than expected operating loss of million 

table of contents other performance factors interest expense interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to prepayment fees incurred in connection with our repayment of the notes payable we assumed in the acquisition of liquidation world inc we had total average borrowings including capital leases of million in compared to total average borrowings of million in borrowings increased as a result of our execution of the repurchase program and the acquisition of liquidation world inc income taxes the effective income tax rate in and for income from continuing operations was and  respectively 
the higher rate in is primarily due to a valuation allowance relative to the deferred tax benefit of the loss generated by our canadian segment  the effect of us income taxes on a lower pretax income base driven by the loss generated by our canadian segment and a net decrease in favorable discrete income tax items 
capital resources and liquidity on july   we entered into the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is scheduled to expire on july  in connection with our entry into the credit agreement  we paid bank fees and other expenses in the aggregate amount of million  which are being amortized over the term of the agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  working capital  and to repay certain of our indebtedness 
the credit agreement includes a million canadian swing loan sublimit  a million us swing loan sublimit  a million letter of credit sublimit and a million canadian revolving credit loan subfacility 
the interest rates  pricing and fees under the credit agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating 
the credit agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from multiple interest rate options 
the interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate  libor  or cdor 
we may prepay revolving loans made under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the credit agreement 
at february   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit agreement 
we use the credit agreement  as necessary  to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchase programs  and other expenditures 
in addition  we use the credit agreement to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements  a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs 
given the seasonality of our business  the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors  including our operating financial performance  the time of year  and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season 
the primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and  as necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume  seasonal sales patterns  and operating profit margins 
our net sales are typically highest during the nine week christmas selling season in our fourth fiscal quarter 
generally  our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we have typically funded those requirements with borrowings under our credit facility 
in  our total indebtedness outstanding borrowings and letters of credit peaked at approximately million in november 
at february   we had million in borrowings under the credit agreement and the borrowings available under the credit agreement were million  after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
we anticipate that total indebtedness under the credit agreement through june   will not exceed million  which includes our estimate of outstanding letters of credit and the estimated impact of cash needs of big lots canada 
working capital was million at february  whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the credit agreement  we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis 
the daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position  which is generally driven by the following components of our operations cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits  and cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise  wire and other electronic transactions for the acquisition of merchandise  payroll and other operating expenses  income and other taxes  employee benefits  and other miscellaneous disbursements 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in net income of million to million in from million in in addition  the decrease was impacted by growth in our inventories in comparison to our accounts payable  which resulted in a million use of cash 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million to million in from million in from an operational perspective  our accounts payable leverage ratio accounts payable divided by inventory remained relatively consistent at at february  compared to at january  our inventories increased as a result of our net store growth in the u 
s  increases in same store inventories in the us  and growth in the assortment of our canadian stores inventories 
cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a non recurring return of an million deposit with an insurance carrier in that caused an million cash flow change from to cash used in financing activities decreased by million to million in compared to million in the primary driver of the decrease in cash used in financing activities in and was a decrease in share repurchase activities of million 
in  we acquired million of our common shares million under the repurchase program and million under the repurchase program  as compared to the million of our common shares we acquired in million under the repurchase program and million under the repurchase program 
also contributing to the decrease was our increased receipt of proceeds from borrowings under our bank credit facility which accounts for million 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we used million to repay the outstanding notes payable we assumed in connection with our acquisition of liquidation world inc  driving a million change in cash flow from to in  we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  compared to million in the exercise of stock options also generated excess tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively 
based on historical and expected financial results  we believe that we have or  if necessary  have the ability to obtain  adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements  proposed capital expenditures  new projects  and currently maturing obligations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at february  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year to years to years years obligations under bank credit facility operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from the amounts actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges  or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under  or the automatic renewal of  contracts that provide for the same 

table of contents obligations under the bank credit facility consist of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  and the associated accrued interest of million 
in addition  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at february  approximately million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet the conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit  accordingly  they have been excluded from this table 
the remaining million of outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in the purchase obligations 
for a further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for retail stores  warehouse space  offices  and certain computer and other business equipment 
the future minimum commitments for retail store  office  and warehouse space operating leases are  million 
for a further discussion of leases  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
in connection with our store lease obligations  we estimated that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance were million at february  we have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to use of historical data to estimate our future obligations  calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data 
the remaining lease obligation of million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment  including data center related costs 
for purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  we included in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases 
purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at million  the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of february  in addition  we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling million at february  while we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment  we have included  for purposes of this tabular disclosure  the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation 
the remaining million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation  information technology  print advertising  energy procurement  and other store security  supply  and maintenance commitments 
other long term liabilities include million for obligations related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan  million for expected contributions to the pension plan and our nonqualified  unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan supplemental pension plan  million for unrecognized tax benefits  and million for closed store lease termination costs related to stores closed in pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans 
we have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions 
we have included unrecognized tax benefits of million for payments expected in and million of timing related income tax uncertainties anticipated to reverse in unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments 
our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms 
the obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities  guarantees  and indemnities related to the kb toys business 
for further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion of the kb bankruptcy lease obligations  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because the kb toys business filed for bankruptcy again in december and liquidated all of its store operations  we accrued a contingent liability on our balance sheet at january   in the amount of million for kb toys store leases for which we may have an indemnification or guarantee obligation and a former kb toys corporate office lease for which we took an assignment in at february   our contingent liability related to this matter was million 
because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability  our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  judgments  and assumptions  including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates  judgments  and assumptions on historical experience  current trends  and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates  judgments  and assumptions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies  including the recently adopted accounting standards and recent accounting standards future adoptions  if any  are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period 
the average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow moving inventory  the estimated allowance for shrinkage  and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin 
these estimates are based on historical experience and current information 
when management determines the saleability of merchandise inventories is diminished  markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  the age of merchandise  and seasonal trends 
timing of holidays within fiscal periods  weather  and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year 
the inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories  charged to cost of sales  and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period 
such estimates are based on both our current year and historical inventory results 
independent physical inventory counts are taken at each store once a year 
during calendar  the majority of these counts will occur between january and august 
as physical inventories are completed  actual results are recorded and new go forward shrink accrual rates are established based on individual store historical results 
thus  the shrink accrual rates will be adjusted throughout the january through august inventory cycle based on actual results 
at february   a difference in our shrink reserve would have affected gross margin  operating profit and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage 

table of contents long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment 
we perform annual impairment reviews of our long lived assets at the store level 
generally  all other property and equipment is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level 
when we perform the annual impairment reviews  we first determine which stores had impairment indicators present 
we use actual historical cash flows to determine which stores had negative cash flows within the past two years 
for each store with negative cash flows  we obtain future cash flow estimates based on operating performance estimates specific to each store s operations that are based on assumptions currently being used to develop our company level operating plans 
if the net book value of a store long lived assets is not recoverable through the expected future cash flows of the store  we estimate the fair value of the store assets and recognize an impairment charge for the excess net book value of the store long lived assets over their fair value 
the fair value of store assets is estimated based on information available in the marketplace for similar assets 
we recognized impairment charges of million and less than million in and  respectively 
we did not recognize an impairment charge in  related to our stores 
in our us segment  we identified two stores with impairment indicators as a result of our annual store impairment tests in one of these stores was closed by the end of for the other store  we recognized an impairment charge of million in we do not believe that varying the assumptions used to test for recoverability to estimate fair value of our long lived assets would have a material impact on the impairment charges we incurred in in our canadian segment  we identified four stores in our impairment review  which resulted in a fourth quarter impairment charge of million in if our future operating results decline significantly  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material for additional discussion of this risk  see item a 
risk factors a significant decline in our operating profit and taxable income may impair our ability to realize the value of our long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
in addition to our annual store impairment reviews  we evaluate our other long lived assets at each reporting period to determine whether impairment indicators are present 
in  we reviewed our operational needs surrounding travel and determined that we needed to replace an aircraft due in part to the repair costs and declining reliability of the aging aircraft 
as a result of this decision  we both purchased a new aircraft to meet our needs and placed an older aircraft in the market as available for sale 
we recorded a million impairment charge on the held for sale aircraft  based on market conditions at the time the decision was executed 
goodwill goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we used our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates were inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the second quarter of  which falls within the allowed measurement period  we recorded adjustments to goodwill in the amount of million 
these goodwill adjustments  associated with our acquisition of big lots canada  primarily related to fair value adjustments on our intangible assets and liabilities associated with the acquired operating leases 
the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  has since lapsed and we do not anticipate any subsequent adjustments  which would be recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
on an annual basis  we review our goodwill for potential impairment 
we conduct an impairment review which consists of preparing an estimate of the fair value of our reporting segments using an income approach and a market approach 
determining the fair value of a reporting segment involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our estimates of fair value on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we perform our annual impairment testing during our second fiscal quarter of each year 

table of contents share based compensation we grant stock options and performance based non vested restricted stock to our employees under shareholder approved incentive plans 
share based compensation expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
future share based compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock is dependent upon the future number of awards  fair value of our common shares on the grant date  and the estimated vesting period 
future share based compensation expense for stock options is dependent upon the number and terms of future stock option awards and many estimates  judgments and assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of stock options 
future share based compensation expense related to performance based non vested restricted stock and stock options may vary materially from the currently amortizing awards 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using a binomial model 
the binomial model takes into account estimates  assumptions  and judgments about our stock price volatility  our dividend yield rate  the risk free rate of return  the contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
expected volatility is based on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares and those of our peers 
the dividend yield rate on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury security yields at the time of the grant 
the expected life is determined from the application of the binomial model and includes assumptions such as the expected employee exercise behavior and our expected forfeiture rate  which is based on analysis of historical data 
compensation expense for performance based non vested restricted stock awards is recorded over the estimated vesting period based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria 
an estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures 
we monitor the achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense 
any change in the estimated vesting date results in a prospective change to the related expense by charging the remaining unamortized expense over the remaining expected vesting period at the date the estimate was changed 
income taxes the determination of our income tax expense  refunds receivable  income taxes payable  deferred tax assets and liabilities and financial statement recognition  de recognition and or measurement of uncertain tax benefits for positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex accounting and multi jurisdictional income tax laws 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss before income taxes  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the income tax laws which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year  subsequent recognition  de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent financial results  projected future pretax accounting income from continuing operations and tax planning strategies when necessary 
this evaluation requires us to make assumptions that require significant judgment about the forecasts of future pretax accounting income 
the assumptions that we use in this evaluation are consistent with the assumptions and estimates used to develop our consolidated operating financial plans 
if we determine that a portion of our deferred tax assets  which principally represent expected future deductions or benefits  are not likely to be realized  we recognize a valuation allowance for our estimate of these benefits which we believe are not likely recoverable 
additionally  changes in tax laws  apportionment of income for state and provincial tax purposes  and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets 

table of contents we evaluate the uncertainty of income tax positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns 
when a tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  we recognize economic benefits associated with the position on our consolidated financial statements 
the more likely than not recognition threshold is a positive assertion that an enterprise believes it is entitled to economic benefits associated with a tax position 
when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold  or in the case of those positions that do meet the threshold but are measured at less than the full benefit taken on the return  we recognize tax liabilities or de recognize tax assets  as the case may be 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have derecognized a tax benefit  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust unrecognized tax benefits and the income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively or ultimately settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or as a result of the evaluation of new information that becomes available 
pension actuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our pension plan and supplemental pension plan 
inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
we review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  we review rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plan asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate of return 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for was 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by million 
the long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in was 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
during  we reclassified million  net of tax  from other comprehensive income to expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we also recognized a benefit of million  net of tax  to other comprehensive income in  which was principally driven by the recognition of million pretax in settlement charges as participants elected more lump sum payments than originally estimated 
at february   the accumulated other comprehensive income amount associated with the plans  which was principally unrealized actuarial loss  was million loss  net of tax 
during  and in future periods  we expect to reclassify approximately million from other comprehensive income to expense  assuming we achieve our estimated rate of return on pension plan investments in future periods 
additionally  in the event that we have future settlements  as occurred in  and  we would expect that the pretax expense related to future settlements would be in the range of the million to million charges in and  respectively 
insurance and insurance related reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to property  general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical and dental benefit claims  a portion of which is funded by employees 
we purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity 
management makes estimates  judgments  and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations  including but not limited to  estimated health care cost trends  estimated lag time to report and pay claims  average cost per claim  network utilization rates  network discount rates  and other factors 
a change in our self insured liabilities at february  would have affected selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  using a discount rate  while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted 
a change in the discount rate on these liabilities would have affected selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 

table of contents lease accounting in order to recognize rent expense on our leases  we evaluate many factors to identify the lease term such as the contractual term of the lease  our assumed possession date of the property  renewal option periods  and the estimated value of leasehold improvement investments that we are required to make 
based on this evaluation  our lease term is typically the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property 
this term is used because although many of our leases have renewal options  we typically do not incur an economic or contractual penalty in the event of non renewal 
therefore  we typically use the initial minimum lease term for purposes of calculating straight line rent  amortizing deferred rent  and recognizing depreciation expense on our leasehold improvements 
commitments for a discussion on certain of our commitments  refer to note  note  note  and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
