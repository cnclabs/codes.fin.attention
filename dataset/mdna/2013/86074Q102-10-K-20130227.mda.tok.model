item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in part ii  item selected financial data 
overview the company reported full year consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share 
pgm prices in were lower on average than in  but still allowed the company to operate profitably in each quarter of the company operating performance was slightly better than its public guidance 
supply and demand fundamentals for palladium and platinum in  the company primary products  remain favorable from the company perspective  with significant constraints on worldwide supply growth in the face of steadily increasing demand  particularly from the automotive sector  and unrest in south africa 
the company continued its progress in strengthening its safety culture and in experienced its best annual safety performance ever 
the company customarily gives guidance at the beginning of each year with regard to anticipated annual mine production of palladium and platinum  total cash costs per ounce of palladium and platinum mined a non gaap measure described in more detail in part ii  item selected financial data of this report and capital outlay for the year 
actual mine production of palladium and platinum totaled  ounces  slightly better than the company guidance of  ounces  the higher production was mostly attributable to normal geologic variability within the mines 
total cash costs per ounce of palladium and platinum mined averaged per ounce for the year  better than the per ounce guidance  most of this favorable cost variance was driven by the higher than planned ounces produced during capital expenditures incurred in totaled million  less than the company initial guidance of million for the year  almost all of the under spending stemmed from expenditures deferred into on the marathon project in canada 
as previously disclosed  the company mine plans indicate production to be approximately  combined ounces of palladium and platinum 
more significant is the almost increase in total cash costs per mined ounce between the guidance of and the average of this projected cost growth is driven by the need to maintain and support the ever expanding depths and travel distances in the underground mines  by contractual wage increases and underlying inflation in materials costs  by the investment in training a large cadre of new miners to support future mine expansions  and to some extent by catching up for longer term maintenance issues deferred during the economic downturn in and in addition  the slightly lower estimated mine production also accounts for about per ounce of the cost increase 
capital outlay in is projected to total million  which is million above the million capital outlay in the capital outlay at the stillwater mine is projected to increase by million year on year  partially due to spending on the far west area  the kiruna haulage system and increased development activity and equipment 
east boulder mine capital spending is projected to increase by million from  due in part to increased infrastructure spending 
capital outlays on the blitz and graham creek expansion projects situated adjacent to the existing montana mines will continue in  with spending reduced by million year on year 
expansion of the columbus processing facilities  equipment additions and modifications are contributing factors to the projected increased capital spending in of million 
engineering and environmental work continues at marathon  with some of the deferred expenditures projected to occur in  contributing to a million year on year increase in capital spending 
subject to pgm prices during the year  the company expects to fund most of this capital outlay with cash generated from operations 
in millions plan outlay outlay capital outlay stillwater mine east boulder mine blitz graham creek processing and other total montana outlay marathon total capital outlay capital outlay excludes approximately million of anticipated non cash capitalized interest in capital outlay in excludes million of non cash capitalized interest 
no non cash capitalized interest was recorded in in october of  the company completed a million offering of new convertible debentures maturing in and first redeemable by the note holders in the intent of the fundraising was  first  to provide for the refinancing of the company million of convertible debentures redeemable by the holders on march   and second  for other corporate purposes 
the additional funding ensures that the company should have cash available to begin construction of the marathon pgm copper project in canada  assuming all approvals for that project will be secured 
the new financing leaves the company positioned with strong available liquidity at a time when many other companies in the pgm industry are struggling with steeply rising costs and associated liquidity concerns 
the company may require additional financing to complete the funding of its share of the marathon project 
that financing decision will be made at a future date and will depend on the company circumstances at that time 
company strategic priorities and funding considerations the company made appreciable progress during on all of its key strategic initiatives 
the first of these initiatives is designed to optimize the company existing operations  which includes giving primary attention to employee safety and environmental compliance  maintaining adequate developed state to sustain current production levels  ensuring that sufficient skilled manpower is available and properly trained  controlling capital and operating costs  and staying current regarding appropriate technological enhancements as they become available 
the company second key strategic initiative is to develop and strengthen key markets for the company principal products and in particular  for palladium 
this initiative generally has required both allocating some funding each year for image based advertising and carefully monitoring and encouraging newly emerging applications for pgms 
the company third key strategic initiative is profitable growth and diversification 
the company is involved in several significant growth projects that are intended to increase annual pgm production over the next several years 
this focus on growing the company annual production recognizes underlying supply and demand factors in the pgm market that the company believes portend stronger pgm pricing  and are of particular benefit to palladium 
optimizing the existing operations the company experienced excellent operating performance during it is generally true that  for mining and processing facilities  safety performance is a strong indicator of operating efficiency and effective labor relations 
the company normally assesses its mine safety performance not just against other us underground metals and non metal mining operations  but against all us metal and non metal mining operations  including surface mines and gravel pits 
these statistics exclude coal mines 
the company montana mines are already among the safest us underground metal and non metal mines  so this broader  more challenging safety universe seems a better target for safety improvement 
measured in terms of incidence reportable under msha regulations  the company mines had their safest year to date in during the company began implementing the national mining association new coresafety program  which is comprised of a series of modules designed to assist mining companies in meeting an aggressive set of longer term safety goals 
the company also continued its good environmental performance during all of the company mining and processing operations  including the smelter and base metals refinery  are designed to minimize any discharge of pollutants 
all water generated from the underground mines is biologically treated to remove any nitrates and then percolated into groundwater or land applied where it can be evaporated or utilized agronomically 
water at the company processing facilities tailings water is recirculated as process water 
trout fingerling tests in untreated tailings water typically show survival further demonstrating the benign nature of mine contact water 
waste rock from the mines  to the extent possible  is returned underground as fill material  the excess waste rock although not acid generating  may contain some residual nitrates from blasting that may be leached to groundwater 
best management practices bmp  land application and disposal lad and in some cases insitu biological treatment are utilized to minimize potential impacts to groundwater 
groundwater at both mines is compliant with standards and permit requirements at the property boundaries 
sulfur dioxide generated during processing is scrubbed and converted into gypsum  which is sold commercially for agricultural applications or water treatment 
the company also continues to work pro actively with local environmental non government organizations ngos through its contractual good neighbor agreement  which establishes a legal framework for constructive dialogue and information sharing between the company and its montana neighbors 
developed state refers to the portion of proven and probable ore reserves that are fully accessible and ready to mine at any point in time 
on the whole  an increase in the developed state of a mine provides more flexibility regarding areas to be mined and may permit higher production rates if adequate manpower and processing capacity are available 
because proven ore reserves in the company mines represent areas that are well defined geologically and for which an economically optimized mine plan is in place  total proven reserves are a good surrogate for measuring the company developed state 
on this basis  the developed state of the company montana mines improved during proven reserves at the stillwater mine increased to million in situ ounces of palladium and platinum from million in situ ounces at the end of similarly  at the east boulder mine proven reserves increased to million in situ ounces at december  from million ounces at the end of at a  ounce per year mining rate  that suggests the company has about months of developed state ahead of it as of december  that is the best developed state the company has enjoyed in its history 
needing to assure that in the future the company will have enough skilled miners available to offset normal workforce attrition and fully staff the mine expansion projects  the company has implemented an aggressive new miner training program 
during  about employees were hired into this program at the two montana mines 
the program provides an initial intensive training curriculum  followed by on the job training and mentoring by more experienced miners 
the program has generated intense local interest  with more applicants than the program can accommodate 
in the company experience  it typically takes three to five years for a new miner to reach full productivity  so training started now will come to fruition as the company current mine expansion projects come on line 
if this training program is able to provide enough new miners to go beyond just replacing normal employee attrition  then sufficient skilled manpower should be available to allow the company to increase its annual production rate as the expansion projects come into production 
in the meantime  the company will bear some additional labor costs as it invests in developing this future workforce 
although cost increases are significant in and  they are proceeding in accordance with plan 
the mines average total cash cost of per ounce a non gaap measure was about higher than the per ounce experienced in these higher costs were essentially in line with the mining plan for  and included the anticipated effect of expanding operations underground receding face  contractual wage increases and underlying inflation in materials costs  the investment represented by the new miner training program  and some catch up spending following the sharp cutbacks in and also  benefiting from higher pgm prices  the company has reduced its mining cutoff grades in some areas  taking lower grade ore that costs more to process but is profitable at current metals prices 
because a portion of the cost increases for represents investment to support future production growth  increased mine production over the next several years should partially mitigate this rate of cost increases 
from a broader perspective  if the company developed state is sufficiently robust  then during temporary down cycles in metals prices  some capital and operating costs can temporarily be scaled back in order to conserve cash 
ultimately  this deferred spending must be caught back up or production rates will suffer 
to some extent  capital and operating expenditures during and include additional maintenance and infrastructure spending to compensate for cutbacks during the economic downturn in and the cumulative annual growth rate in total cash costs per mined ounce for the six years from projected through  taking into account the economic downturn and subsequent recovery  averages about per year about what would be expected assuming low underlying inflation and taking the receding face issue into account 
other analyses of relative costs suggest that the company cost structure has become increasingly more competitive within the pgm industry over the past several years as competitor costs have escalated sharply 
in particular  industry analyses expressing cash costs on a platinum equivalent basis indicate that  with the strengthening of palladium prices relative to platinum over the past two years  the company operations are currently among the most cost competitive of all primary pgm producers 
analysis on a platinum equivalent basis purportedly levels out the effect of variation in product mix at different locations 
technology improvements generally have evolved slowly in the underground mining industry  but the company tries to take a proactive role in advancing such changes 
for example  the company was an early adopter of the use of biodiesel fuel blends underground to reduce employees exposure to airborne diesel particulate matter in the mine 
the company also has introduced large kiruna electric trucks underground to increase haulage efficiency and expand logistical capacity from the deeper parts of the stillwater mine 
currently  the company is working with a major equipment vendor to devise a low profile  tractor mounted rock drill sized to fit within conventional mining stopes  to be used by the miners in place of manually operated jackleg units 
the company expects to take delivery of two of these experimental prototypes during for testing in the mines 
developing and strengthening pgm markets the company first began an active market development program for palladium in late  at a time when palladium jewelry was first being introduced in china as a substitute metal for platinum and white gold 
in order to facilitate that shift toward palladium and establish it in the category of a precious metal  the company developed a set of technical sheets targeting bench jewelers and detailing how to work with palladium in crafting jewelry pieces 
these sheets were made available in several languages and widely distributed 
along with this effort  the company also sponsored image advertising for print material and television  again principally targeting the chinese market 
the intent of these efforts was to increase demand for palladium  thereby supporting its price 
subsequently  the company also broadened its focus  targeting european and north american jewelry markets  as well  and sponsoring various palladium centered events at major jewelry shows 
market development in the precious metals sector has traditionally been driven principally by the mining companies 
the larger pgm producers in south africa produce much more platinum than palladium and have an extensive cooperative marketing program that actively promotes platinum in jewelry and industrial applications  spending large sums each year supporting platinum around the world 
over the years this program has established platinum as the premier jewelry metal and was instrumental early on in securing platinum use in automotive catalytic converters 
because jewelry purchases are discretionary  the jewelry market for platinum has tended to utilize excess supplies of the metal during periods when industrial demand slackens and prices decline  reducing the effect of pricing cycles 
the gold industry has a similar cooperative marketing effort  although the dynamics of the gold market involve government inventories and therefore are different from platinum 
except for one smaller palladium producer in canada  the company is the only primary producer of palladium in the world 
acting mostly on its own  and with only limited resources  the company has attempted to provide some market support for palladium  both in the jewelry market and industrially 
while the company has attempted to assemble a cooperative effort among other pgm companies  to date it has remained essentially the only participant in this effort 
the company has extended its marketing efforts to include encouraging research into new palladium applications  but for the most part such efforts have adequate independent funding 
consequently  most of the company cash marketing expenditures have focused on building palladium image for the jewelry market 
the company continually monitors its jewelry marketing expenditures with a view toward adjusting its level of cash outlay as circumstances warrant 
as the market for palladium has tightened recently and prices have increased  the company will reassess whether such expenditures should be reduced  as jewelry demand would normally decline when prices increase 
although it is difficult to measure the direct effect of marketing expenditures on jewelry demand  the company tries to balance its level of marketing expenditures against the anticipated benefit to be derived from its marketing program 
profitable growth and diversification historically  the company financial performance and share price have been closely linked with the underlying price of palladium 
since  there have been two extended periods in which the market price of palladium dropped to levels which threatened the company economic viability 
the first of these periods  lasting from approximately through  led to a process through which norilsk nickel  a large russian nickel producer with important volumes of by product palladium  acquired about of the company in june  consummating the transaction with an infusion of cash and palladium metal 
norilsk nickel exited this investment in december the second downturn in the palladium price accompanied the most recent us recession and lasted from about mid until mid during that period  the company benefited from favorable palladium floor prices in its long term automotive supply contracts  the last of which expired at the end of the exposure to such extreme cyclicality resulting from the company primary dependence upon palladium led management to conclude that some measure of diversification into other metals would be prudent  depending on the opportunity and circumstances 
the company sole reliance on its montana mines  with essentially one primary product and only a single major market  was frequently cited by the rating agencies as comprising a high risk profile 
the expiration of the contractual pricing floors at the end of gave added urgency to addressing this concern  and in november the company purchased the marathon project  an attractive pgm development property in canada with a significant copper endowment 
once it is operational  this acquisition potentially will provide some geographic and product diversity while also further expanding the company core pgm business 
in october  the company completed the acquisition of peregrine metals ltd  an exploration company whose principal asset is the altar property  a discovery with significant copper and gold resource potential located in argentina 
beginning in the second half of  there appear to have been some structural changes emerging in the pgm markets  and particularly for palladium  that have led management to reassess its view of its pgm risk exposure 
the most important of these is the steep decline of exports into europe out of the russian federation strategic stockpiles of palladium 
the russian government does not officially comment on the status of these inventories  but there has been widespread speculation among observers that the russian stockpiles may be nearly depleted 
if so  this would mark a substantial change in the supply side dynamics of the palladium market 
between and  exports from the russian state inventories reportedly averaged over one million ounces of palladium per year  meeting between and of total market demand 
in addition  the widely publicized labor violence experienced in south african mines during appears to be symptomatic of significant challenges facing those operations 
in particular  the strong political opposition to closing uneconomic mines there has resulted in overproduction 
this excess supply in turn has driven pgm prices down to levels below many mines cost of production  resulting in a shortage of cash to reinvest in order to sustain production rates longer term 
while this is primarily an issue for platinum  to a lesser extent it also has repercussions for palladium 
norilsk nickel output of by product palladium has also been gradually declining over the past several years  although it is not clear whether this trend will continue indefinitely 
in the face of these substantial constraints on pgm supplies  demand for palladium and platinum continues to grow 
the largest market for both metals is in catalytic converters 
currently  palladium dominates the market for catalytic converters in gasoline vehicles  with some vehicles using no platinum at all  while platinum plays a key role in diesel catalytic converters 
the european auto market  which is about evenly split between gasoline and diesel  remains depressed  but robust vehicle production growth reportedly has continued in china and south asia  and north american vehicle production has now nearly returned to prerecession levels 
gasoline engines predominate in chinese and north american auto production 
with growing pgm demand and constrained supply  prices for both palladium and platinum are now at historically strong levels 
importantly  though  with the sharp reduction in russian government exports of palladium the historic steep discount in the price of palladium relative to platinum has narrowed substantially 
from through mid  the price of palladium typically averaged between and of the price of platinum  since the middle of it has averaged between and of the platinum price 
the company mines produce about times as much palladium and platinum  so this pricing realignment  together with relatively strong underlying pgm prices  has benefited the company 
in view of these changes in the pgm markets  the company emphasis has been shifting from a focus on diversification alternatives toward opportunities to benefit from strengthening pgm prices 
besides the marathon project in canada  management believes the blitz and graham creek projects situated adjacent to the existing montana operations  along with acceleration of the newly identified far west development within a previously undeveloped area of the stillwater mine  all provide opportunities for pgm production growth 
specifically  current plans indicate that the graham creek project should have first production in early  potentially adding about  ounces of incremental pgm production per year 
the far west development  which accelerates development in an area of the stillwater mine that in due course would have been mined anyway  is expected to come on line in mid  contributing about  added pgm ounces in and around ounces per year thereafter 
it is still too early to assess the definitive production opportunity at the blitz project  but the company believes that blitz might serve to replace depleting production out of the lower off shaft area at the stillwater mine and perhaps also add about  ounces of incremental production each year 
under current plans  no production is expected out of blitz before altogether  this suggests potential for about a increase in pgm production from the company montana mines over the next five or six years 
these growth projections are estimates  however  and there can be no assurance at this point that the company will have sufficient manpower or other resources to accomplish these targets 
funding notes at current pgm prices the company believes there should be sufficient cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand  to complete each of these pgm expansion projects of the far west  blitz and graham creek 
cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   totaled about million  taken together with highly liquid short term investments  available liquidity excluding undrawn capacity under existing credit lines was about million 
of this total  the company expects million to be utilized in redeeming the company outstanding convertible debentures on march  the remainder should be available for general corporate purposes  including support for capital projects if needed 
these december   cash and liquidity balances include about million of cash held in canada that is dedicated as funding for the marathon pgm copper project and other related properties and so is not available to the company for its general corporate purposes 
total cost to complete the current scope of the montana expansion projects  including blitz  graham creek and far west  will be about million over the next five or six years 
of this amount  nearly million has been spent through december  although  once they are completed  blitz and graham creek should each provide opportunities to increase the company annual pgm production 
these projects also should be considered as foundational or backbone developments that should provide access to undeveloped areas along the j m reef from which future mine development can be sourced 
at recent pgm price levels these capital projects  along with sustaining capital at the existing stillwater and east boulder mines  should be covered out of cash flow from operations 
the company most recent estimate of the cost to permit and construct the marathon project is between and million 
a detailed engineering study currently is under way which should provide firmer estimates later in with the sale of a interest in this project to mitsubishi corporation in early  the company remaining share of the capital would fall roughly between about million and million 
some of the cash on hand could be used to fund the initial construction spending at marathon  but management expects to seek additional project debt financing to support this effort in conjunction with its joint venture partner 
in addition to the convertible debentures expected to be redeemed on march   the company has in place million of convertible debentures that are first redeemable in september  million of state of montana industrial revenue bonds due in july  and a million asset backed line of credit expiring in december with approximately million of available borrowing base at december  consequently  management believes the company currently has adequate liquidity and  aside from the debentures noted previously  no significant debt maturing in the near future 
status of company projects the company growth projects all progressed on several fronts during at the blitz project  located adjacent to the company stillwater mine  a newly acquired tbm was received and assembled underground during  and it began operating in december 
the blitz tbm is a factory reconditioned machine that is feet long  with a new ton cutter head that is feet in diameter and when in operation rotates about six times per minute 
meanwhile  development of a second parallel drift along the j m reef about feet above the tbm is also under way using conventional drill and blast development methods 
both drifts are planned to extend underground about  feet to the east of the existing stillwater mine infrastructure 
permitting is in progress on a new surface portal situated about four miles to the east of the stillwater mine surface facilities 
a proposed decline ramp originating from this new portal would intersect the new drifts  providing ventilation and emergency egress for the entire blitz area 
just over million remains to be incurred on completing the blitz development over the next five or six years 
at the graham creek project  through the end of  the existing tbm has developed about  feet of new underground footwall lateral extending to the west of the east boulder mine 
the tbm is expected to complete its planned  feet of development during the second quarter of at that point  the company will begin developing two new ventilation raises in support of future graham creek operations 
first production from graham creek is expected in early and has the potential to add about  pgm ounces per year to east boulder mine production 
estimated capital expenditures remaining to complete the present scope of this project total about million 
the company identified an area within the envelope of the stillwater mine where development could be accelerated to provide some production growth ahead of the production timeline for the blitz project 
this area  known as the far west  is located about three miles to the west of the mine shaft and is underneath the upper west area of the mine  which has been mined for many years 
development drifts have only accessed this area within the past year or two  and ore appears to be a little higher grade there than in the upper west with good ore yields 
developing this area may pull some manpower away from the blitz project for a time but should not significantly delay blitz development 
this project represents an acceleration of development in the far west area pulling forward capital that would have otherwise been spent in later years 
cost to develop the far west area is approximately million spread over about three years 
the company marathon project  near the town of marathon at the northern tip of lake superior in the province of ontario  canada is progressing through the stages of final engineering and environmental review 
the company disclosed previously that in the course of the final engineering  it identified some problems with the palladium grades reported in the earlier feasibility study prepared for this project 
the proven and probable ore reserves cannot be updated until the economic evaluation of the project in the final engineering study is completed 
planned cost of the marathon project in is about million 
on the environmental front  earlier in the company submitted an environmental assessment to the joint federal provincial marathon review panel for consideration 
following a comment period  the study has been returned with various comments and questions  some of which have entailed additional data gathering 
the company expects to resubmit the updated documentation during the first half of the company also is engaged in discussions with various first nations and other aboriginal groups potentially affected by the proposed project 
assuming all issues are resolved in a timely manner  construction of a mine at marathon might begin in late  with first production likely in early in october of  the company completed the acquisition of peregrine metals ltd  whose principal asset is the altar copper gold porphyry exploration project in the san juan province of argentina 
this property was acquired with the intent of providing the opportunity to engage in longer term product diversification 
on the basis of definitional drilling to date  the altar property geologically appears to be exceptional 
drilling there has substantially expanded the boundaries of the resource  to the extent that it appears likely any mine development there would be significantly larger than originally envisioned 
it is important to note that at this point there are no proven and probable reserves at altar  as establishing such reserves requires completing a feasibility study to assess the associated project economics 
in view of the continuing improvement in the pgm markets in and early and taking into consideration the increased political uncertainty in argentina  the company has been cautious in its evaluation of the altar project 
the company completed its drilling and evaluation program for about million  less than the million originally planned 
the company has further reduced its exploration and general and administrative budget at altar in to about million 
the company continues to believe that the altar asset represents significant long term potential and also believes it would be unwise to make a definitive statement about its future at this time or to otherwise terminate the project 
the company intends to keep its spending at modest levels for the foreseeable future in order to gain a better gauge on its prospects and ultimate value 
in the view of management  the altar investment represents a valuable option 
the company recognizes that construction of a mine at altar would be expensive and also recognizes that value may be realized in many ways  including through partnering or the sale of all or a portion of the project 
as the company projects in montana and at marathon come on stream in the years ahead  the company should have a better reading on altar and its future in general at that time 
other capital projects include somewhat higher than normal spending on sustaining capital at the existing montana mines 
stillwater mine spending will include extending the ramp underground for the kiruna electric truck haulage system and procuring a third kiruna truck 
the far west incremental development cost  estimated at million in  is also included in the stillwater mine capital  as is the purchase of some additional underground haulage equipment 
the processing and recycling facilities will replace the very old and unreliable gypsum thickener tank  as well as finishing up the slag cleaning facilities at the smelter furnace 
principal factors affecting the company the mile long surface exposure of the j m reef which the company controls represents a relatively small and upwardly displaced portion of the stillwater intrusive complex  a much larger geologic feature that extends at substantial depth for several miles northward from the beartooth front where the company mines are located 
when the beartooth mountains were formed during the rocky mountain uplift laramide orogeny about million years ago  the southern most edge of the stillwater complex was detached and tilted steeply upward from the larger feature  exposing the generally north dipping and pgm rich j m reef near the current mountain front 
the pgm reef resource that the company has developed and mined thus far has averaged about five feet in width 
the company has accessed approximately miles of the total mile exposure and up to one mile of its vertical extent 
the palladium dominant pgm ores in the j m reef have some of the highest pgm grades in the world  which contributes to a comparatively low mining cost per ounce 
however  the narrow mining widths resulting from the steeply dipping configuration of the reef make the deposit relatively complex to mine 
the company mines compete primarily with the platinum rich pgm ore reserves within south africa bushveld complex and with the significant pgm by products from the primary nickel mines controlled by norilsk nickel in northern russia 
the platinum dominant bushveld pgm deposits typically dip more gradually to depth in comparison to the j m reef 
however  over time the near surface bushveld ores have been depleted  and the remaining underground resources are subject to deeper  hotter and more complex mining conditions  which generally results in comparatively higher mining costs per ounce 
the russian nickel mines of norilsk nickel produce palladium rich pgms as a major by product of their primary nickel operations and so at a very low marginal cost 
other global sources of pgms with which the company competes include the great dike in zimbabwe  the predominantly nickel copper operations of vale and xstrata at sudbury in canada  and north american palladium operations at lac des iles  also in canada 
the company financial performance relative to its peers depends not only on the level of pgm prices  but also on the differential between the price of platinum and the price of palladium 
in periods of low pgm prices  and in particular when palladium prices also are low relative to platinum prices  the company palladium rich production may put it at a disadvantage to comparable mines in south africa with a higher proportion of platinum in their ores 
see risk factors the company may be competitively disadvantaged as a primary pgm producer with a preponderance of palladium with a us dollar based cost structure for further discussion 
the stillwater mine  one of the company two montana mining operations  is situated about road miles to the southwest of columbus near the town of nye and accesses the eastern portion of the j m reef 
the mine principal horizontal haulage levels extend both to the east and to the west from the mineshaft 
the mine ore concentrating facilities and offices are located on the surface adjacent to the shaft  at an elevation of  feet above sea level in the stillwater valley 
the portions of the mine developed below the valley elevation are accessed by a system of internal ramps and via the  foot vertical shaft that extends to the mine level 
the stillwater mine commenced operations years ago in and to date has developed portions of the reef along about six horizontal miles on various levels underground  ranging from about the level at the deepest up to the level in the upper west area of the mine 
typically  the lower portion of the stillwater mine that is accessed from the shaft referred to as the off shaft area has produced relatively high average ore grades  however  mineable ore zones in this area tend to exhibit lower continuity of grade and thickness along the reef 
by contrast  the western portion of the mine above the level the upper west area generally has somewhat lower average ore grades  but the ore continuity  grade and thickness in this area is relatively consistent along the reef 
consequently  overall ounce production at the stillwater mine  is sensitive not only to the total ore tons produced  but also varies from period to period as a result of the relative proportion of total ore produced from each area as production advances systematically 
in  the stillwater mine produced  ounces of pgms down from  ounces in and generated sales revenues of million 
at december   the stillwater mine had employees  including miners 
the company other montana mine  the east boulder mine  is located on the western portion of the j m reef about miles south of big timber 
the mine surface facilities are within the boundaries of the gallatin national forest  and access into the mine is provided by two parallel  foot horizontal rail adits that intersect the reef perpendicularly at the  foot elevation deep within the mountain 
the mine was commissioned in  and to date has developed along about horizontal miles of the j m reef underground 
mining operations have been developed vertically between elevations of  and  feet above sea level 
the continuity of grade and thickness in the pgm mineralization at east boulder is characteristically higher than that observed at the stillwater mine 
however  average ore grades at east boulder are lower  with grades to the mill typically averaging between and ounces per ton 
during  the east boulder mine produced  ounces of pgms compared to  ounces in with sales revenue of million 
at december   the east boulder mine had employees  including miners 
the company recycles spent catalyst materials through its processing facilities situated along interstate in columbus  montana  recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
recycling materials are weighed and sampled  and then are commingled with concentrates produced at the two mines and fed into the columbus smelter and base metals refinery 
recycling has proven to be a consistently profitable ancillary activity 
however  the recycling business has also proven to be very sensitive to pgm prices volumes of recycling material available in the market drop very sharply when pgm prices decline  as does the overall profitability of the business 
the company believes it enjoys certain competitive advantages in the recycling business 
the smelting and refining complex in columbus  montana processes concentrates from the montana mines  which contain not only pgms  but also significant quantities of nickel and copper as by products which are key to efficient recovery of pgms from recycled materials 
copper and nickel sulfides from the ore concentrates bind with the elemental pgms from recycling in the smelter and so aid in collecting the recycled pgms 
because of this affinity  the company is able to recycle catalyst material within its system at an incremental cost lower than most other processors 
moreover  the company also believes the physical location of its processing facilities provides a logistical advantage over smelters in europe and south africa  particularly for north american collectors 
and as described below  the company employs certain technological innovations that may contribute further to its competitive advantage 
the company has taken steps over the past several years to reposition itself in the recycling business 
in may  the company commissioned a new electric furnace in the columbus smelter  increasing throughput capacity and creating backup furnace capacity in the event of planned or unforeseen outages 
during the third quarter of  the company commissioned a dedicated catalyst processing and sampling plant that allows for the segregation and handling of multiple batches of recycling material simultaneously 
in early  the company commissioned a new state of the art assay laboratory which utilizes an automated x ray facility that provides accurate results with faster turnaround times than conventional fire assay methods 
new laboratory software supports this automated x ray system  as well as other laboratory processes 
and in late  the company completed the reconfiguration of its former primary smelting furnace  providing a new slag cleaning circuit in the smelter that should improve pgm recoveries from the feed stream 
in acquiring recycled automotive catalysts  the company advances certain funds to its suppliers ahead of actually receiving material in order to facilitate procurement efforts 
in general  the company only advances funds to suppliers when the associated material for recycling is awaiting transit or is already in transit to the columbus processing facilities 
the state of the art recycling  sampling and assay facilities allow the company to accelerate final settlements with suppliers  thereby allowing them to turn over their working capital faster 
outstanding procurement advances that were not backed up by inventory physically in the company s possession totaled million at december   and million at december  following the collapse in most metal prices during the second half of  platinum and palladium market prices gradually recovered during and generally trended up during most of and early the us dollar strengthened and prices for both metals were lower during the second half of and declined further in mid before recovering in the fourth quarter 
the price of platinum at year end in london was  per ounce and palladium ended at per ounce 
pgm prices have been closely correlated with the ratio of the us dollar to the euro in recent years  and they declined beginning in august of in response to european economic uncertainty and associated strengthening of the us dollar 
much of also was characterized by a relatively strong dollar  as european investors in particular sought out the relative safety of the us dollar in the face of european economic uncertainty 
palladium and platinum prices have risen further in early on investor perceptions of impending shortages in both metals 
see looking forward platinum and palladium price history another factor that has influenced pgm prices in recent years has been the introduction of pgm exchange traded funds etfs into the us market 
these were first introduced in january the etfs have proven to be a popular investment vehicle  although they may have the effect of increasing price volatility in the pgm markets 
experience suggests that the trading in the platinum etf tends to be relatively stable in the face of changes in metal prices  while trading in the palladium etf is much more responsive to pricing changes 
for example  volumes held by palladium etfs increased over the course of  driving prices higher by increasing the total demand for palladium while supply was constrained 
however  after peaking at million ounces in february of  just before the devastating tsunami hit japan  etf holdings of palladium saw substantial liquidation  declining to about million total ounces over the remainder of the year 
this etf liquidation arguably exacerbated the decline in the palladium price over that period as etf volumes were sold 
the year saw some renewed buying interest in the etfs for both metals 
pgm markets inherently carry certain inherent risks 
compared to other precious metals and major industrial metals  pgm trading volumes normally are relatively thin and their markets have limited liquidity 
consequently  pgm prices historically have been volatile and difficult to forecast 
pgm prices may be affected favorably or unfavorably by numerous factors  including the level of industrial demand  particularly from the automotive sector  by supply factors that include changes in mine production and inventory activity  and by general shifts in investor sentiment 
in particular  although exports from the russian government inventories appear to have slowed in recent years and according to some are nearing depletion  the russian federation does not officially disclose its inventory holdings and there is no sure way to verify that those inventories are actually approaching exhaustion 
recent pgm prices have been comparatively high by historical standards  and to some extent these price levels are likely affected by investor sentiment that could shift away from precious metals if other markets become more attractive  interest rates rise or prices edge downward 
the company attempts to manage this market volatility in several ways  including by aggressively marketing palladium  by entering into long term supply agreements  in some limited cases through metal hedging  by investing to maintain and strengthen the developed state of the mines  and by monitoring the company liquidity closely to maintain the financial capacity to bridge periods when pgm prices are low 
automotive demand has continued to strengthen in most major markets since after its steep decline during the recession in late and total worldwide production of light vehicles in reportedly was at record levels 
according to a mitsui report issued in early  north american car production in grew by to million vehicles  only slightly below pre recession levels 
and in a year when economic activity in china was viewed as constrained  automobile production there grew by to million units 
the other bric countries overall also saw growth during the european auto market remains severely depressed  however 
continued growth in worldwide auto demand  coupled with ever more stringent emissions regulations and increasing palladium penetration into diesel catalytic converters  have continued to drive the growing market demand for palladium 
worldwide mine production of palladium and platinum  which had declined since peaking in  suffered a further decline during as labor unrest in south africa shut down mine production for a time at properties owned by each of the major producers 
russian production also declined during johnson matthey s november interim report  which included data available through september  projected platinum ounces supplied to market including recycling would decline to million ounces in from million ounces in palladium ounces supplied to market including recycling and russian inventory sales also reportedly were projected to decline to million ounces in from million ounces in for the same period  johnson matthey projected that palladium usage in catalytic converters would grow by to million ounces  while platinum usage in catalytic converters would remain essentially flat at about million ounces 
of continuing concern in the pgm industry is the lack of an adequate level of reinvestment in the business 
a few smaller companies  principally in south africa  have invested in developing new mines  and impala has some major new shafts under way  but the amount of new production they are expected to generate will not be sufficient over the longer term to sustain current production levels 
putting in a large new underground mine on the bushveld complex in south africa reportedly requires an investment of more than a billion dollars in a new shaft and the entire process from conception to production can take ten years or more 
although current pgm prices may seem comparatively robust in us dollars  rising operating costs and an adverse strong exchange rate for the south african rand have limited the benefit of higher metal prices to south african producers 
as a result  they have difficulty justifying the kinds of new mining investments that need to be made 
when coupled with other challenges in south africa  including labor unrest  political opposition to idling uneconomic operations  safety issues  power shortages  rapidly escalating wage structures  political uncertainty on several fronts  and a critical shortage of experienced professionals  the outlook for adequate future reinvestment there is troubling 
results and commentary for the full year  the company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per fully diluted share  a decrease from the million  or per diluted share  reported for and slight increase from the million  or per diluted share earned in after an exceptionally strong year in  realized prices for palladium and platinum were generally lower during  reflecting a stronger dollar and surplus metal inventories during much of the year 
in september of  with the threat of a greek default overhanging the market and driving down the value of the euro  commodity prices generally fell off sharply and remained lower for the balance of and most of the company average realized price on sales of mined palladium and platinum was per ounce in  lower than the per ounce average realized in the company s mine production of palladium and platinum totaled  ounces in  a decrease of compared to  ounces in this lower mine production in relative to was primarily attributable to normal geological variation within the mines 
revenues from mining including by product revenues  in totaled million  down from million in  on the weaker realized prices and lower sales volumes in stillwater mine s total cash costs a non gaap measure averaged per ounce for the full year  an increase of above the per ounce actually realized in the year on year increase is attributable to inflation in labor and materials costs  additional hiring under the new miner training program and for infrastructure support  and the impact on operations of the continually expanding mining profile underground 
produced ounces of palladium and platinum produced at the stillwater mine decreased to  ounces in from  ounces produced in  which also affected total cash costs per ounce 
capital outlay at the stillwater mine totaled million in including million for the blitz project  ahead of the million spent during of which million was for blitz  reflecting the replacement of some dated mining equipment 
primary development at the stillwater mine  which includes extensions of footwall laterals and ramps  advanced about  feet during  about less than planned 
secondary development  which includes sills developed within the reef and ramps used for direct access into specific mining stopes  advanced about  feet  less than planned 
diamond drilling footages in at the stillwater mine totaled about  feet  less than planned 
despite the lower development and drilling footages  the mine expanded its base of proven reserves during total cash costs per ounce at the east boulder mine in averaged per ounce  lower than planned and higher than the per ounce averaged in as with the stillwater mine  the year on year difference is attributable to increased labor and materials costs  along with the costs associated with the new miner training program and normal expansion as the mining faces recede 
mine production at east boulder increased to  produced ounces of palladium and platinum in  up compared to  ounces produced in capital outlay at the east boulder mine totaled million in including million at graham creek compared to the million spent in actual primary development at the east boulder mine advanced about  feet and secondary development  feet in  in total slightly above plan 
the overall development footage at the east boulder mine was about ahead of plan  largely reflecting good progress on the graham creek tbm advance 
diamond drilling footage totaled about  feet at the east boulder mine in  about less than planned 
the company is party to a three year palladium supply agreement with general motors expiring at the end of and a one year platinum supply agreement with tiffany co  and also has a month to month agreement with ford motor company and one year supply agreements with johnson matthey and basf 
these agreements typically provide for pricing at a small discount to a trailing market price  although such discounts have become less common recently 
for  the company mine production of palladium is essentially fully committed 
the company sells the remaining uncommitted share of its mined platinum under month to month agreements and in the spot market 
the company s smelter and base metal refinery in columbus  montana process the pgm ore concentrates from the two mines and also recycles spent pgm catalysts from automotive catalytic converters and from other industrial applications  ultimately recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
during  the company fed about  combined ounces of recycled palladium  platinum and rhodium into the smelter  of which about was from material purchased directly by the company and the remainder was toll processed on behalf of others for a fee 
total ounces fed to the smelter during  reflected a decrease of compared to the  recycling ounces fed in receipts of recycling material strengthened during the fourth quarter as pgm prices firmed  this strength has continued into early recycling revenues in were million on  combined ounces sold  in recycling revenues totaled million on sales of  combined ounces 
in  the company recycling operations earned million pre tax reflecting a combined average realization including rhodium of  per sold ounce 
by comparison  in the company recycling operations contributed million pre tax to income  with a combined average realization of  per sold ounce 
total tons of recycling material processed during  including tolled material  averaged tons per day  down from the tons per day in weaker pgm prices in created less of an incentive for suppliers to collect recycling material 
however  during  the company was able to enter into new sourcing arrangements for catalyst material with several new suppliers 
the company s consolidated total available liquidity  expressed as cash and cash equivalents plus short term investments  ended at million  comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available for sale investments 
this balance included the net proceeds of the company million offering of convertible debentures in october the corresponding year end balance was million  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available for sale investments 
cash generated from operations during totaled million  down from million in  driven mostly by the lower pgm prices in the company did not incur any new debt in  although at the end of the company put in place a million asset backed revolving credit facility 
at the end of  the company s montana workforce totaled  employees  an increase of for the year from  in december about of the net manpower increase was attributable to adding new production and maintenance staff at the mines  including hiring for the new miner training program 
the remainder of the increase was spread evenly over all other functions 
worldwide  the company had  employees at december  compared to  at december  the company s environmental performance continued its excellent track record during environmental compliance is a very high priority 
the company has a record of open communication and cooperative  proactive involvement with its neighbors and with local and regional environmental groups 
the company operating permits require that  in conjunction with its mining and processing activities  it must provide adequate financial surety in support of its permit obligations to complete final reclamation and remediation once mining operations cease 
as of december   the company had outstanding approximately million of surety bonds mostly in favor of state and federal agencies to guarantee final reclamation and other commitments 
regulatory authorities are currently in the midst of updating an environmental impact statement eis on the montana properties  which when finalized will determine whether or not the existing surety amounts are sufficient 
upon completion of this review process  it is likely that the company will be required to provide additional surety bond coverage 
as of december   the company had posted cash and letters of credit totaling million to collateralize its surety obligations 
social considerations although  like other publicly traded companies the company primarily seeks to maximize the value it generates for shareholders over time  management believes that ultimately meeting the expectations of all its stakeholders is essential to accomplishing that objective 
thus  the company environmental approach reflects its operational integrity  its product awareness  as pgms are used to clean the environment  and its location sensitivity  given the pristine areas in which the company operations are located 
because the company operates in some exceptionally pristine locations and produces products that are essential to preserving air quality  careful attention to environmental performance and feedback is critical to and consistent with the company continuing operations as well as to its favorable reputation 
the company is a key employer in the communities where it operates  and actively supports the communities where its employees and their families live allowing the company to attract highly qualified individuals to these communities 
attractive wages and benefits  coupled with a safe work environment  not only allow the company to be competitive in the market for employees  but also contribute to the health and economic vigor of the communities where it operates 
investment in state of the art facilities and technologies allows the company to continually deliver high quality products to its customers at a competitive price 
the company approach to the environment is somewhat unique in the mining industry 
the good neighbor agreement  originally signed in and now in its thirteenth year  commits the company to work closely with and provide full disclosure to its neighbors and certain regional environmental ngos 
provisions of the agreement include transporting the majority of employees to and from work in buses so as to minimize traffic on rural roads  quarterly meetings among the parties to the agreement to discuss concerns and consider environmental performance  ongoing company funding of an independent engineering firm to monitor and report on the company environmental records  and open community involvement in company dealings with regulatory agencies 
in addition  the company has traditionally hosted an annual dinner where the environmental community can meet directly with the company board of directors 
the company processes overall are designed to minimize their impact on the environment  complying with and in most cases exceeding all applicable regulatory standards 
about of the mined tailings typically are returned to the mine after processing and are used as fill 
the remaining tailings are placed in lined tailings ponds where much of the constructed embankments have been re vegetated and contoured to try to match the surrounding topography 
tailings are environmentally inert and are not acid generating 
water from the mines generally meets drinking water standards aside from elevated concentrations of nitrates from the explosives used underground 
these nitrates are treated and removed biologically before any water is discharged 
tailings water is recycled through lined facilities back to the concentrators and not discharged to the environment 
regardless  bioassay of tailings water shows survival of trout fingerlings in periodic tests 
biodiesel blends are used as fuel underground  both for their cleaner exhaust and to reduce carbon footprint 
likewise  in an area noted for its abundance of deer  elk and bear  the stillwater mine also hosts a large herd of bighorn sheep that winter on the mine property and can be regular visitors to the mine parking lot 
the smelter and refinery in columbus  montana both use closed loop processes with almost zero fugitive emissions 
the smelter is fully scrubbed virtually eliminating so emissions the facility emitted of its permitted annual level in while the scrubbers produce synthetic gypsum calcium sulfate which is licensed for use by farmers as a soil amendment and for water treatment 
stack emissions are monitored continuously and critical processes can be shut down automatically if so emissions were to exceed permitted levels 
however  emissions have yet to exceed such levels 
particulate dust in the scrubber stream is filtered using gore tex membranes and returned to the smelter 
all process water on the property is ultimately consumed  emitted as steam or evaporated 
storm water is segregated from contact with process materials and routed to infiltration galleries 
slag from the smelter is cooled and recycled back to the mines for reprocessing 
the company has recently modified one of the smelter furnaces for slag cleaning  which should increase pgm recoveries 
the health  safety and environmental committee of the company board of directors meets regularly to review the company performance in these key areas 
its charter includes mandates i to review the company environmental and occupational health and safety policies and programs  ii to oversee its environmental and occupational health and safety performance  and iii to monitor current and future regulatory issues 
with regard to employee health  the company medical benefits include a wellness program for employees and their families intended to encourage and educate regarding good health practices 
the program includes annual physical checkups  targeted programs for specific health risks  and themes related to physical  emotional and mental health issues 
on the safety front  the company has engineered safe practices into all work tasks and trains to those standards 
the company continually works to establish and maintain a multifaceted culture of safety  summarized by the slogan  everyone goes home safe every day 
safety programs include incidence tracking and analysis  near miss reporting  workplace start of shift inspection checklists  team safety meetings  annual refresher training  safety stand downs and financial incentives for working safely 
the company also works closely with msha inspectors to act on their findings and incorporate their suggestions 
recently  the company has begun to implement the new national mining association coresafety program  which is comprised of separate modules addressing all aspects of mining safety 
management also strives to maintain a consistent tone at the top that gives working safely priority over all other objectives 
while the company plans are still in the early stages at marathon and altar  management intends to implement these key health  safety and environmental principles and practices for its employees and future operations internationally 
one early step being taken is the effort to establish early on an effective working relationship with the local communities and environmental agencies in the vicinity of these new properties 
experience suggests that building the mutual confidence and trust that such relationships require takes time and patience 
however  the company history in montana suggests that any effort to develop these projects without fully taking into account the concerns of all the affected stakeholders would create delays and be unnecessarily confrontational and expensive 
in light of the environmental protection agency efforts to regulate carbon dioxide co emissions as a greenhouse gas  the company has reassessed its exposure to likely restrictions on such emissions 
the company principal sources of co emissions are limited to a comparatively few internal combustion engines in vehicles and mining equipment  and to stationary sources such as mine ventilation and process heaters  dryers and converters that consume natural gas 
as noted above  the company already utilizes buses to transport its workforce to and from the mines and utilizes a blend of biodiesel fuels in its operations which reduces workplace diesel particulate matter emissions and its carbon footprint 
consequently  any taxes or added restrictions on emissions are unlikely to have any direct material effect on the company operations 
the company physical exposure to climate change is minimal 
the company operations are not materially dependent upon weather patterns or seasonal availability of water 
the relatively remote location of the mines presents some exposure to severe weather  particularly winter snowfall that can restrict access to the mine sites  but the company already regularly addresses this issue during the winter months in montana 
similarly  smoke from summer wildfires can temporarily restrict access to the mines  but their duration tends to be relatively short 
probably the company most significant exposure to greenhouse gas regulation is the potential effects of a substantial longer term movement away from internal combustion engines on the demand for pgms in catalytic converters 
such a major shift in automotive demand could depress pgm prices and impair the company financial performance 
regulatory constraints on other industries also could affect the price or availability of electricity and other materials necessary for mining  potentially driving up the company operating costs 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues the company s total revenues  including proceeds from the sale of by products  totaled million in  a decrease of compared to revenues of million in this year on year decrease in total revenues reflects lower pgm prices in as compared to  as well as lower mine sales volumes in revenues from mine production totaled million in including million from by products  a decrease of compared to million in of which million was from by products

liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
mining productivity rates and ore grades in turn can affect both pgm production and cash costs of production 
net cash flow from operations also includes changes in non cash working capital  including changes to inventories and advances 
at december  and  the company s available balance of cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid short term investments excluding restricted cash was million and million  respectively  and it reported million of debt outstanding at december   and million of debt outstanding at december  available cash and cash equivalents at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
in addition to available cash and short term securities  the company also has access to a million asset backed revolving credit facility 
the amount available to be drawn under this facility is restricted by a contractual borrowing base computation 
to date this line has been utilized only to collateralize irrevocable letters of credit 
cash drawings under this credit line bear interest at a spread over libor  the spread varies according to a matrix depending on the amount of utilization under the line 
letters of credit and the unused facility balance bear interest at specified fixed rates 
as of december   the company remaining availability under the borrowing base was approximately million 
the company  at interest rate levels prevailing at december   will be required to fund approximately million in total interest payments during related to its outstanding debt obligations 
the company million of outstanding senior convertible debentures are redeemable at par at the discretion of the holders on march  the company expects all of these outstanding debentures to be redeemed at that time 
in december of  standard and poor upgraded the company debt rating from b to b  citing improved market conditions and adequate liquidity 
in july  moody investors service upgraded the company corporate family rating from caa to b with a stable outlook 
these represent the company current corporate ratings 
both moody investors service and standard and poor had downgraded the company corporate credit rating during as economic conditions deteriorated 
at issue had been the company strong dependence on its automotive agreements  lack of geographic or product diversity  metal market price volatility  and difficult cost structure 
the company s financial performance is affected by changes in pgm prices 
absent separate hedging arrangements  any change in the price of palladium or platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
at the forecasted mine production level of  combined pgm ounces  a one dollar change in the price of platinum would affect annual cash generated from mining operations by about million  and a corresponding change in the price of palladium would affect annual cash generation from mining operations by about million 
the sensitivity of the recycling business to changes in palladium and platinum prices is more muted and varies according to the provisions in the various recycling agreements 
in the company s recycling activities  upon purchasing recycled material for processing the company simultaneously enters into a fixed forward contract that determines the future selling price of the contained pgms  effectively locking in a sales margin 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  during the third quarter of  the company revised its cash management guidelines to extend the available investment maturities on a portion of its cash balances  broaden the suite of permissible investments  and adjust the percentage limits on certain classes of investments 
as a result  during most of the company s cash holdings were transferred into short term investments 
as of december   all of these short term investments remain highly liquid  but technically they no longer meet the strict definition of cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities primarily represent capital outlay and net sales and purchases of short term investments 
capital expenditures totaled million  adjusted to include incurred but unpaid obligations at the end of million and million in  and  respectively 
the company also expended million along with million shares of company common stock with a fair value upon issuance of million in and million in cash along with million shares of company common stock with a fair value of million in to acquire equity interests in exploration companies and properties 
no such acquisitions were made in all significant company wide repair and maintenance costs in connection with planned major maintenance activities are expensed as incurred 
the company does not accrue in advance for major maintenance activities  but  when practicable  tries to disclose in advance in its public filings any planned major maintenance activities that may affect operations 
net cash provided by or used in financing activities equaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
convertible debentures in march  the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due in debentures 
the debentures pay interest at per annum  payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing september  the debentures will mature on march   subject to earlier repurchase or conversion 
each  principal amount of debentures is initially convertible  at the option of the holders  into approximately shares of the company common stock  at any time prior to the maturity date 
the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments  but will not be adjusted for accrued interest or any unpaid interest 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
the company may redeem the debentures for cash at any time on or after march  the debentures were sold to an accredited investor within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  in reliance upon the private placement exemption afforded by section of the securities act 
the initial investor offered and resold the debentures to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act 
in october  the company undertook the exchange of million face amount of the convertible debentures for million shares of the company common stock 
because the number of shares issued in this transaction exceeded the shares per  of face value specified in the bond indenture  accounting principles required that the company expense the value of the excess shares as an inducement loss 
consequently  the company recorded a loss on the exchange transaction of million during the fourth quarter of the debentures so acquired have been retired  leaving million face value of the debentures outstanding at december  the outstanding million of convertible debentures will reach their date of first call on march  absent a significant change in the share price of the company  the company believes most holders are likely to redeem their debentures at par  or should the share price be at or above the conversion price  convert them into company shares 
if the debentures were to all convert  the company would be required to issue about million new shares of common stock 
convertible debentures in october  the company completed the issuance of million of senior unsecured convertible debentures  due october  each  principal amount of these new debentures is initially convertible  under certain circumstances and during certain periods  into shares subject to customary anti dilution adjustments of the company common stock  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the debentures also include an embedded conversion enhancement feature that is equivalent to including with each debenture a warrant initially exercisable for shares initially at per share both subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
the company  at its election  may settle conversions of the debentures in cash  shares of its common stock or any combination of cash and shares of its common stock 
debenture holders have the right to redeem their debentures at face value plus accrued and unpaid interest  to  but excluding  the relevant repurchase date on october of each of    and upon the occurrence of certain corporate events 
the company will have the right to call the debentures at any time on or after october  the debentures were bifurcated under us gaap into separate debt and equity components  and reflect an effective maturity to the first optional redemption date of seven years 
the residual amount recorded within equity is treated for accounting purposes as additional debt discount and accreted as an additional non cash interest charge to earnings over the expected life 
debt and equity issuance costs totaling about million were deducted from the gross proceeds of the offering and the debt portion is being amortized ratably over months 
net proceeds of the offering will be used to retire the company million of outstanding convertible debentures upon their expected redemption in march of  and for general corporate purposes 
amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and interest expense related to the issuance of the senior unsecured convertible debentures was million and million  respectively  for the period ending december  the company made no cash payments of interest for the period ending december  asset backed revolving credit facility in december  the company entered into a million asset backed revolving credit agreement with wells fargo capital finance  incurring initial debt issuance costs of million 
maximum permitted borrowings under this working capital facility at any time are determined by a borrowing base comprised of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
terms of the agreement state that the borrowings will be secured primarily by the company accounts receivable  metals inventories and other accounts 
the credit agreement includes a financial covenant requiring  whenever the remaining availability under the line is less than of the total borrowing capacity  that the company fixed charge coverage ratio be at least to it also includes other customary restrictions that become tighter as drawings under the facility increase 
the facility includes a million letter of credit sub facility 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a spread over the london interbank offer rate that varies from to  decreasing progressively as the percentage drawn against the facility increases 
the company also pays an unused line fee on committed but unutilized commitments under the facility at a rate per annum of or  depending on utilization of the facility 
on january   the company completed the syndication of this facility to a group of four banks and simultaneously expanded the maximum line of credit to million  incurring additional debt issuance costs of million 
at december   the company s remaining availability under the borrowing base was approximately million

the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies production measurement the company s production levels for palladium and platinum are driven by the number of ore tons mined  the mill head grade of the ore and the metallurgical recovery percentages 
the company measures its net mine production in terms of the number of ounces contained in the mill concentrate  adjusted for subsequent processing losses expected to be incurred in smelting and refining 
the company defines an ounce of metal as produced at the time it is transferred from the mine and received at the concentrator 
depletion  depreciation and amortization costs are inventoried at each stage of production 
mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving adits and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground ore body and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the ore body  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate for each relevant geological area within a mine is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs and the related ore reserves associated with that area 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related development assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit  resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
the company s method of accounting for development costs is as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine  the initial development at the east boulder mine  general mine development and tailings impoundments are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in ore grades or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 
asset impairment the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the estimation of future cash flows takes into account estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices long term sales contract prices and historical pricing trends or third party projections of future prices rather than prices at a point in time as an indicator of longer term future prices  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a determination of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions such as pgm prices  lower than expected recoverable ounces  and or the company operating performance could have a material effect on the company determination of ore reserves  or its ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  resulting in potential additional impairment charges 
costs incurred to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
the company assesses  at least quarterly  whether there has been any event or change in circumstances that might indicate that the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property  plant and equipment  if any  may not be recoverable out of expected future cash flows and estimated salvage value 
if so  the company then determines if these costs are in excess of their net undiscounted realizable value and  should that be the case  reduces the carrying value of the respective assets to their fair value 
foreign currency transaction with the acquisitions in and of certain canadian and south american assets  the company now regularly incurs capital and operating expenditures denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has determined that the functional currency for its subsidiaries is the us dollar and therefore reflects all assets  liabilities and expenditures in us dollars for accounting purposes 
the company uses a monthly average exchange rate for converting minor foreign currency expenditures into us dollars  and uses the actual exchange rate incurred in accounting for larger transactions 
for balance sheet purposes  monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are recorded based on the exchange rate at the end of the respective period 
any net accounting difference that results from exchange rate differences is recorded as a foreign exchange gain or loss for the relevant period on the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes with the acquisitions in and of certain canadian and south american assets  the company now is subject to federal and provincial income taxes on its canadian activities and federal income taxes on its south american activities as well as being subject to us state and federal income taxes 
income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred taxes associated with the company canadian and south american activities are recorded using the assumption that future earnings and profits associated with these activities will not be repatriated into the us but will be fully utilized in canada and south america 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december  and  for the portion of the company net deferred tax assets and certain credits for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
post closure reclamation costs the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the timing and amount of future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially affect the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december  and  and determined no corresponding adjustment was required at december  and see note asset retirement obligation to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
derivative instruments the company from time to time may enter into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forward sales  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forward sales to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company revenue 
derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
in the future the company may also enter into foreign currency hedges to stabilize costs incurred in foreign currencies 
the company at times has entered into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices  interest rates and foreign currencies as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company has entered into long term agreements with suppliers and customers  from time to time has employed various derivative financial instruments and attempts to maintain adequate liquidity to sustain operations during a downturn in pgm prices 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company customarily enters into fixed forward sales and from time to time in the past has entered into financially settled forward sales transactions that may or may not be accounted for as cash flow hedges to mitigate the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities 
under these fixed forward transactions  typically metals contained in the spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are purchased and then are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
the company believes such transactions qualify for the exception to hedge accounting treatment provided for in the accounting literature and so has elected to account for these transactions as normal purchases and normal sales 
financially settled forward sales provide a mechanism to offset fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production in those circumstances where the company elects to retain control of the final disposition of the metal 
in financially settled forward sales  the parties agree in advance to a net financial settlement in the future based on the difference between the market price of the metal on the settlement date and a forward price set at inception 
consequently  at the settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
no metal changes hands between the parties in these financially settled transactions 
the company generally has accounted for financially settled forward transactions as cash flow hedges  as they are not eligible for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
however  if the company determines not to document them as cash flow hedges  these transactions are marked to market in each accounting period and the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
as of december  and  the company was not party to any financially settled forward agreements 
periodically  the company also has entered into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses on such transactions therefore are recognized in net income in each period 
interest rate risk and investment risk at december   all of the company outstanding long term debt was subject to fixed rates of interest 
interest income on payments to the company recycling suppliers is generally linked to short term inter bank rates 
undrawn letters of credit issued under the company revolving credit facility carry a fixed contractual rate of interest  although any cash drawings against the facility would be subject to a floating interest rate 
there were no such drawings outstanding as of december  and the company convertible debentures and industrial revenue bonds do not contain financial covenants  other than change in control protection and  in the case of the convertible debentures  investor make whole provisions 
the company asset backed revolving credit facility includes a single fixed charge coverage covenant that only takes effect when less than of the total borrowing capacity under the line remains available 
because there were no drawings under the revolving credit facility at december   the company is not constrained by conventional financial covenants at this time 
with the recent issue of the million convertible debentures  the company has a higher level of indebtedness  which could affect the company ability to pay the principal of and interest on the notes and its creditworthiness in general 
the company may from time to time invest excess cash balances in short term instruments 
recent market conditions affecting certain types of short term investments of some issuers as well as certain financial institutions have resulted in heightened risk in holding some of these investments 
there can be no guarantee that further market disruptions affecting various short term investments or the potential failure of financial institutions will not have a negative effect on the price and liquidity of investments made by the company 
foreign currency risk with the acquisition of the marathon assets in canada in  the company first gained some modest exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
similarly  the peregrine acquisition in has created further exposure to canadian  argentine and other foreign currencies 
while these exposures currently are limited to foreign cash deposits and expenses incurred for the services of a few foreign based employees and contractors  along with some associated support costs  as the company foreign commitments expand in the future  the exposure will become more material 
the company does not generally hedge this exposure at present  but may consider doing so in the future as the scale of its foreign operations grows 
the company is exposed to a significant inflation rate in its holdings of argentine pesos 
during  the company recorded a foreign currency transaction gain of million on deferred taxes recorded in association with the acquisition of peregrine metals ltd 
the gain was a result of the strengthening of the us dollar in comparison with the argentine peso 
as the deferred taxes will be settled at a future date in pesos  changes in the relative currency values are recognized in the period within foreign currency transaction gain loss on the company consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company does not generally hedge this exposure at present  but may consider doing so in the future as the scale of its foreign operations grows
