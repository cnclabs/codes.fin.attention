item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of global partners lp should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of global partners lp and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview general we are one of the largest distributors of gasoline including gasoline blendstocks such as ethanol and naphtha  distillates such as home heating oil  diesel and kerosene  residual oil and renewable fuels to wholesalers  retailers and commercial customers in the new england states and new york 
we are a major multi brand gasoline distributor and have a portfolio of approximately  owned  leased and or supplied gasoline stations primarily in the northeast 
we are a leader in the logistics of transporting and marketing crude oil and other products from the mid continent region of the united states and canada to the east coast and  commencing february  the west coast see items and business and properties recent developments for a further discussion 
we are also a distributor of natural gas 
we purchase refined petroleum products  renewable fuels and crude oil primarily from domestic and foreign refiners and ethanol producers  crude oil producers  major and independent oil companies and trading companies  and we sell these products in three reporting segments i wholesale  ii gasoline distribution and station operations and iii commercial which are discussed below 
collectively  we sold approximately billion of refined petroleum products  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas for the year ended december  in addition  we had other revenues of approximately million  primarily from convenience store sales at our directly operated stores and gasoline station rental income 
as of december   we owned  leased or maintained dedicated storage facilities at refined petroleum product bulk terminals  each with the capacity of more than  barrels  including located throughout the northeast  that are supplied primarily by marine transport  pipeline  rail and or truck and that collectively have approximately million barrels of storage capacity 
additionally  we have storage capacity at our albany  new york terminal to store crude oil and at select locations to store renewable fuels 
in columbus  north dakota we constructed a  barrel tank and truck offloading facility as part of the development of a hub for the gathering  storage  rail transloading  transportation and marketing of crude oil and other products 
we also have throughput and exchange agreements at numerous bulk terminals and inland storage facilities 
in addition  we have storage agreements at several of our terminals granting storage rights to third parties for which we receive a fee 
like most independent marketers  we base our pricing on spot prices  fixed prices or indexed prices and routinely use the nymex  cme and ice or other counterparties to hedge the risk inherent in buying and selling commodities 
through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations 
wholesale we own  control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products and renewable fuels in the northeast 
we also engage in the logistics of gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of refined petroleum products  renewable fuels and crude oil 
our strategically located terminal assets  logistics capabilities  transloading facilities and access to railroad and barge transportation provide a virtual pipeline solution for the transportation of crude oil  renewable fuels and other products from the mid continent region of the united states and canada to the east and west coasts 
gasoline distribution and station operations as of december   we had a portfolio of approximately  owned  leased and or supplied gasoline stations primarily in the northeast 

table of contents in september  we completed the acquisition from exxonmobil corporation of retail gasoline stations  together with the rights to i supply mobil branded fuel to those stations as well as an additional existing locations in massachusetts  new hampshire and rhode island  and ii expand supply opportunities for mobil branded and exxon branded fuel in certain other new england states 
this acquisition expanded our wholesale supply business and added vertical integration to our transportation fuel business in new england 
on march   we acquired alliance  a gasoline distributor and operator of gasoline stations and convenience stores 
as of the date of the acquisition  alliance portfolio included approximately gasoline stations in the northeast  of which it owned or held under long term lease approximately stations  and had supply contracts for the remaining stations 
the alliance acquisition expanded our geographic footprint for gasoline stations to include connecticut  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  maine and vermont 
alliance is a top tier distributor of multiple brands  including exxon  mobil  shell  sunoco  citgo and gulf 
prior to the closing of the acquisition  alliance was wholly owned by ae holdings which is approximately owned by members of the slifka family 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on april   we entered into an agreement with getty realty to supply and provide management services to more than of its gasoline stations in new york and new jersey 
on november   we signed a long term lease agreement with getty realty for approximately of those sites  which enables us to supply gasoline to and operate gasoline stations in the new york city boroughs of queens  manhattan and the bronx as well as in long island and westchester county 
the lease with getty realty significantly expands our retail gasoline and fuel distribution presence in the new york metro region 
commercial this segment includes sales and deliveries to end user customers in the public sector and to commercial and industrial end users of unbranded gasoline  home heating oil  diesel  kerosene  residual oil  renewable fuels and natural gas 
our commercial segment also includes sales of custom blended distillates and residual oil delivered by barge or from a terminal dock to ships through bunkering activity 
products and operational structure our products primarily include gasoline  distillates  residual oil  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas 
we sell gasoline to branded and unbranded gasoline stations and other resellers of transportation fuels  as well as to customers in the public sector 
the distillates we sell are used primarily for fuel for trucks and off road construction equipment and for space heating of residential and commercial buildings 
we receive and move crude oil by rail from the mid continent region of the united states and canada to the east coast and  as of february  the west coast and sell it to refiners 
we sell residual oil to major housing units  such as public housing authorities  colleges and hospitals and large industrial facilities that use processed steam in their manufacturing processes 
in addition  we sell bunker fuel  which we can custom blend  to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets 
we sell our natural gas to end users 
we have increased our sales in the non weather sensitive components of our business  such as transportation fuels  however  we are still subject to the impact that warmer weather conditions may have on our home heating oil and residual oil sales 
due to the nature of our business and our customers reliance  in part  on consumer travel and spending patterns  we may experience more demand for gasoline and gasoline blendstocks during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter 
travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate  increasing the demand for gasoline and gasoline blendstocks that we distribute 
therefore  our volumes in gasoline and gasoline blendstocks are typically higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year 
as demand for some of our refined petroleum products  specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes  is generally greater during the winter months  heating oil and residual oil sales are generally higher during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
these factors may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
generally  our wholesale customers use their own vehicles or contract carriers to take delivery of the gasoline and distillate products at bulk terminals and inland storage facilities that we own or control or with which we have throughput or exchange arrangements 
our crude oil is aggregated by truck or pipeline in the mid continent  transported on land by train and shipped to refineries on the east coast in barges 
ethanol is shipped primarily by rail and by barge 
for our commercial customers  we generally arrange the delivery of the product to the customer designated location  typically hiring third party common carriers to deliver the product 

table of contents for several reasons  including the size of the alliance acquisition  our strategic focus on gasoline distribution and station operations which increased in significance with the alliance acquisition  changes to our organizational structure of this operating segment under one divisional president  and how performance is reviewed and decisions are made  we determined that we have three operating segments 
commencing with the quarter ended march   our three operating segments  which are also our reporting segments  are the following wholesale 
this reportable segment includes sales of unbranded gasoline including gasoline blendstocks such as ethanol and naphtha and diesel to unbranded gasoline customers and other resellers of transportation fuels 
we sell home heating oil  diesel  kerosene and residual oil to home heating oil retailers and wholesale distributors 
we also sell crude oil to refiners 
gasoline distribution and station operations 
this reportable segment includes sales of branded and unbranded gasoline to gasoline stations and other sub jobbers 
this segment also includes gasoline  convenience store  car wash and other ancillary sales at our directly operated stores  as well as rental income from dealer leased gas stations 
commercial 
this reportable segment includes sales and deliveries to end user customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial end users of unbranded gasoline  home heating oil  diesel  kerosene  residual oil  renewable fuels and natural gas 
in the case of commercial and industrial end user customers  we sell our products primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms 
this segment also includes sales of custom blended fuels delivered by barges or from a terminal dock to ships through bunkering activity 
for years ended december   and  the commercial operating segment did not meet the quantitative metrics for disclosure as a reportable segment on a stand alone basis 
however  we have elected to present segment disclosures for the commercial operating segment as we believe such disclosures are meaningful to the user of our financial information 
outlook this section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future  both in the short term and in the long term 
our results of operations and financial condition depend  in part  upon the following our business is influenced by the overall forward market for refined petroleum products  renewable fuels and crude oil  and increases and or decreases in the prices of these products may adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders and the amount of borrowing available for working capital under our credit agreement results from our purchasing  storing  terminalling  transporting and selling operations are influenced by prices for these products  pricing volatility and the market for such products 
prices in the overall forward market for these products may affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
our margins can be significantly impacted by the forward product pricing curve  often referred to as the futures market 
we typically hedge our exposure to petroleum product and renewable fuel price moves with futures contracts and  to a lesser extent  swaps 
in markets where futures prices are higher than current prices  referred to as contango  we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current market for delivery to customers at higher prices in the future 
in markets where futures prices are lower than current prices  referred to as backwardation  inventories can depreciate in value and hedging costs are more expensive 
for this reason  we attempt to reduce our inventories in order to minimize these effects 
when prices for the products we sell rise  some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase supply from us at their historical purchase volumes  and their customers  in turn  may adopt conservation measures which reduce consumption  thereby reducing demand for product 
furthermore  when prices increase rapidly and dramatically  we may be unable to promptly pass our additional costs on to our customers  resulting in lower margins for us which could adversely affect our results of operations 
higher prices for the products we sell may diminish our access to trade credit support and or cause it to become more expensive and decrease the amount of borrowings available for working capital under our credit agreement as a result of total available commitments  borrowing base limitations and advance rates thereunder 
when prices for the products we sell decline  our exposure to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers of our forward contracts may be increased as they and or their customers may breach their contracts and purchase the products we sell at the then lower retail market price 
a significant decrease in the price for crude oil could adversely affect the economics of the domestic crude oil production for the product which  in turn  could have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales 

table of contents we commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions  although there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers of terminalling  storage  logistics and or marketing assets  including gasoline stations  and related businesses 
our growth largely depends on our ability to make accretive acquisitions 
we may be unable to make such accretive acquisitions for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts  we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or we are outbid by competitors 
in addition  we may consummate acquisitions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive but that ultimately may not be accretive 
if any of these events were to occur  our future growth would be limited 
we can give no assurance that our acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms that are favorable to us 
the condition of credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity 
in the recent past  world financial markets experienced a severe reduction in the availability of credit 
possible negative impacts in the future could include a decrease in the availability of borrowings under our credit agreement  increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts and our contractual counterparties requiring us to provide collateral 
in addition  we could experience a tightening of trade credit from our suppliers 
we depend upon rail and marine transportation services for a substantial portion of our logistics business in transporting the products we sell 
a disruption in rail and marine transportation services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
hurricanes  flooding and other severe weather conditions could cause a disruption in rail and marine transportation services that could affect the flow of service 
in addition  labor disputes between the railroads and their union employees and labor renegotiations  or a work stoppage at railroads  could also disrupt rail service 
these events could result in service disruptions and increased cost which could also adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
other disruptions  such as those due to an act of terrorism or war  could also adversely affect our business 
our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks financial results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
due to the nature of our business and our customers reliance  in part  on consumer travel and spending patterns  we may experience more demand for gasoline and gasoline blendstocks during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter 
travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate  increasing the demand for gasoline and gasoline blendstocks that we distribute 
therefore  our results of operations in gasoline and gasoline blendstocks are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
our heating oil and residual oil financial results are seasonal and generally lower in the second and third quarters of the calendar year 
demand for some refined petroleum products  specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes  is generally higher during november through march than during april through october 
we obtain a significant portion of these sales during the winter months 
therefore  our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally better than for the second and third quarters 

table of contents warmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and residual oil 
because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter  warmer than normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in the northeast can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales 
energy efficiency  higher prices  new technology and alternative fuels could reduce demand for our products 
increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil 
consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades 
we could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government mandated controls or regulation further promoting the use of cleaner fuels 
end users who are dual fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas 
other end users may elect to convert to natural gas 
during a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas  dual fuel customers may switch and other end users may convert to natural gas 
during periods of increasing home heating oil prices relative to the price of natural gas  residential users of home heating oil may also convert to natural gas 
such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
in addition  higher prices and new technologies and alternative fuel sources  such as electric  hybrid or battery powered motor vehicles  could reduce the demand for gasoline and adversely impact our gasoline sales 
a reduction in gasoline sales could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
changes in government usage mandates and tax credits could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol  which could negatively impact our gasoline sales 
future demand for ethanol will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline and ethanol  taking into consideration the epa regulations on the renewable fuels standard rfs program and oxygenate blending requirements 
a reduction or waiver of the rfs mandate or oxygenate blending requirements could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol  which in turn could adversely affect our future gasoline and ethanol sales 
new  stricter environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regulating product quality specifications and other environmental matters 
the trend in environmental regulation is towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time 
our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations 
we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
however  there can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith 
results of operations evaluating our results of operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include net product margin  gross profit  ebitda  distributable cash flow  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  operating expenses  net income per diluted limited partner unit and degree day 

table of contents net product margin we view net product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review net product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
we define net product margin as our sales minus product costs 
sales primarily include sales of unbranded and branded gasoline  distillates  residual oil  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas  as well as convenience store sales and gasoline station rental income 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale as well as product costs related to convenience store items 
we also look at net product margin on a per unit basis net product margin divided by volume 
net product margin is a non gaap financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements to assess our business 
net product margin should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our net product margin may not be comparable to net product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies 
gross profit we define gross profit as our sales minus product costs and terminal and gasoline station related depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales 
sales primarily include sales of unbranded and branded gasoline  distillates  residual oil  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas and all associated costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts  to assess our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements  our financial performance without regard to financing methods  capital structure  income taxes or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners  our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale  marketing  storing and distribution of refined petroleum products  renewable fuels and crude oil  without regard to financing methods and capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  and this measure may vary among other companies 
therefore  ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
distributable cash flow distributable cash flow is an important non gaap financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment 
distributable cash flow means our net income plus depreciation and amortization minus maintenance capital expenditures  as well as adjustments to eliminate items approved by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner that are extraordinary or non recurring in nature and that would otherwise increase distributable cash flow 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we have generated sufficient earnings on a current or historic level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distribution 
distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a expenses include  among other things  marketing costs  corporate overhead  employee salaries and benefits  pension and k plan expenses  discretionary bonuses  non interest financing costs  professional fees and information technology expenses 
employee related expenses including employee salaries  discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes  benefits  and pension and k plan expenses are paid by our general partner which  in turn  is reimbursed for these expenses by us 
operating expenses operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals and gasoline stations used in our business 
lease payments and storage expenses  maintenance and repair  utilities  taxes  labor and labor related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our system but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
net income per diluted limited partner unit we use net income per diluted limited partner unit to measure our financial performance on a per unit basis 
net income per diluted limited partner unit is defined as net income  divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted common units  or limited partner units  during the period 
degree day a degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption 
degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of f 
each degree of temperature above f is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below f is counted as one heating degree day 
degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long term multi year average  or normal  to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual 
degree days are officially observed by the national weather service and officially archived by the national climatic data center 
for purposes of evaluating our results of operations  we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the national weather service at its logan international airport station in boston  massachusetts 
years ended december   and significant activities during  we continued to expand our gasoline distribution and station operations segment 
on march   we acquired alliance  a gasoline distributor and operator of gasoline stations and convenience stores 
as of the date of the acquisition  alliance portfolio included approximately gasoline stations in the northeast  of which it owned or held under long term lease approximately stations  and had supply contracts for the remaining stations 
the alliance acquisition expanded our geographic footprint for gasoline stations to include connecticut  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  maine and vermont 
alliance is a top tier distributor of multiple brands  including exxon  mobil  shell  sunoco  citgo and gulf 
on april   we entered into an agreement with getty realty to supply and provide management services to more than of its gasoline stations in new york and new jersey 
on november   we signed a long term lease agreement with getty realty for approximately of those sites to supply and operate gasoline station in the new york city boroughs of queens  manhattan and the bronx as well as in long island and westchester county 
the initial lease term for the locations is years and includes multiple five year renewal options 
the lease with getty realty significantly expands our retail gasoline and fuel distribution presence in the new york metro region 

table of contents in our wholesale segment  we continued our expansion into crude oil logistics  including the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil 
we completed construction on our new  barrel tank and truck offloading facility in columbus  north dakota as part of the development of that location as a hub for the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil and other products 
in addition  in albany  new york  we completed a build out project that increased rail receipts and throughput storage capacities of ethanol and crude oil and converted certain storage tanks for the handling of crude oil 
this expansion increased our capacity to receive and distribute crude oil and other products from the mid continent from  barrels per day to  barrels per day and allows the terminal to offload two car unit trains in a hour period 
our rail expansion serves to enhance our virtual pipeline solution for the transportation of crude oil and other products from the mid continent region to albany 
our rail shipments to albany average four or five days  with some shipments completed in as little as two and a half days 
from albany  it is then a one to one and a half day trip by barge to the east coast refineries 
we continued the construction of a new rail fed propane storage and distribution facility near our terminal in albany  new york 
this will be a single line rail haul facility serviced by canadian pacific 
we believe this storage location  which will have an initial capacity of  gallons  will be an attractive source of cost competitive mid continent propane for wholesale customers in the northeast 
we expect this project to be completed during the second quarter of also in  we signed a purchase agreement to acquire a membership interest in basin transload  which operates two transloading facilities in columbus and beulah  north dakota for crude oil and other products  with a combined rail loading capacity of  barrels per day 
we completed this transaction on february  please read items and business and properties recent developments for a further discussion 
significant activities in  we continued initiating organic expansion projects 
for example  in part  we i converted  barrels of storage capacity at our albany  new york terminal that are utilized for either distillates or gasoline  ii brought into service an additional  barrels of distillates and crude oil storage capacity at this facility and iii converted two tanks to handle bio fuel at our providence  rhode island terminal 
in march  and pursuant to our year brand fee agreement with exxonmobil  which provides us with the ability to provide mobil branded fuel to other authorized mobil distributors mobil sub jobbers  we began supplying mobil branded fuel to mobil sub jobbers  including alliance  in massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island and maine 
in november  we initiated an expansion project at our albany  new york terminal to increase our rail car receipt and offloading capacity of ethanol and crude oil 
in the fourth quarter of  we began buying mid continent crude oil and transporting it by rail to our albany  new york terminal for storage and subsequent sale in barge load quantities 
we also initiated a project to store product in north dakota 
significant activities in june  we acquired three refined petroleum products terminals located in newburgh  new york 
we believe the acquisition strengthened our presence along the hudson river in southeastern new york and enhanced terminal operating efficiencies with our adjacent facility 
in september  we acquired mobil branded retail gasoline stations located in massachusetts  new hampshire and rhode island and the right to supply mobil branded gasoline and diesel fuel to such stations and to mobil branded stations that are owned and operated by independent dealers 
the acquisition expanded our wholesale supply business and added vertical integration to our transportation fuel business 
in october  we completed an ethanol and rail expansion project that added  barrels of ethanol storage at our albany  new york terminal 
the project included modifications that enabled the terminal to schedule the delivery of car trains of ethanol and allows ethanol to be shipped directly on a single rail line from the midwest 
beyond supplying our own business  we further invested in our albany terminal by installing a marine vapor recovery system for barge vessel loading of ethanol and gasoline at the dock  and expanding the rack to allow for additional ethanol and gasoline sales 
we believe the supply efficiencies gained through this project position us to be a premier cost effective supplier of gasoline and ethanol to the northeast 
in a separate and complementary project  we converted two distillate storage tanks to gasoline storage at the albany facility 
these initiatives  combined with the return to service of three previously out of service tanks  increased the total storage capacity of our albany terminal to approximately million barrels  up from  barrels when we acquired the terminal in may 
table of contents events that impacted results during the year ended december   we experienced the following events in our gasoline distribution and station operations segment  our sales  volume and net product margin significantly increased due primarily to our acquisition of alliance  as well as a full year of sales of mobil branded fuel to mobil sub jobbers and to the getty realty agreements 
in our wholesale segment  our continued expansion into crude oil logistics  including the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil  improved our wholesale segment net product margin 
we believe our wholesale gasoline business was negatively impacted by a challenging futures market  which increased our hedging costs for  and less favorable buying opportunities which reduced our wholesale gasoline net product margin 
we believe our wholesale distillate business was negatively impacted due to less favorable buying opportunities and warmer weather in compared to the price for heating oil at december  compared to the price at december  increased by 
we believe heating oil conservation and conversions to natural gas continued during temperatures for were warmer than normal and warmer than which negatively affected demand for our weather related products during the year 
in connection with the acquisition of alliance  we had one time acquisition costs of approximately million for our interest expense increased by for  due primarily to additional borrowings associated with the acquisition of alliance 
in our gasoline distribution and station operations segment  declining gasoline prices typically improve our gasoline net product margins and rising gasoline prices typically compress our gasoline net product margins 
gasoline prices increased during the first and third quarters of  which compressed our gasoline net product margins  and declined in the second and fourth quarters  which improved our gasoline net product margins 
our net product margins for were also affected by a variety of other factors  such as movement of products between europe and the united states  weekly and monthly refinery output levels  changes in local  domestic and worldwide inventory levels  seasonality and supply disruptions 
during  we experienced the following events refined petroleum product and renewable fuel prices were higher during compared to our aggregate volume of product sold increased by approximately for compared to  due to an increase in bulk supply and exchange activity  strong demand for blendstocks  primarily ethanol  and the growth in our gasoline business as a result of a full year of ownership of our acquisitions and the commencement of gasoline sales to mobil sub jobbers under the brand fee agreement with exxonmobil 
temperatures for were warmer than normal 
we increased our reserve for bad debts by approximately million for  substantially due to specific risks related to one customer 

table of contents we reduced our workforce by approximately which resulted in restructuring charges of approximately million for our interest expense increased by for  primarily due to additional borrowings as a result of our acquisitions and to higher refined petroleum product and renewable fuel prices which increased our working capital requirements 
we believe heating oil conservation and conversions to natural gas continued during our operating expenses increased by million for compared to  primarily due to a full year of operations of the gasoline stations we acquired from exxonmobil in september we continued to experience a decline in our residual oil sales and volumes 
we believe our margins for were negatively impacted by less favorable market conditions and fewer advantageous purchasing opportunities in our distillates business and by a backward forward product pricing curve in our wholesale gasoline business 
we believe our margins for were also affected by a variety of other factors  such as movement of products between europe and the united states  weekly and monthly refinery output levels  changes in local  domestic and worldwide inventory levels  seasonality and supply dislocations 
during the year ended december  refined petroleum product prices increased during we increased our reserve for bad debts by approximately million for  substantially due to specific risks related to one customer 
temperatures for were warmer than normal 
we believe heating oil conservation and conversions to natural gas continued during we believe our results for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted due  in part  to adverse market conditions and fewer advantageous purchasing opportunities primarily in our distillates business 
we believe that these market conditions and fewer purchasing opportunities did not adversely impact the performance of our gasoline business including the acquisition of retail gasoline stations and supply rights from exxonmobil

table of contents the following table presents reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures on a historical basis in thousands year ended december  reconciliation of net income to ebitda net income depreciation and amortization and amortization of deferred financing fees interest expense income tax expense ebitda reconciliation of net cash provided by used in operating activities to ebitda net cash provided by used in operating activities net changes in operating assets and liabilities and certain non cash items interest expense income tax expense ebitda the following table presents reconciliations of distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures on a historical basis in thousands year ended december  reconciliation of net income to distributable cash flow net income depreciation and amortization and amortization of deferred financing fees amortization of routine bank refinancing fees maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash flow reconciliation of net cash provided by used in operating activities to distributable cash flow net cash provided by used in operating activities net changes in operating assets and liabilities and certain non cash items amortization of routine bank refinancing fees maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash flow commencing with the quarter ended march   our calculation of distributable cash flow excludes non cash amortization of deferred financing fees related to routine bank refinancing fees 
amortization of deferred financing fees in connection with our expansion related activities will continue to be included 
we believe that this provides a more conservative methodology to this non gaap financial measure 
had this methodology been used previously  it would not have affected distribution decisions or the outcome of the conversion of subordinated units to common units 
had this methodology been used for the year ended december   distributable cash flow would have been lower by approximately million

these futures contracts are entered into when inventory is purchased and are designated as fair value hedges against the inventory on a specific barrel basis 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
all hedged inventory is valued using the lower of cost  as determined by specific identification  or market 
prior to sale  hedges are removed from specific barrels of inventory  and the then unhedged inventory is sold and accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to our own inventory  we have exchange agreements with unrelated third party suppliers  whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and suppliers may draw inventory from us 
positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable

accounting and reporting guidance for leases requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
revenue recognition sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products  renewable fuels  crude oil and natural gas and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery  net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances 
we may also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale  which are included in cost of sales 
the amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis  such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers 
bad debt provisions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also recognize convenience store sales of gasoline  grocery and other merchandise and commissions on lottery at the time of the sale to the customer 
gasoline station rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements  which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products  renewable fuels and crude oil of a desired quality or to reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets 
any net differential for exchange agreements is recorded as a nonmonetary adjustment of inventory costs 
we collect trustee taxes  which consist of various pass through taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities  and remits such taxes directly to those taxing authorities 
as such  it is our policy to exclude trustee taxes from revenues and cost of sales and account for them as current liabilities 
derivative financial instruments accounting and reporting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure the instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are to be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we principally uses derivative instruments to hedge the commodity risk associated with our inventory and product purchases and sales and to hedge variable interest rates associated with our credit facilities 
fair value hedges we enter into futures contracts in the normal course of business to the reduce risk of loss of inventory value  which could result from fluctuations in market prices 
these futures contracts are designated as fair value hedges against the inventory with specific futures contracts matched to specific barrels of inventory 
as a result of our hedge designation on these transactions  the futures contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and marked to market through the use of independent markets based on the prevailing market prices of such instruments at the date of valuation 
likewise  the underlying inventory being hedged is also marked to market 
changes in the fair value of the futures contracts  as well as the change in the fair value of the hedged inventory  are recognized in the consolidated statement of income through cost of sales 
these futures contracts are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts 
cash flow hedges we utilize various interest rate derivative instruments to hedge variable interest rate on our debt 
these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges of the underlying debt 
to the extent such hedges are effective  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into interest expense or interest income in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 

table of contents in september  we executed a zero premium interest rate collar with a major financial institution 
the collar  which became effective on october  and expires on october   is used to hedge the variability in cash flows in monthly interest payments made on million of one month libor based borrowings on the working capital revolving credit facility and subsequent refinancings thereof due to changes in the one month libor rate 
in october  we executed an interest rate swap with a major financial institution 
the swap  which became effective on may  and expires on may   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the one month libor swap curve with respect to million of one month libor based borrowings on the revolving credit facility at a fixed rate of 
in april  we executed an interest rate cap with a major financial institution 
the rate cap  which became effective on april  and expires on april   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the one month libor rate above with respect to million of one month libor based borrowings on the working capital revolving credit facility 
other derivative activity we use futures contracts  and occasionally swap agreements  to hedge our commodity exposure under forward fixed price purchase and sale commitments on our products 
these derivatives are not designated by us as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges 
rather  the forward fixed price purchase and sales commitments  which meet the definition of a derivative  are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the related futures contracts and swaps  if applicable are also reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  thereby creating an economic hedge 
changes in the fair value of the futures contracts and swaps  if applicable  as well as offsetting gains or losses due to the change in the fair value of forward fixed price purchase and sale commitments  are recognized in the consolidated statement of income through cost of sales 
these futures contracts are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our product purchase activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as other logistical issues inherent in the business  such as weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions  maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  and managing the futures market outlook for future anticipated inventories  which are necessary for our business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of products at any one point in time 
any derivatives not involved in a direct hedging activity are marked to market and recognized in the consolidated statement of income through cost of sales 
we also market and sell natural gas by entering into forward purchase commitments for natural gas when we enter into arrangements for the forward sale commitment of product for physical delivery to third party users 
we reflect the fair value of forward fixed purchase and sales commitments in our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of the forward fixed price purchase and sale commitments are recognized in the consolidated statement of income through cost of sales 
during the year ended december   we entered into forward currency contracts to hedge certain foreign denominated canadian product purchases 
these forward contracts are not designated and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of these forward currency contracts are reflected in cost of sales 
valuation of intangibles and other long lived assets our long lived assets include property and equipment and intangible assets 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accordingly  we evaluate for impairment whenever indicators of impairment are identified 
factors we consider important include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results  significant negative industry factors and significant changes in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long lived assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  we assess impairment by comparing the undiscounted projected future cash flows from the long lived assets to their carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  the long lived assets will be reduced to their fair value 
the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized 
all of our goodwill is allocated to the gasoline distribution and station operations reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of october or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the impairment test first includes a qualitative assessment in order to conclude if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value 
if necessary  we would then complete a two step quantitative assessment 
factors included in the quantitative assessment include both macro economic conditions and industry specific conditions 
for the quantitative assessment  the reporting unit fair value is estimated using a weighted average of discounted cash flow approach and market comparables approach 
in the quantitative assessment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
environmental and other liabilities we record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes 
estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
we are subject to other contingencies  including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters  including  among others  environmental matters and contract and employment claims 
environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses we previously owned 
further  due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations  there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated 
please read item  legal proceedings 
related party transactions a discussion of related party transactions is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements a description and related impact expected from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and commodity risk 
we utilize an interest rate collar  an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap to manage exposure to interest rate risk and various derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity risk 

table of contents interest rate risk we utilize variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit agreement 
therefore  from time to time  we utilize interest rate collars  swaps and caps to hedge interest obligations on specific and anticipated debt issuances 
on november   we entered into an eighth amendment to our credit agreement 
total commitments under the credit agreement are billion 
please read item  management discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources credit agreement for information on interest rates related to our borrowings 
as of december   we had total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of million 
the impact of a increase in the interest rate on this amount of debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in our results of operations  of approximately million annually  assuming  however  that our indebtedness remained constant throughout the year 
in september  we executed a zero premium interest rate collar with a major financial institution 
the collar  which became effective on october  and expires on october   is used to hedge the variability in cash flows in monthly interest payments made on million of one month libor based borrowings on the working capital revolving credit facility and subsequent refinancings thereof due to changes in the one month libor rate 
in october  we executed an interest rate swap with a major financial institution 
the swap  which became effective on may  and expires on may   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the one month libor swap curve with respect to million of one month libor based borrowings on the revolving credit facility at a fixed rate of 
in april  we executed an interest rate cap with a major financial institution 
the rate cap  which became effective on april  and expires on april   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the one month libor rate above with respect to million of one month libor based borrowings on the working capital revolving credit facility 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments 
commodity risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to refined petroleum products  renewable fuels  crude oil and gasoline blendstocks in storage and expected purchases and sales of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures contracts traded on the nymex  cme and ice and over the counter transactions  including swap agreements entered into with established financial institutions and other credit approved energy companies 
our policy is generally to purchase only products for which we have a market and to structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our profit 
while our policies are designed to minimize market risk  as well as inherent basis risk  exposure to fluctuations in market conditions remains 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our product purchase activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as other logistical issues inherent in the business  such as weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions  maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace and managing the futures market outlook for future anticipated inventories  which are necessary for our business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of products at any one point in time 
any derivatives not involved in a direct hedging activity are marked to market and recognized in the consolidated statement of income through cost of sales 
in addition  because a portion of our crude oil business is conducted in canadian dollars  we may use foreign currency derivatives to minimize the risks of unfavorable exchange rates 
these instruments include foreign currency exchange contracts and forwards 
in conjunction with entering into the commodity derivative  we may enter into a foreign currency derivative to hedge the resulting foreign currency risk 
these foreign currency derivatives are generally short term in nature and not designated for hedge accounting 

table of contents we utilize futures contracts and other derivative instruments to minimize or hedge the impact of commodity price changes on our inventories and forward fixed price commitments 
any hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in our results of operations 
we utilize regulated exchanges  including the nymex  cme and ice  which are regulated exchanges for the commodities that each trades  thereby reducing potential delivery and supply risks 
generally  our practice is to close all exchange positions rather than to make or receive physical deliveries 
with respect to other energy products such as ethanol  which may not have a correlated exchange contract  we enter into derivative agreements with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile  in order to hedge market fluctuations and or lock in margins relative to our commitments 
at december   the fair value of all of our commodity risk derivative instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a price increase or decrease are shown in the table below in thousands gain loss fair value at december  effect of price increase effect of price decrease futures contracts swaps  options and other  net the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex and the cme 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at december  for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the physical market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board increase or decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
we have a daily margin requirement to maintain a cash deposit with our brokers based on the prior day market results on open futures contracts 
the balance of this deposit will fluctuate based on our open market positions and the commodity exchange requirements 
the brokerage margin balance was million at december  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties of futures contracts  forward contracts and swap agreements 
we anticipate some nonperformance by some of these counterparties which  in the aggregate  we do not believe at this time will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
futures contracts  the primary derivative instrument utilized  are traded on regulated exchanges  greatly reducing potential credit risks 
exposure on swap and certain option agreements is limited to the amount of the recorded fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
we utilize primarily two clearing brokers  both major financial institutions  for all nymex derivative transactions and the right of offset exists 
accordingly  the fair value of all derivative instruments is displayed on a net basis
