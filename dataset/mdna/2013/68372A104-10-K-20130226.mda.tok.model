we intend to continue to incur substantial expenses in advance of recognizing material related revenues as we attempt to further penetrate our existing international markets and selectively enter new markets 
some international markets may fail to meet our expectations  and we may decide to realign our focus  as we did when we closed our offices in spain and france in the fourth quarter of

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  the points based loyalty program  website and software development costs  income taxes and stock based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues include monthly subscription fees  a fee for each restaurant guest seated through online reservations and other revenue  including installation fees for our erb including training 
we provide our application as a service  and follow the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
amounts paid by the customer include the right to use our hardware during the service period 
proportionate revenue related to the right to use our hardware accounts for less than of revenues for the periods presented 
subscription revenues are recognized on a straight line basis during the contractual period over which the service is delivered 
reservation revenues or per seated diner fees are recognized on a transaction by transaction basis as diners are seated by our restaurant customers 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenues or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues are shown net of redeemable dining points issued to diners as described below 
revenues from the installation of our erb are recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life  commencing with customer acceptance 
the estimated customer life is approximately three to six years  based on historical restaurant customer termination activity 
estimates made by us may differ from actual customer lives 
these differences may materially affect other revenue by increasing or decreasing revenue  depending on whether the estimated customer life decreases or increases 
a change in the estimated customer life by one year in either direction would have a minimal impact to total revenue of less than 
to date  the impact of changes in the estimated customer life has not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

table of contents dining rewards loyalty programs in the us and certain of our international markets  we provide points based loyalty programs  opentable dining rewards  to registered diners who book and honor reservations through our websites and mobile apps 
opentable dining rewards involves the issuance of dining points  which can be accumulated and redeemed for dining checks 
for example  in the us  the standard award is points per reservation  but diners can earn  points for reservations during featured times under the opentable dining rewards program 
when a diner accumulates a minimum of  points  he or she may redeem them for a dining check 
every dining points is equal to one dollar 
diners may present dining checks at any opentable restaurant and their bill is reduced by the check amount 
the restaurant then deposits the dining check to its bank 
the features of the opentable dining rewards program in each international market  such as the amount for which points may be redeemed  vary by country 
if a diner does not make a seated reservation within any month period  then his or her account is considered inactive and the dining points balance is reset to zero 
as is typical with points based incentive programs  many dining points expire unused 
in addition  some dining checks are never used 
the recorded contra revenue is an estimate of the eventual cash outlay related to the issued dining points and is booked at the time the points are earned by the diner ie  when the diner is seated by the restaurant 
we estimate the liability for the issued dining points by analyzing historical patterns of redemption and check cashing activity 
these historical patterns are evaluated in light of any current or proposed program changes that may impact future point redemption 
actual redemption rates could differ from our estimates used in assessing the contra revenue amounts and corresponding liability  particularly if participation in our premium listings programs  with higher point awards  increases 
these differences could materially affect reservation revenues 
for example  an increase of in the redemption rate as of december  would result in a reduction in revenues for the year of million and an increase in the dining rewards payable liability at year end of 
we recognize the corresponding liability associated with dining points as contra revenue in accordance with asc topic revenue recognition customer payments and incentives 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets  including goodwill long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event  such as service discontinuance or technological obsolescence  indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset may not be recoverable 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred often involves significant judgment from management 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if the comparison indicates that an impairment exists  the amount of the impairment is calculated and a charge is recorded 
the amount of the impairment is determined to be the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist for the asset  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in any impairment evaluation and our estimates  including estimates used in determining future cash flows 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we review goodwill for impairment as of august and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of this asset may exceed its fair value 
our assessment is performed at the reporting unit level 
the goodwill evaluation for impairment is performed using a two step process 
the first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the book value  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of 
table of contents impairment 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under the two step model involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units is determined using discounted future cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on management best estimate of future revenues and operating expenses  based primarily on expected growth in installed restaurants  seated diners  pricing and general economic conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and is based on the net assets for each unit  including goodwill and intangible assets 
we assign goodwill to each operating segment as this represent the lowest level which constitutes a business and for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews 
we have determined that we have two geographical reporting units north america and the united kingdom 
the fair value of our north america reporting unit  which carries approximately million in goodwill associated with the acquisitions with respect to guestbridge  inc  table maestro llc  or table maestro  and treat technologies  inc  or treat  exceeds the carrying value significantly  indicating no impairment in goodwill for the north america reporting unit 
the fair value of the uk reporting unit  which carries approximately million in goodwill associated with the toptable acquisition  exceeds the carrying value  indicating no goodwill impairment for the uk reporting unit 
during the year  management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test 
for the periods presented  no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test 
as a measure of sensitivity  a decrease in the fair value of either of our reporting units as of december  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
website and software development costs costs related to website and internal use software are accounted for in accordance with asc topic intangibles website development costs topic 
such software is primarily related to our websites and mobile apps  including support systems 
we capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed  management has authorized and committed project funding  and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended 
costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are amortized when the project is completed and placed in service on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset  generally estimated between two to three years 
costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the enhancements 
we follow the guidance in asc topic software in accounting for costs incurred in connection with development of the software contained in the erb used by all restaurant customers  and in a limited number of certain transactions we sell reservation systems that do not include our ongoing service 
all costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of a computer product to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and through general product release are capitalized and amortized over the estimated product life 
the period between technological feasibility and general product release is generally short  and the costs incurred during this stage are not considered to be material and are expensed as incurred 
income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic income taxes topic 
under this method  income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for 
table of contents deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with topic the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been considered 
for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included herein  we estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of our tax returns 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and to the extent we believe that realizability is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance  we consider all the evidence available to us  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as of december   it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized  with the exception of certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign net operating losses which did not meet the more likely than not realizability threshold 
a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
stock based compensation we measure stock based awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock units in accordance with asc topic stock compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized using a graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated income statements 
the cost of restricted stock units is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period

international subscription revenues increased from million in  to million in  to million in international subscription revenues increased in despite an overall decrease in the number of installed restaurants  as a result of an increase in the number of installed restaurants from which we generated meaningful revenues 
in the second quarter of  we relaunched the toptable site and simultaneously removed restaurants from our installed restaurant base that did not migrate to opentable technology 
most of the restaurants that did not migrate were restaurants from which we had been generating little to no revenues 
after adjusting for this one time event  installed restaurants on opentable technology increased from december  to december  international loss from operations increased from million in  to million in  and decreased to million in the increase in the loss from operations in years and is due to the ongoing investment in our international expansion efforts 
we increased headcount and acquired toptable in the fourth quarter of the decrease in the loss in was due primarily to the increase in revenue  as a result of the increase in seated diners

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss topic 
topic changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and ifrs 
topic also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
topic is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
the adoption of this standard did not change our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic presentation of comprehensive income topic 
topic eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
topic requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended guidance  which must be applied retroactively  is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard changed the presentation of our consolidated financial statements but had no effect on the reported amounts of comprehensive income 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
topic is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists today is necessary 
topic permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
topic is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and earlier adoption is permitted 
the company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the third quarter of each year 
for the test conducted as of august   the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform only the quantitative assessment 
the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate  foreign exchange risks and inflation 
interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  money market accounts  certificates of deposit and us government agency securities 
short term investments consist of us government agency securities and certificates of deposit 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenues and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound sterling  the euro  the japanese yen  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
