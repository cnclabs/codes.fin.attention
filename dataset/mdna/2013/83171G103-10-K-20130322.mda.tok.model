item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of see forward looking statements following the table of contents of this k 
because this discussion involves risk and uncertainties  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we measure our operations using both financial and other metrics 
the financial metrics include revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and income from continuing operations 
other key metrics include i revenues by sales source  ii online sales  iii cash flows and iv ebitda 
some of the most significant trends affecting our business are the following the increasing recognition by professionals and corporations that they must continually improve their skills and those of their employees in order to remain competitive  continuing and expanding professional education requirements by governing bodies  including states and professional associations  the plethora of new laws and regulations affecting the conduct of business and the relationship between employers and their employees  the increased competition in today economy for skilled employees and the recognition that effective training can be used to recruit and train employees  the development and acceptance of the internet as a delivery channel for the types of products and services we offer  current economic conditions  and competition 
over the last four years  we have experienced fluctuations in our annual net revenues due to various reasons  including the recession that began in nevertheless  since we have experienced an overall decrease in net revenues from million in to million in the decrease is due in large part to the downturn in the economy that began in although we have made acquisitions during this period that have increased our net revenues  a decline in demand for customized training solutions  competition  personnel reductions and reduced budgets in many of client firms and other factors have all contributed to the decline 
we intend to continue focusing on acquisitions that will allow us to increase the breadth and depth of our current product offerings focusing on the general corporate market for compliance  governance and ethics 
we will also consider acquisitions that will give us access to new markets and products 
we prefer acquisitions that are accretive  as opposed to those that are dilutive  but ultimately the decision will be based on maximizing shareholder value rather than short term profits 
the size of the acquisitions will be determined  in part  by the capital available to us and the liquidity and price of our common stock 
we may use debt to enhance or augment our ability to consummate larger transactions 
there are many risks involved with acquisitions  some of which are discussed in item a of part of this report under the caption certain risk factors that may affect our growth and profitability 
these risks include identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  successfully negotiating the business  legal and financial terms of the acquisitions  integrating the acquired business into our existing operations and corporate structure  retaining key employees and minimizing disruptions to our existing business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities or negotiate reasonable terms or that any acquired business or assets will deliver the shareholder value that we anticipated at the outset 
with respect to our performance for the recently completed fiscal year  continued weakness in the economy affected us resulting in decreased revenues 
the decrease of approximately million in revenues from  was offset somewhat by decreased selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately  and decreased depreciation and amortization of approximately  however  after careful analysis described more fully in this annual report we recorded an impairment of goodwill from one of our subsidiaries of  in addition  based on projected income and other factors we have decreased our deferred tax asset by  the decrease in net revenues was mainly attributable to the fact that we continue to experience a decrease in demand for custom work and decreased attendance in parts of our live seminar business 
our core subscription based business had reduced net revenues  as customers are either imposing restrictions on their employees or are seeking lower cost alternatives to mandatory continuing education requirements 
overall net revenues from our accounting finance division decreased as a consequence of these factors 
we had a small increase in net revenues in our cognistar legal training division  while most of our other divisions had decreases in net revenues 
in order to reduce our operating expenses  we eliminated live seminars that had sub par performance which  while reducing gross revenue  had a positive impact on our operating results 
in addition  our fourth quarter live training revenues were impacted as a result of the storms in the northeast that resulted in many seminars being either canceled or we experienced reduced attendance 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to a number of factors including reduced compensation expense  rents  and advertising and marketing  while other costs such as those relating to our technology and customer service increased 
as the overall business environment improves  we expect net revenues from our major business units to increase 
we continually monitor our direct and general and administrative costs and make the necessary adjustments where warranted 
we are also always looking for new markets and distribution channels for our existing products and we continue to expend a significant amount of money to upgrade our library  create new products and develop new technology 
seasonality and cyclicality historically  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter  primarily because a portion of our business is non subscription based 
custom jobs and consulting work are subject to both the general business climate and client s needs 
net revenue from our engineering division is subject to staffing levels in both the private and public sector and the timing of various licensing exams 
in economic downturns  staff reductions result in fewer people taking professional engineering licensing exams 
our subscription based revenue is spread over the life of the subscription which is generally one year and can be effected by staff reductions as well 
with our acquisitions of loscalzo and eei  these quarterly fluctuations have become more evident and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
both loscalzo and eei generate most of their revenue from live training programs 
in eei s case  the revenue is recognized almost exclusively in the second and fourth quarters  when the sessions take place 
in loscalzo s case  the revenue tends to be recognized over the second  third and fourth quarters  with the fourth quarter revenue being the greatest 
while the costs that are directly related to the production of this revenue are incurred over the same period  both loscalzo and eei have general and administrative expenses that are incurred ratably over the year  creating the fluctuations in our operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition 
revenues a large portion of our net revenues is in the form of subscription fees for our monthly accounting update programs or access to our accounting  financial services  legal and information technology course libraries 
other sources of net revenues include direct sales of programs or courses on a non subscription basis or from various forms of live training  fees for website design  software development  video production  course design and development  ongoing maintenance of the lms  and licensing fees 
subscriptions are billed on an annual basis  payable in advance and deferred at the time of billing 
sales made over the internet are by credit card only 
renewals are usually sent out days before the subscription period ends 
larger transactions are usually dealt with by contract  the financial terms of which depend on the services being provided 
revenues from subscription services are recognized as earned  deferred at the time of billing or payment and amortized into revenue on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription 
engineering products are non subscription based and revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product or  in the case of online sales  payment 
revenues from live training are recognized when earned  usually upon the completion of the seminar or conference 
revenues from non subscription services provided to customers  such as website design  video production  consulting services and custom projects are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis where sufficient information relating to project status and other supporting documentation is available 
the contracts may have different billing arrangements resulting in either unbilled or deferred revenue 
we obtain either a signed agreement or purchase order from our non subscription customers outlining the terms and conditions of the sale or service to be provided 
otherwise  these services are recognized as revenues after completion and delivery to the customer 
duplication and related services are generally recognized upon shipment or  if later  when our obligations are complete and realization of receivable amounts is assured 
we have recently hired additional sales and sales support personnel based on recent improvements in general economic conditions and we want to be in a position to be able to address increased customer demand for our products and services 
however  we intend to proceed cautiously in this area until we are reasonably certain that the economic recovery is sustainable 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived tangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year and or whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered or are impaired 
goodwill is evaluated by comparing the value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable company s data 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
any impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the evaluation of the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset against estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with it 
impairment may be caused by a number of factors  including a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
upon completing our review  testing and considerable analysis including significant assumptions and judgments by management for the current period  we have recognized an impairment in the goodwill from our skye subsidiary of  our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely  heavily  on projections of future operating performance 
there is no assurance that such results will be achieved and in that case we may be required to record an additional impairment to our goodwill and other long lived intangible assets in future periods 
stock based compensation compensation costs are recognized in the financial statements at fair value for stock options or grants awarded to employees and directors 
options and warrants granted to non employees are recorded as an expense at the date of grant based on the then estimated fair value of the security granted 
the fair value of the options at grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
stock grants to employees and directors are charged to expense at the closing price of the our common stock at date of grant 
segment reporting all of our operations constitute a single segment  that of educational services 
net revenues from non educational services  such as video production are not a material part of our operating income 
income taxes we account for deferred tax assets available principally from our fixed and intangible assets and our net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with the accounting standards codification 
we make significant estimates and assumptions in calculating our current period income tax liability and deferred tax assets 
the most significant of these are estimates regarding future period earnings 
our net deferred tax asset is estimated by management using a three year taxable income projection that incorporates significant estimates and assumptions of future operating periods  including potential new business from either the introduction of new products or greater sales efforts  as well as planned cost reductions 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and the following table compares our statement of operations data for the years ended december   and the trends suggested by this table may not be indicative of future operating results  which will depend on various factors including the relative mix of products sold accounting finance  engineering or corporate training and the method of sale video or online 
year ended december amount percentage amount percentage change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill total operating expenses operating loss income other income  net loss income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income net revenues net revenues for decreased  compared to net revenues for  primarily as a result of the decrease in subscription based revenue in accounting finance and financial services as well as decreases in other product lines 
our live training businesses represents approximately of our net revenues 
net revenues from subscription based products delivered on line and other related net revenues accounted for approximately million  or  of our net revenues 
net revenues from our accounting finance division decreased in absolute dollars by approximately  but increased as a percentage of total net revenues 
net revenues from our accounting finance and related products decreased from approximately million in to million in net revenues from accounting finance products including both subscription and non subscription based revenue was million in and million in net revenues from live training  custom work and advertising were approximately and million in and  respectively 
net revenues from sales of our engineering products  which are not subscription based  were  in  compared to  in the continual decline in engineering net revenues is due to a number of reasons including fewer exam candidates and purchasing curtailments by both engineering firms and governmental agencies 
however  we recently signed an agreement with villanova university to market their electrical engineering exam prep course 
in addition  we are updating some of our existing courses  adding new courses and constantly seeking partners with which to market these products 
net revenues from sle increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily due to an increase of  from our cognistar legal division  offset by a decrease of  from our working value ethics division 
the ethics division income is derived primarily from custom consulting jobs 
the increase in cognistar net revenues is due to custom work from a client with whom we are building a portal to host their legal education course material 
we will share revenue generated by the portal with that client 
with the launch of ecampus in  we believe that this will have a positive effect on net revenues as clients can now go to one website for all of their educational needs 
skye generated  of net revenues in  compared to  in skye produces customized training and educational material for the pharmaceutical industry  professional firms  financial services companies and others 
as we believe that the economy is recovering from the recession  we expect an increase in request for proposals 
however  the revenue recognition cycle for this type of work can be long as there can be a time lag between the time a client engages skye and the actual work begins 
this results in a shift in earned income  as contracts are signed and the work is postponed for a period of months 
our financial services training division generated net revenues of million in  compared to million in the decrease is a result of the loss of some subscription revenue and the timing of completion of custom work 
our technology training division  smartit  generated net revenues of  in  compared to  of revenues in  due to an increase in subscription revenue 
net revenues from video production  duplication and consulting services increased in to  from  in  as a result of increased consulting work offset by a reduction in video work 
video production and duplication income fluctuates annually  but overall they continue to decline 
the duplication business has declined because tape is no longer used and we do not have the capability of doing very large dvd duplication projects 
our video production facility is primarily used for internal work and income results from renting our facilities and or our equipment 
consulting work varies from year to year and sales are credited to the department from which they originate and not to the department where the work is performed 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes i production costs  such as the salaries  benefits and other costs related to personnel  whether our employees or independent contractors  who are used directly in connection with producing or conducting our educational programs  ii royalties paid to third parties  iii the cost of materials  such as dvds  printed matter and packaging materials and iv shipping costs 
compared to  cost of revenues in were relatively constant at approximately million 
this is primarily due to increased use of outsourced labor at lower costs for both internal needs as well as those costs related to specific custom jobs offset by increased costs related to live seminars 
although  cost of revenues decreased in real dollars from million in to million in  as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues in increased to from in this resulted in a corresponding decrease in our gross profit margin from in to in there are many different types of expenses that are characterized as production costs and they vary from period to period depending on many factors 
the expenses that showed the greatest variations from to and the reasons for those variations are as follows outside labor and direct production costs 
outside labor includes the cost of hiring actors and production personnel such as directors  producers and cameramen and the outsourcing of non video technology 
it also includes the costs of instructors for live training and the production of those courses 
these costs increased by approximately  in from both skye and our consulting technology departments employ a number of consultants to write scripts  edit course material  provide technology services and help develop new products such as skye role play certification tool and the coaching toolkit 
loscalzo and eei employ a number of consultants to develop course material  in addition to hiring instructors to deliver programs throughout the united states 
we have been outsourcing some of the programming and content development functions that were previously done by our employees to firms in india at a substantial savings 
direct production costs  which are costs related to producing videos other than labor costs such as the cost of renting equipment and locations  and the purchase of materials decreased by  these variations are related to the type of video production and custom projects and do not reflect any trends in our business 
salaries 
overall payroll and related costs attributable to production personnel increased by approximately  the increase was primarily attributable to salary increases and allocations of employees salaries 
our overall headcount did not increase 
our sle and skye salaries and related costs decreased by  salaries and related costs from our loscalzo subsidiary increased approximately  as a result of the allocation of the division president duties 
there were no additional employees in loscalzo 
our fc division accounted for an additional  in savings  offset by an increase of  in our technology division 
royalties 
royalty expense decreased by  in from  from approximately million in to million in royalty expense is directly related to sales of certain products in our accounting and engineering catalogs  and as usage fluctuates so does our royalty expense 
we often have to estimate the royalty expense due our partners  as the information may not be readily available 
if volume increases or if we enter into new agreements or modify existing agreements  the actual royalty payments in under these agreements may be either higher or lower than they were in other costs 
this includes the cost of venues for our live training business  travel for instructors and others  shipping costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
these other costs increased by  primarily related to eei s live training business 
the largest component of these expenses are venue  travel and course administration costs that increased by  in from although purchases increased by  this was offset by a decrease in shipping and other costs of  travel costs incurred by skye and loscalzo are often billed to their respective clients 
as our business grows  we may be required to hire additional production personnel  increasing our cost of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include corporate overhead such as i compensation and benefits for administrative  sales and marketing and finance personnel  ii rent  iii insurance  iv professional fees  v travel and entertainment and vi office expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased by  from  a decrease 
the decrease in terms of actual expenses is primarily from reductions in payroll and related costs as headcounts have been reduced 
reductions in compensation expense totaled  overhead expenses for advertising  promotional material and other selling expenses decreased by approximately  exclusive of these increases  other overhead expenses remained constant due to reductions in expense such as the cost of processing credit card transactions  decreases in rent and utilities expenses offset by higher outsourced customer service and sales personnel 
the cost of maintaining our technology  such as annual software and maintenance licenses as well as our bandwidth costs continue to increase 
in addition  in conformity with applicable accounting standards  we are expensing the costs associated with the grants of options and restricted stock to employees and directors 
this non cash expense in was  and  in we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will remain constant in at our current level of operations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were  lower in than they were in this decrease is primarily from intangible assets acquired in acquisitions that are now fully amortized offset by the capitalization of intangible assets developed internally principally our new lms  known as ecampus 
the total capitalized cost of ecampus is million and is being amortized over five years 
although we are always upgrading our computer hardware and systems  and with some projects in development  we expect our depreciation and amortization expenses on our fixed and intangible assets to decrease  as many of the assets acquired in prior acquisitions are either fully or nearly completely amortized 
impairment of goodwill we continuously monitor our goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment 
we perform an annual review prior to our year end or when circumstances indicate an event has occurred that would cause an earlier review of goodwill 
in  after careful analysis of expected future operating cash flows and other tests  we determined that the goodwill acquired as a result of the contingent purchase price paid for skye multimedia  ltd 
was impaired by  we will continue to monitor these assets for any possible future impairment 
it is possible that based on future operating results that we may incur additional impairment to this and our other long lived assets 
operating loss income for  our operating loss was million  compared to an operating income of  in the decrease in net revenues of approximately million  the impairment loss of  offset by decreased cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization of approximately  resulted in the increased loss 
other income  net other income and expense items primarily consist of interest earned on deposits  offset by the loss from our joint venture in ireflect  llc 
we currently have no outstanding debt  other than normal trade payables 
net interest income increased by  due to higher interest rates we received from our cash in in addition  our joint venture in ireflect resulted in a loss of  in  compared to a loss of  in income tax expense in  we recorded a net tax expense of  compared to a  net tax expense in we have analyzed all of the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and have recorded a net tax deferred asset of  in as compared to a net tax deferred asset in of million 
this resulted in a net deferred tax provision of  in after increasing our valuation allowance to approximately  in  there was no change to our deferred tax asset from the and tax expense consists of state and local income tax expense of approximately  net loss income for  we recorded a net loss of million compared to a net income of  for the decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease in net revenues of approximately million  the impairment loss of  and the reduction in our net deferred tax of  asset offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses and lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources since becoming a public company in  we have financed our working capital requirements entirely through internally generated funds 
we have not had any sales of stock or incurred any debt 
our working capital as of december   was approximately million compared to a million working capital as of december  the decrease is attributable to a number of factors including the payment of approximately  in dividends  and the repurchase of our common stock for approximately  our current ratio at december   is to  compared to to at december  the current ratio is derived by dividing current assets by current liabilities and is a measure used by lending sources to assess our ability to repay short term liabilities 
the largest component of our current liabilities  approximately million and million at december   and respectively  is deferred revenue  which is revenue collected or billed but not yet earned under the principles of revenue recognition 
most of this deferred revenue at december  is in the form of subscription fees and will be earned during the cost of fulfilling our monthly subscription obligation does not exceed this revenue and is booked to expense as incurred 
for some of our products  there are no additional costs  other than shipping costs  required to complete this obligation as the material is already in our library 
for the year ended december   we had a net decrease in cash of  after the purchase of  in certificates of deposit 
we generated  in cash from operations  offset by  used in investing activities  including the  for purchase of the certificates of deposit   for asset acquisitions and  for the capitalization of software and courses and  for business assets acquired 
in addition  our financing activities include  for the purchase of treasury shares and  for the payment of dividends 
the primary components of our operating cash flows are our net income adjusted for non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  and the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and deferred revenues 
in comparison  for the year ended december   we had a  decrease in cash 
that decrease was a result of cash generated by operations of  that was offset by cash expended for investing activities of million primarily for asset acquisitions and capitalization of software and courses  and  for the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of dividends 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   were approximately  of which  consisted primarily of computer equipment and software 
we capitalized  of costs for the production of various courses and for capitalizing the costs of software 
we are constantly reviewing and upgrading our technology 
for fiscal  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures other than software and course development costs 
we believe that our current cash balances together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
on march   our board of directors declared a dividend of 
per common share payable on april   to shareholders of record on march  during march  we purchased  shares of our common stock for  at an average price of per share 
as a result   remain available for repurchases under our stock buy back program 
contractual obligation  commitments and contingencies as of december   we had commitments under various leases for our offices in hawthorne  new york  the sle office in westborough  massachusetts  skye s offices in bridgewater  new jersey  and loscalzo s office in shrewsbury  new jersey 
the total aggregate commitment under these leases is approximately million through january sle lease expired in january and had called for a monthly rent of approximately  sle is currently occupying its office on a month to month basis 
the skye lease was recently extended to january at a monthly rental of  and the lease for the loscalzo office expires on december   at a monthly rent of approximately  in the future  we may issue additional debt or equity securities to satisfy our cash needs 
any debt incurred or issued may be secured or unsecured  at a fixed or variable interest rate and may contain other terms and conditions that our board of directors deems prudent 
any sales of equity securities may be at or below current market prices 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in generating sufficient capital to adequately fund our liquidity needs 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities or money market funds  we may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
credit risk most of our cash is held in deposit accounts  us treasury and non treasury money market funds 
our bank deposit accounts are insured by the us government but only up to a maximum of  at any one bank 
our money market funds are held in a brokerage account that is insured by the security industry protection corp up to  and various brokerage firms may carry additional insurance from commercial insurance companies 
our cash balances vary from time to time based on a variety of factors but in most cases are significantly in excess of the insurable limit 
as a result  we have exposure on these accounts in the event these financial institutions become insolvent 
in addition  we may have credit risk with respect to customers who default on custom orders or who default on subscription payments 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to topic intangibles goodwill and other 
this amendment is intended to simplify how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative impairment test described in topic no further testing is required if the qualitative factors indicate that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
this amendment is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we do not expect this amendment to have any significant impact on the current year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a smaller reporting company  as defined by regulation s k  and  as such  we are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant to regulation s k
