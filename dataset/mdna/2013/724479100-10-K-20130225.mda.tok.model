certain amounts and discussions below have been changed to reflect the reclassification of our international mailing services ims operations  previously included in our mail services segment  as a discontinued operation 
all table amounts are presented in millions of dollars  unless otherwise stated 
table amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding 
overview revenue for decreased to  million compared to  million in as worldwide economic conditions  pricing pressures  declining mail volumes and constrained public sector spending in europe all contributed to the decline 
worldwide economic conditions continue to impact equipment sales  which declined compared to last year 
declining equipment sales in prior periods also impacts financing revenue  which declined in compared to rentals and supplies revenue both declined due to a decline in mail volumes and our installed meter base 
software revenue declined mainly due to an overall economic uncertainty in our global markets  particularly in our european and asia pacific markets 
net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share for were million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  in the improvement in was primarily due to lower restructuring charges and goodwill impairment charges partially offset by higher tax expense due to tax benefits recognized from tax settlements in as a result of the continuing under performance of our ims operations  and to enable us to better focus on higher growth cross border ecommerce parcel opportunities  we began exploring strategic alternatives to exit the ims operations related to the international delivery of mail and catalogs 
during the year  we recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges of million to write down the net assets of ims to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
these charges and the operating results of ims for all periods presented have been classified as discontinued operations 
for the year  cash flow from operations declined to million compared to million in lower cash flow in was primarily due to higher tax payments and a lower cash impact from net collections of finance and accounts receivables 
also in  we received million from the sale of leveraged lease assets and million from the issuance of new debt  while uses of cash included million to redeem maturing debt  million to pay dividends and million to fund capital investments 
at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
outlook worldwide economic conditions continue to create a challenging business environment causing many of our clients to remain cautious about spending and therefore impact the performance of our business segments 
our growth initiatives continue to focus on leveraging our expertise in physical communications with our expanding capabilities in digital and hybrid communications and developing products  software  services and solutions that help our clients grow their businesses by more effectively communicating with their customers 
we expect to make continued investments in these growth initiatives during the first half of  which are expected to lead to greater revenue and margin contribution in the second half of we expect revenue growth in certain of our enterprise business solutions segments in from our ecommerce  print outsourcing and software solutions 
we expect our mix of business will continue to shift to more enterprise related products and solutions and that these new revenue streams will have lower margins than our traditional mailing business 
small and medium business solutions revenues will continue to be challenged by the decline in physical mail volumes 
however  in  we expect revenue will benefit from an improvement in equipment sales trends  due in part to global sales of our connect tm communications systems and sendsuite live tm shipping solutions  and that this improvement will lead to a moderation in the decline of rentals  financing and supplies revenue in the second half of results of operations revenue by source and the related cost of revenue are shown in the following tables revenue year ended december  change equipment sales supplies software rentals financing support services business services total revenue cost of revenue year ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue cost of equipment sales cost of supplies cost of software cost of rentals financing interest expense cost of support services cost of business services total cost of revenue equipment sales equipment sales revenue decreased to million in compared to as worldwide economic conditions continue to impact customer purchasing behavior

financing financing revenue decreased in compared to and in compared to primarily due to declining equipment sales in prior periods 
financing interest expense as a percentage of revenue was  and in  and  respectively 
the year over year increases were due to higher effective interest rates 
financing interest expense represents our cost of borrowing associated with the generation of financing revenue 
in computing financing interest expense  we assume a leverage ratio of debt to equity and apply our overall effective interest rate to the average outstanding finance receivables

these actions consisted primarily of workforce reductions and resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
during the year  we also reversed a net million of restructuring reserves based on a review of our remaining obligations under prior programs 
restructuring charges in and represent charges taken in connection with a series of strategic transformation initiatives announced in these initiatives were designed to transform and enhance the way we operate as a global company  enhance our responsiveness to changing market conditions and create improved processes and systems and were implemented over a three year period through restructuring charges and asset impairments also include asset impairment charges unrelated to restructuring actions of million in both and restructuring charges associated with our ims operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations

business segments we conduct our business activities in seven reporting segments within two business groups  small medium business solutions and enterprise business solutions 
the following tables show revenue and ebit by business segment for  and the ims business  now reported as a discontinued operation  was previously included in our mail services segment 
segment ebit  a non gaap measure  is determined by deducting from segment revenue the related costs and expenses attributable to the segment 
segment ebit excludes interest  taxes  general corporate expenses not allocated to a particular business segment  restructuring charges  asset impairments and goodwill charges  which are recognized on a consolidated basis 
management uses segment ebit to measure profitability and performance at the segment level 
segment ebit may not be indicative of our overall consolidated performance and therefore  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated results of operations 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment ebit to income from continuing operations before income taxes

ebit decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to the decline in revenue  however  ebit margin was slightly improved over last year due in part to prior strategic initiatives  productivity improvements and lower credit losses 
north america mailing revenue in decreased to  million compared to  million in foreign currency translation had a less than favorable impact on revenue 
excluding the effects of foreign currency  equipment sales declined as increased concerns about economic conditions resulted in customers delaying purchases of new equipment and extending leases of existing equipment 
lease extensions are profitable transactions but generate less revenue in the current period than new equipment sales 
the lagging effects of lower equipment sales in prior periods  fewer meter placements and declining mail volumes contributed to declines in financing revenue  rental revenue  supplies revenue and service revenue 
ebit decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower revenues  however  ebit margin improved as a result of continued productivity improvements and lower credit losses

marketing services marketing services revenue decreased to million compared to million in in part due to a decline in household moves but ebit increased to million compared to million in due to lower print production costs and administrative costs 
we expect segment revenue in to decline and ebit to decline by about a third due to lower fees for certain renegotiated contracts 
marketing services revenue and ebit for were flat compared to liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash generated from operations  existing cash and investments and borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program are currently sufficient to support our cash needs  including items like business operations  debt repayments and customer deposits as well as discretionary uses such as capital investments  dividends and share repurchases 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  we have had the ability to supplement short term liquidity through our consistent and uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market to date 
we have the ability to fund the long term needs of our business through broad access to capital markets  cash flow  proceeds from divestitures  a credit line facility and our effective shelf registration statement 
during the year  the rating agencies reduced our credit ratings 
there can be no assurances that one or more of the rating agencies will not take additional adverse actions in the future 
we continuously review our liquidity profile through published credit ratings and the credit default swap market 
we also monitor the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties  depository banks or credit providers 
cash flow summary during the fourth quarter of  we determined that  beginning with the three month period ended december  and each subsequent three month period through september   changes in certain investment related working capital accounts that were classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flows from operating activities should have been classified as cash flows from investing activities 
the cash flow amounts in the table below for the year ended december  have been revised to reflect the correct classification of cash flows  resulting in an increase in cash provided by operating activities and an increase in cash used in investing activities of million 
the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows year ended december  change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents change in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily due to higher tax payments in resulting from the sale of leveraged lease assets  the loss of bonus depreciation and higher income tax refunds received in the cash impact of finance and accounts receivables were also million lower in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in was relatively unchanged from cash provided by operating activities of million in cash flow in benefited from lower tax payments of million and higher net collections of finance and accounts receivables of million but these benefits were offset by a special pension plan contribution of million and higher payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
cash flow in benefited from proceeds of million received from the unwinding of interest rate swaps 
the decrease in current and non current income taxes of million in includes the tax benefits recognized in connection with the irs tax settlements 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in the improvement in cash used in was due to lower net purchases of investment securities partially offset by higher capital expenditures and lower growth in customer deposits 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds of million from the sale of leveraged lease assets  lower net purchases of investment securities of million and acquisitions of million in these improvements were partially offset by higher capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash used was due to higher debt reduction partially offset by lower share repurchases 
during the year  million of debt matured and was repaid and we issued million of new debt 
in  the reduction in debt was million 
during  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock compared to million of share repurchases in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower repayments of notes payable due to an overall decline in commercial paper borrowings in compared to dividends we paid dividends to our common stockholders of million per share  million per share and million per share in  and  respectively 
going forward  each quarter our board of directors will continue to consider our recent and projected earnings and other capital needs and priorities in deciding whether to approve the amount and payment of a dividend 
on january   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of cent per share for the first quarter of there are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends 
financings and capitalization we are a well known seasoned issuer with the sec  which allows us to issue debt securities  preferred stock  preference stock  common stock  purchase contracts  depositary shares  warrants and units in an expedited fashion 
we have a commercial paper program that is an important source of liquidity for us and a committed credit facility of billion to support our commercial paper issuances 
the credit facility expires in april we have not drawn upon the credit facility 
at december   there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings 
during the year  commercial paper borrowings averaged million at a weighted average interest rate of and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was million 
in  commercial paper borrowings averaged million at a weighted average interest rate of and the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding at any point in time was million 
in october  we borrowed million under term loan agreements 
the loans bear interest at the applicable london interbank offered rate libor plus or prime rate plus  at our option 
interest is payable quarterly and the loans mature in and the proceeds from the loans are for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of debt maturities 
in november  we issued million of year notes with a coupon rate of 
interest is paid quarterly beginning february the notes mature in november  however  we may redeem some or all of the notes at anytime on or after november at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the proceeds from the notes are for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of debt maturities 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries were million at december  and million at december  cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries are generally used to support the liquidity needs of these subsidiaries 
most of these amounts could be repatriated to the us but would be subject to additional taxes 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following summarizes our known contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest payments on debt non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension plan contributions retiree medical payments total the amount and period of future payments related to our income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and are not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
interest payments on debt includes interest on our million notes due in bondholders may redeem these notes  in whole or in part  at par plus accrued interest  in january if all million of the notes are redeemed in january  total interest payments would be reduced by million 
interest payments on debt also include interest on the million notes due in these notes may be redeemed by us  in whole or in part  at anytime on or after november at par plus accrued interest 
if we redeem all the notes in november  total interest payments would be reduced by million 
purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
pension plan contributions represent the amount we anticipate making to our pension plans during  however  we will assess our funding alternatives as the year progresses 
our retiree health benefit plans are non funded plans and cash contributions are made each year to cover medical claims costs incurred 
the amounts reported in the above table represent our estimate of future benefits payments 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about certain items that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and accompanying disclosures  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the accounting policies below have been identified by management as those accounting policies that are most critical to our financial statements due to the estimates and assumptions required 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate based on the information available at the time the financial statements were prepared  however  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition multiple element arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a sale of non cancelable lease of equipment  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  revenue is recognized for each of the elements based on their respective fair values 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
for a sale transaction  revenue is allocated to the equipment based on a range of selling prices in standalone transactions 
for a lease transaction  revenue is allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average selling prices 
the allocation of fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
pension benefits the valuation of our pension assets and obligations and the calculation of net periodic pension expense are dependent on assumptions and estimates relating to  among other things  the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the discount rate for our largest plan  the us qualified pension plan the us plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date 
the discount rate for our largest foreign plan  the uk qualified pension plan the uk plan  is determined by using a model that discounts each year estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate used in the determination of net periodic pension expense for for both the us plan and the us plan was 
for  the discount rate to be used in the determination of net periodic pension expense for the us plan and the us plan will be and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million for both the us plan and the us plan  and lower the projected benefit obligation of the us plan and uk plan by million and million  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets is based on historical and expected future returns for current and targeted asset allocations for each asset class in the plans investment portfolio  adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results  as compared to the benchmark returns 
when assessing the expected future returns for the portfolio  management places more emphasis on the expected future returns than historical returns 
the expected rate of return used in the determination of net periodic pension expense for was for the us plan and for the us plan 
for  the expected rate of return to be used in the determination of net periodic pension expense for the us plan and the us plan will be 
a increase in the expected rate of return on plan return on assets would decrease annual pension expense for the us plan and uk plan by million and million  respectively 
actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and affect future pension expense 
net pension expense is also based on a market related valuation of plan assets where differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets are amortized to pension expense over a five year period 
we invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the allocations of our us and us pension plan assets at december  and target allocations for are as follows us pension plan uk pension plan allocation of plan assets at december  target allocation allocation of plan assets at december  target allocation equity securities fixed income real estate private equity cash total investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks  which could cause a change in the value of such investment securities 
such a change could have a material impact on our future results 
residual value of leased assets we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
residual value estimates impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as an operating lease or sales type lease 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur and declines in estimated residual values considered other than temporary are recognized immediately 
estimated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed 
if the actual residual value of lease assets were lower than management current estimates  pre tax income would be lower by million 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses we estimate our credit risk for accounts and finance receivables and provide allowances for estimated losses 
we believe that our credit risk is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances for most of our customers and customer geographic and industry diversification 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and evaluate the adequacy of the applicable allowance based on historical loss experience  past due status  adverse situations that may affect a customer ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to the reserves as deemed necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and actual results may differ significantly from estimated reserves 
total allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables was and at december  and  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a increase or decrease in the allowance rate at december  would have changed the provision by approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade receivables was and at december  and  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a increase or decrease in the allowance rate at december  would have changed the provision by approximately million 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates  tax reserve changes and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax laws 
the amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
significant judgment is also required in determining the amount of valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is necessary  and the amount of such allowance  we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
as new information becomes available that would alter our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that will ultimately be realized  we adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings  three to years for machinery and equipment  four to six years for rental equipment and three to five years for computer equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method or an accelerated attrition method over their estimated useful lives  which are principally three to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans and changes to the assets estimated useful lives could have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairment review long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset is compared to the asset carrying amount 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our future long term business plans and historical experience 
if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded for an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is determined using probability weighted expected discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and appraisals  as appropriate 
changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated in our impairment assessment could materially affect the determination of fair value and the associated impairment charge 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  during the fourth quarter  or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step approach 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the reporting unit carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination and the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
significant estimates and assumptions are used in our goodwill impairment review and include the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a combination of techniques  including the present value of future cash flows  applicable multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses  and requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding discount rates  growth rates and our future long term business plans 
changes in any of these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the associated goodwill impairment charge for each reporting unit 
during the third quarter of  as a result of the continuing under performance of our ims operations  and to enable us to better focus on higher growth cross border ecommerce parcel opportunities  we began exploring strategic alternatives to exit the ims operations related to the international delivery of mail and catalogs and concluded it was appropriate to conduct a goodwill impairment review 
we determined the fair value of ims based on negotiations with potential buyers and preliminary indications of interests and written offers received for the ims business  as well applying an income approach with revised cash flow projections 
the inputs used to determine the fair value of the ims operations were classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
based on our review  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and additional impairment charges of million to write down the carrying values of certain intangible and fixed assets associated with the ims business to their respective fair values 
at december   the assets and liabilities of ims were classified as held for sale and all historical amounts related to the ims operations  including the above mentioned goodwill  intangible asset and fixed asset impairment charges  were included in discontinued operations 
in  due to the under performance of our ims operations  management concluded that it was appropriate to perform a goodwill impairment review for ims 
we determined the fair value of ims using a combination of techniques including the present value of future cash flows  multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses  and determined that the ims reporting unit was impaired 
the inputs used to determine the fair value of the ims operations were classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
we allocated the implied fair value to the assets and liabilities of ims and determined the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on our review  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges of million to write down the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the ims business to their respective fair values 
these charges are recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
also in  based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment review process  we determined that the international operations of our management services segment pbmsi were impaired 
we determined the fair value of pbmsi using a combination of techniques including the present value of future cash flows  derived from our long term plans and historical experience  multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses and allocated the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of pbmsi 
the inputs used to determine the fair value of pbmsi were classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
based on our review  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and intangible asset impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets to their respective estimated fair values 
based on the results of our annual impairment review conducted in  the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values  except for pbmsi  whose estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
at december   the goodwill allocated to pbmsi was million 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on projections incorporated in our current operating plans as well as other available information 
the current operating plans included significant assumptions and estimates associated with sales growth  profitability and related cash flows  along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending 
the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit 
we also considered other assumptions that market participants may use 
the inputs used to determine the fair value of pbmsi were classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
by their nature  projections are uncertain 
potential events and circumstances  such as declining volumes  loss of client contracts and inability to acquire new clients could have an adverse effect on our assumptions 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets of pbmsi  and should actual results differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  additional non cash impairment charges for goodwill could be recorded in stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we recognize compensation costs for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock awards using a black scholes valuation model or monte carlo simulation model 
these models require assumptions be made regarding the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life of the award and dividend yield 
the estimate of stock price volatility is based on historical price changes of our stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasuries with a term equal to the expected life of the stock award 
the expected life of the award and expected dividend yield are based on historical experience 
we believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
restructuring we have undertaken restructuring actions which require management to utilize certain estimates related to the amount and timing of expenses 
if the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be impacted 
on a quarterly basis  we update our estimates of future remaining obligations and costs associated with all restructuring actions and compare these updated estimates to our current restructuring reserves  and make adjustments if necessary 
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are routinely defendants in  or party to  a number of pending and threatened legal actions 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess the potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal action is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated  we establish a liability for the estimated loss 
the assessment of the ultimate outcome of each claim or legal action and the determination of the potential financial exposure requires significant judgment 
estimates of potential liabilities for claims or legal actions are based only on information that is available at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we may revise our estimates  and these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item for information regarding our legal proceedings 
other regulatory matters as is the case with other large corporations  we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
except for a dispute arising out of a partnership investment  the irs examinations of tax years prior to are now closed to audit 
we have other domestic and international tax filings currently under examinations or subject to examination 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently undergoing unclaimed property audits  which are being conducted by various state authorities 
the property subject to review in this audit process generally includes unclaimed wages  vendor payments and customer receipts 
state escheat laws generally require entities to report and remit abandoned and unclaimed property 
failure to timely report and remit the property can result in the assessments of additional escheat liability  interest and penalties 
it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits 
foreign currency exchange over the last three years  approximately one third of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside of the united states 
the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency 
our largest foreign currency exposure is to fluctuations in the british pound  euro and canadian dollar  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of countries in which we operate impact our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables between our subsidiaries in different countries 
for the years ended december   and  currency rate movements increased decreased revenue by  and  respectively 
based on the revenue contribution from our international operations in  a increase in the value of the us dollar would have reduced revenue by million 
we use foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy to mitigate our exposure to counterparty credit risk 
we regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts was a net asset of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies 
our objective in managing our exposure to changing interest rates is to limit the volatility and impact of changing interest rates on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and interest rate swaps that convert the fixed rate interest payments on certain debt issuances to variable rates 
at december   approximately of our debt was at variable rates  including the fixed rate debt that has been swapped to variable rate through interest rate swaps 
a one percentage point increase decrease in the effective interest rate of our variable rate debt in would have reduced increased pre tax income by million 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies actively hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt  interest rate derivative contracts and foreign exchange derivative contracts associated with forecasted transactions 
the model excludes all anticipated transactions and firm commitments and account receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
