item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary celgene corporation collectively with its subsidiaries  we  our  us  celgene or the company is a global biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases 
we are dedicated to innovative research and development  designed to bring new therapies to market and are involved in research in several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary next generation therapies  targeting areas such as intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and immune cells  immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases  and therapeutic application of cell therapies 
celgene was incorporated in the state of delaware in our primary commercial stage products include revlimid  vidaza  abraxane  thalomid inclusive of thalidomide celgene  and istodax 
pomalyst pomalidomide was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in february for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies  including lenalidomide and bortezomib  and have demonstrated disease progression on or within days of completion of the last therapy 
revlimid is an oral immunomodulatory drug marketed in the united states and many international markets  in combination with dexamethasone  for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy 
it is also marketed in the united states and certain international markets for the treatment of transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
vidaza is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of dna hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re expression 
vidaza is a category recommended treatment for patients with intermediate and high risk mds  according to the national comprehensive cancer network  and is marketed in the united states for the treatment of all subtypes of mds 
the us regulatory exclusivity for vidaza expired in may if a generic version of vidaza is successfully launched  we may quickly lose a significant portion of our sales for this product in the united states 
in europe  vidaza is marketed for the treatment of intermediate and high risk mds  as well as acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  with blasts and has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of mds and aml 
european regulatory exclusivity is expected to continue through abraxane is a solvent free chemotherapy treatment option for metastatic breast cancer which was developed using our proprietary nab technology platform 
this protein bound chemotherapy agent combines paclitaxel with albumin 
it is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the united states and many international markets and for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer in the united states 
in january  we announced the results from a phase iii trial for abraxane in 
table of contents combination with gemcitabine in treatment na ve patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 
the abraxane combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to patients receiving gemcitabine alone 
based on these results  we plan to submit dossiers for registration in the us and europe during the first half of followed by submissions in other countries and regions during the second half of abraxane is currently in various stages of investigation for the treatment of the following cancers expanded applications for metastatic breast  malignant melanoma  and bladder and ovarian 
in october  the fda approved abraxane for the first line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  in combination with carboplatin  in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy 
the fda approval was based on tumor response rates and did not result in the use of a marketing label that includes a progression free survival claim  and accordingly  the contingent value rights  or cvr  milestone payment  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  has not been achieved 
thalomid  in combination with dexamethasone  is marketed for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum  or enl  an inflammatory complication of leprosy and as maintenance therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of enl recurrence 
istodax is approved in the united states for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma  or ctcl  in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy and for the treatment of peripheral t cell lymphoma  or ptcl  in patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
istodax has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of non hodgkin t cell lymphomas  which includes ctcl and ptcl 
the european medicines agency  or ema  has granted orphan drug designation for istodax for the treatment of both ctcl and ptcl 
pomalyst pomalidomide was approved by the fda in february for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies  including lenalidomide and bortezomib  and have demonstrated disease progression on or within days of completion of the last therapy  and is under review by the ema for use in europe 
pomalyst is a proprietary  distinct  small molecule that is administered orally and modulates the immune system and other biologically important targets 
pomalyst is also being evaluated in a phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of myelofibrosis  in multiple trials in various phases for expanded usage in multiple myeloma  and in a phase ii trial for systemic sclerosis 
additional sources of revenue include royalties from novartis on their sales of focalin xr and the entire ritalin family of drugs  the sale of services through our celgene cellular therapeutics subsidiary  and other licensing agreements 
we continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing clinical proprietary development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates 
revlimid is in several phase iii trials across a range of hematological 
table of contents malignancies that include newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and maintenance  lymphomas  chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  and mds 
phase iii trials with pomalyst in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis  in addition to vidaza for aml  and cc for mds and aml are also underway 
in solid tumors  we are evaluating abraxane in a phase iii trial for metastatic melanoma 
our lead product candidate in inflammation immunology  apremilast  is being evaluated in a broad phase iii program for psoriatic arthritis  psoriasis  and ankylosing spondylitis 
beyond our phase iii programs is a growing early to mid stage pipeline of novel therapies addressing significant unmet medical needs  including cc btk inhibitor  cc dual tork inhibitor  cc dual tork dna pk inhibitor  cc pleiotropic pathway modulator  cc and cc anti inflammatory  pda and pda cellular therapies  in addition to partnered molecules ace actr fusion protein  ace gdf trap  and epz dotl inhibitor

gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 
revlimid is distributed in the united states primarily through contracted pharmacies under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid 
internationally  revlimid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to provide for the product safe and appropriate distribution and use 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
thalomid is distributed in the united states under our proprietary system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  or steps  program which is a comprehensive education and risk management distribution program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
internationally  thalomid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
these programs may vary by country and  
table of contents depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
vidaza  abraxane and istodax are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk management distribution programs as revlimid and thalomid 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
as noted above  revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
the medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to medicaid managed care organizations in march the accrual of the rebates associated with medicaid managed care organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to medicaid managed care organizations 
we have also analyzed actual billings received from certain states to further support the accrual rates 
subsequent to implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  or collectively the us health care reform law  certain states have not yet submitted actual medicaid managed care organization bills  resulting in an increasing accrual balance 
effective january   manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for of the patient cost of branded prescription drugs related to the medicare part d coverage gap 
in order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility  we analyze data for eligible medicare part d patients against data for eligible medicare part d patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices 
this expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred 
in addition  certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and  accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  group purchasing organizations and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices 

table of contents settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from the date of sale 
we provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates 
assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories  contract sales volumes and average contract pricing 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly 
chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
see critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals 
gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands returns and allowances discounts government rebates chargebacks and distributor service fees total balance at december  abraxis balance at october  allowances for sales during credits deductions issued for prior year sales credits deductions issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during prior periods allowances for sales during credits deductions issued for prior year sales credits deductions issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during prior periods allowances for sales during credits deductions issued for prior year sales credits deductions issued for sales during balance at december  
table of contents a comparison of provisions for allowances for sales within each of the four categories noted above for and follows compared to returns and allowances decreased by million in compared  primarily due to the reversal of approximately million in reserves established for certain products with quality issues which were resolved in and lower returns experience on all products  partially offset by a million increase in the returns allowance related to increased levels of vidaza inventory held by distributors at the end of discounts increased by million in compared to  primarily due to revenue increases in the us and international markets  both of which offer different discount programs  and expansion into new international markets 
these amounts were partly offset by rebates related to vidaza sales in the japanese market being included in the chargebacks and distributor service fees category in government rebates increased by million in compared to  primarily due to an increase of approximately million in rebates related to various us programs  partly offset by a million decrease in rebates in certain international markets 
the us programs increase was primarily attributable to volume increases and the refinement of accrual rates for medicaid managed care organizations and medicare part d coverage gap 
the decrease in government rebates of million in international markets was primarily driven by the refinement of select government rebates during the third quarter of chargebacks and distributor service fees increased by million in compared to chargebacks increased by approximately million primarily due to higher sales volumes 
distributor service fees increased by approximately million  primarily due to million in service fees associated with higher sales of abraxane  and million of rebates related to vidaza sales in the japanese market which were included within discounts during the period

these favorable items were partly offset by an increase in the fair value of our liability related to publicly traded cvrs  an increase in payments related to research and development collaboration arrangements and increase in marketing activity  primarily related to prelaunch expenses for pomalyst and abraxane for new indications 
earnings per diluted share were also favorably impacted in by the repurchase of million common shares under our common share repurchase program  reducing our outstanding share base 
net income for reflects the earnings impact from higher sales of revlimid  vidaza and a full year sales of abraxane 
the favorable impact of higher revenues was partly offset by increased spending for new product launches  research and development activities  expansion of our international operations  increase in amortization of intangible assets related to 
table of contents acquisitions and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of senior notes in october earnings per diluted share were also favorably impacted in by the repurchase of million common shares under our common share repurchase program  reducing our outstanding share base 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the components of our financial condition for the years ended december   and in thousands increase decrease versus versus financial assets cash and cash equivalents marketable securities available for sale total financial assets debt short term borrowings long term debt  net of discount total debt working capital includes cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale  accounts receivable  net of allowances  inventory and other current assets  less short term borrowings  accounts payable  accrued expenses  income taxes payable and other current liabilities 
we rely primarily on positive cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from sales of available for sale marketable securities  and borrowings in the form of long term notes payable and short term commercial paper to provide for our liquidity requirements 
we expect continued growth in our expenditures  particularly those related to research and development  clinical trials  commercialization of new products  international expansion and capital investments 
however  we anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  marketable securities available for sale  cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to fund our operating needs  capital expenditures  debt service requirements and our plans to repurchase stock or pursue other strategic business initiatives for the foreseeable future 
many of our operations are conducted outside the united states  and significant portions of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held internationally 
as of december   we held approximately billion of these short term funds in foreign tax jurisdictions 
the amount of funds held in us tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons  such as repurchases of our 
table of contents common stock and business development activities 
as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments  we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows both inflows and outflows 
repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional us federal  state and local income tax payments 
we record us deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings  but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the us  no accrual for us taxes is provided 
during  we concluded that approximately million of our foreign earnings may not be required for use in offshore operations and may be available for use in the united states 
these earnings are no longer treated as permanently reinvested  and accordingly  we recorded a deferred tax liability of million for the estimated us federal and state income taxes that may be incurred should these earnings be repatriated 
the remaining foreign earnings are unremitted and expected to be permanently reinvested outside the us we do not rely on these unremitted earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient current cash resources combined with future cash flows in the united states to fund our us operational and strategic needs 
share repurchase program our board of directors has approved an aggregate billion stock repurchase program of which we have approximately billion remaining for future share repurchases 
during  we used billion for repurchases of our common stock  measured on a settlement date basis 
components of working capital cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale we invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds  us treasury securities  us government sponsored agency securities  us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities  us government agency and supranational securities and global corporate debt securities 
all liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities available for sale 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the time of purchase 
the billion increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale at december  compared to was primarily due to the issuance of billion in senior notes in august and by cash generated from operations  partly offset by billion paid under our share repurchase program  million paid for the acquisition of avila  and a net repayment of million in short term borrowings 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges  is included in interest and investment income  net

accounts receivable  net accounts receivable  net increased by million to million at the end of compared to the impact of increased us and international sales of 
table of contents revlimid  vidaza and abraxane was partly offset by increased collections in certain markets 
sales made outside the united states typically have payment terms that are greater than days  thereby extending collection periods beyond those in the united states 
we expect our accounts receivable balance to continue to grow as our international sales continue to expand 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies  the sovereign debt crisis in certain european countries and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business 
our current business model in these markets is typically to sell our products directly to principally government owned or controlled hospitals  which in turn directly deliver critical care to patients 
our products are used to treat life threatening diseases and we believe this business model enables timely delivery and adequate supply of products 
many of the outstanding receivable balances are related to government funded hospitals and we believe the receivable balances are ultimately collectible 
similarly  we believe that future sales to these customers will continue to be collectible 
the credit and economic conditions within spain  italy  portugal and greece  as well as increasing sales levels in those countries have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable 
our total net receivables in spain  italy and portugal are composed almost entirely of amounts receivable from government owned or controlled hospitals and the public sector and amounted to million in compared to million in approximately million of the million receivable in was greater than one year past due 
our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in greece is limited  as we do not have a material amount of receivables in greece 
we maintain timely and direct communication with hospital customers in spain  italy and portugal regarding both the current and past due receivable balances 
we continue to receive payments from these countries  and closely monitor the plans for payment at the regional government level 
payments from customers in these countries are not received on regular intervals and several months could elapse between significant payments 
this payment pattern was observed in spain earlier in  where a significant portion of aged receivables were paid in late june and early july we also regularly request and receive positive confirmation of the validity of our receivables from most of the regional governmental authorities 
we have the option to pursue legal action against certain of our customers 
in view of the protracted timeline associated with collecting the outstanding balances through legal action and the current direct communication with our customers  in many instances  we do not believe pursuing legal action to be the best approach for any of the parties involved 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts for spain  italy  and portugal  we considered that the balance of past due receivables is related to sales made to government owned or supported customers 
we regularly monitor developments in europe to assess whether the level of risk of default for any customers has increased and note the ongoing efforts by the european union  european monetary union and international monetary fund to support countries with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances 
we also monitor the efforts of individual countries to support their regions with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances 
we have not experienced significant losses or write offs with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable in these countries as a result of their economic difficulties and we do not expect to have write offs or adjustments to accounts receivable which would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents inventory inventory balances increased by million to million at the end of compared to the increase was primarily due to increases in revlimid  vidaza and abraxane inventories  attributable to higher anticipated sales levels 
other current assets other current assets decreased by million to million at the end of compared to primarily due to a million decrease in prepaid taxes and a million decrease in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts  partly offset by an increase in other prepaid accounts 
commercial paper in september  we entered into a commercial paper program  or the program  under which we issue unsecured commercial paper notes  or commercial paper  on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of billion  the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes 
the maturities of the commercial paper may vary  but may not exceed days from the date of issue 
the commercial paper is sold under customary terms to a dealer or in the commercial paper market and is issued at a discount from par or  alternatively  is sold at par and bears varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis 
borrowings under the program are accounted for as short term borrowings 
as of december   million of commercial paper was outstanding bearing an effective interest rate of 
senior unsecured credit facility in september  we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility  or the credit facility  providing for revolving credit in the aggregate amount of billion 
subject to certain conditions  we have the right to increase the amount of the credit facility but in no event more than one time per annum  up to a maximum aggregate amount of billion 
the credit facility has a five year term and amounts may be borrowed for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
the credit facility serves as backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings 
as of december  there was no outstanding borrowing against the credit facility 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including certain customary financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by million to billion at the end of compared to the increase was primarily due to a million reclassification of the liability associated with our publicly traded cvrs from non current to current  a million increase in clinical trial accruals  a million increase in the contingent consideration related to the january avila acquisition and a million increase in accrued interest 
income taxes payable current and non current income taxes payable decreased by million to million at the end of compared to  primarily from tax payments of million  the application of previously refundable prepaid income taxes of million  a tax benefit of stock options of million  net deferred intercompany credits of million offset by the current provision for income taxes of million  which includes a benefit related to tax settlements of million

the non cancelable lease terms for operating leases expire at various dates between and and include renewal options 
in general  we are also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes  insurance  utilities  maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases 
for more information on the major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements refer to part i  item  properties of this annual report on form k 
other contract commitments other contract commitments of million on december  include million in contractual obligations related to product supply contracts 
in addition  we have committed to invest an aggregate million in two investment funds over a ten year period  which is callable at any time 
on december   our remaining investment commitment was million 
collaboration arrangements we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development  manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre established developmental  regulatory and or commercial targets 
our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the 
table of contents programs 
due to the nature of these arrangements  the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development and regulatory approval milestones over a period of several years are inherently uncertain  and accordingly  no amounts have been recorded for these future potential payments in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and contained in this annual report on form k 
potential milestone payments total approximately billion  including approximately billion contingent on the achievement of various research  development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately billion in sales based milestones 
the most significant collaboration agreements are identified in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
new accounting principles in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  or asu asu allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
under that option  a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the company determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
asu is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for periods beginning after september  early adoption is permitted and we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer 
provisions for discounts  early payments  rebates  sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for volume based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale 
the estimated reductions to revenue for such volume based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms  historical experience and trend analysis 
we recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees sales of our products or products using our technologies 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
if royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured  royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received 

table of contents gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
the medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to medicaid managed care organizations in march the accrual of the rebates associated with medicaid managed care organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to medicaid managed care organizations 
we have also analyzed actual billings received from certain states to further support the accrual rates 
subsequent to implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  or collectively the us health care reform law  certain states have not yet submitted actual medicaid managed care organization bills  resulting in an increase in the accrual balance 
effective january   manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for of the patient cost of branded prescription drugs related to the medicare part d coverage gap 
in order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility  we analyze data for eligible medicare part d patients against data for eligible medicare part d patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices 
this expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred 
in addition  certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and  accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  group purchasing organizations and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices 
settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from the date of sale 
we provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates 
assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler 
table of contents inventories  contract sales volumes and average contract pricing 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly 
chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit worthiness of our customers  historical payment patterns  aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions  including publicly available information on the credit worthiness of countries themselves and provinces or areas within such countries where they are the ultimate customers 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the us internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation the cost of share based compensation is recognized in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of all awards granted  using the black scholes method of valuation for stock options 
the fair values of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units are based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is 
table of contents recognized over the service period required to obtain full vesting 
compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security  our intent not to sell  an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis  and issues that raise concerns about the issuer ability to continue as a going concern 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and  if it is  the type of hedging transaction 
for a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period  we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item 
we assess  both at inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments  if any  to current earnings 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
investments in other entities we hold a portfolio of investments in equity securities and certain investment funds that are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method 
investments in companies or certain investment funds over which we have significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method  with our share of earnings or losses reported in other income expense  net 
our cost method and equity method investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
all of our investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment 
if an investment fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is 
table of contents judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances 
factors considered in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include market value or exit price of the investment based on either market quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee  length of time that the market value was below its cost basis  financial condition and business prospects of the investee  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment  issues that raise concerns about the investee ability to continue as a going concern  and any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have three separate three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december   and performance measures for the performance cycle ending in are based on the following components in the last year of the three year cycle on non gaap earnings per share  on non gaap net income  and on total non gaap revenue  as defined 
the performance cycles ending in and are based on the following components on non gaap earnings per share  on total non gaap revenue  as defined  and on relative total shareholder return  which is a measurement of our stock price performance during the year compared with a group of other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant salary for the ltips 
such awards are payable in cash or common stock or a mixture of cash and common stock  which will be determined by the compensation committee at the time of award delivery 
for awards payable in common stock  the number of shares is determined using the average closing price for the trading days prior to the beginning of the cycle 
payments made in common stock are restricted from trading for a period of three years 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award or  if higher  an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control 
accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future non gaap earnings per share  non gaap net income and non gaap revenues  as defined  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals  management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 
valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d we have recorded goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d primarily through the acquisitions of pharmion  gloucester  abraxis and avila 
when identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  are acquired  we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices 
table of contents are not available  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized  but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
we test our goodwill annually for impairment each november we are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value  as determined by our traded share price  as compared to our book value of net assets 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur 
intangible assets related to ipr d product rights are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets 
at that time  we will determine the useful life of the asset  reclassify the asset out of ipr d and begin amortization 
impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
such test entails completing an updated discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the asset 
our existing ipr d product rights were obtained in the acquisitions of gloucester and avila 
the gloucester related product rights will become definite lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for istodax for treatment of ptcl in the european union

valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date  and for each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings in the consolidated statements of income 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of cvrs  adjustments to discount rates and periods  updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
the assumptions related to determining the value of a contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 
our contingent consideration liabilities were acquired in the acquisitions of gloucester  abraxis  and avila

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments

market risk management our revenue and earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments  including derivative instruments such as foreign currency options  foreign currency forward contracts  treasury rate lock agreements and interest rate swap contracts 
foreign currency risk management we have established revenue hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to mitigate volatility in future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates 
through our revenue hedging program  we endeavor to reduce the impact of possible unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates on our future us dollar cash flows that are derived from foreign currency denominated sales 
to achieve this objective  we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated sales that are expected to occur in the foreseeable future  typically no more than three years into the future 
we manage our anticipated transaction exposure principally with foreign currency forward contracts and occasionally foreign currency put and call options 
foreign currency forward contracts we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with non functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries 
the foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at december  and had settlement dates within months 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income loss  or oci  and reclassified to operations in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect operations 
any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income 
table of contents expense  net 
foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at december  and notional amount foreign currency australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen swiss franc total we consider the impact of our own and the counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract on an ongoing basis 
as of december   credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and  accordingly  any changes in their fair value are recognized on the consolidated statements of income in other income expense  net in the current period 
the aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non designated hedging contracts outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively 
although not predictive in nature  we believe a hypothetical threshold reflects a reasonably possible near term change in foreign currency rates 
assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately million 
however  since the contracts either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or relate to assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currencies  any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or re measured through earnings each period along with the underlying asset or liability foreign currency option contracts during  we began hedging a portion of our future foreign currency exposure by utilizing a strategy that involves both a purchased local currency put option and a written local currency call option that are accounted for as hedges of future sales denominated in euros 
specifically  we sell or write a local currency call option and purchase a local currency put option with the same expiration dates and amounts but with different strike prices  this combination of transactions is generally referred to as a collar 
the expiration dates and notional amounts correspond to the amount and timing of forecasted future foreign currency sales 
if the us dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales  the purchased put option value reduces to zero and we benefit from the increase in the us dollar 
table of contents equivalent value of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows  however this benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call  which forms the upper end of the collar 
the premium collected from the call option partially offsets the premium paid for the purchased put option  resulting in a net cost for the collars 
in order to fully offset the net cost of the collars  we also sold local currency put options with a lower strike price and the same expiration dates and amounts as the option contracts that were used to hedge sales 
these written put options introduced risk of loss if the us dollar were to strengthen beyond the strike price of the written put options 
in december  we entered into purchased put options that are not designated as hedges in order to partially offset the risk of loss that would be incurred on the written put options if the us dollar were to strengthen beyond the strike price of the written put 
gains and losses associated with the non hedge put options have been recorded on the income statement as other income expense  net 
foreign currency option contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at december  foreign currency option notional amount designated as hedging activity purchased put written call not designated as hedging activity purchased put written put us dollar notional amounts are calculated as the hedged local currency amount multiplied times the strike value of the foreign currency option 
the local currency notional amounts of our purchased put  and written call that are designated as hedging activity are equal to each other 
although not predictive in nature  we believe a hypothetical threshold reflects a reasonably possible near term change in foreign currency rates 
assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency option contracts that are designated as hedges would change by approximately million 
however  since the foreign currency option contracts designated as hedges hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies  any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or re measured through earnings each period along with the underlying asset or liability 
assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedges would decrease by approximately million if the us dollar were to strengthen  and would increase by approximately million if the us dollar were to weaken 
this impact would be recorded to income during the period during which the change in currency rates occurred 

table of contents interest rate risk management treasury rate lock agreements during  we entered into treasury rate lock agreements  or treasury rate locks  in anticipation of issuing fixed rate notes that were issued in august with the exception of a short period in june when certain outstanding treasury rate locks were not designated as hedges  our treasury rate locks are designated as cash flow hedges and  to the extent effective  any realized or unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in oci and will be recognized in income over the life of the anticipated fixed rate notes 
treasury rate locks were settled during which resulted in losses of million that were recorded to oci 
during the short period in june when we had outstanding treasury rate locks that were not considered hedging instruments  we recorded the change in fair value of million in other income expense  net 
no material amounts were recorded in income during or as a result of hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness 
at december  we had no outstanding treasury rate locks 
interest rate swap contracts from time to time we hedge the fair value of certain debt obligations through the use of interest rate swap contracts 
the interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in interest rates 
since the specific terms and notional amount of the swap are intended to match those of the debt being hedged  it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge and all changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets with no net impact recorded in income 
any net interest payments made or received on interest rate swap contracts are recognized as interest expense 
in  we settled outstanding interest rate swap contracts we entered into with respect to our million fixed notes due in resulting in the receipt of million 
the proceeds from the settlements are being accounted for as a reduction of current and future interest expense associated with these notes 
during  we terminated the hedging relationship on million notional amount of swap contracts that had been entered into earlier in as hedges of our fixed rate notes due in and our fixed rate notes due in by settling certain of the contracts and entering into offsetting contracts for those not settled 
this resulted in gains of million that are being accounted for as a reduction of current and future interest expense associated with these notes 
at december   we were a party to pay floating  receive fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed rate notes 
our swap contracts outstanding at december  consisted of million aggregate notional amount maturing in  which effectively convert a portion of our million  fixed rate notes due in to a floating rate and million aggregate notional amount maturing in  which effectively converts a portion of our billion  fixed rate notes due in to a floating rate 
in january we entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of million related to our fixed rate notes due in and million related to our fixed rate notes due in a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of our debt and interest rate swap contracts from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at december  would have reduced the aggregate fair value of our net payable by million 
a one percentage point decrease at december  would have increased the aggregate fair value of our net payable by million
