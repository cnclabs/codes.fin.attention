basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and management estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and include the accounts of our company  and all of our subsidiaries and vies 
we prepare financial statements in conformity with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information  our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
foreign currency translation our functional currency is united states dollars us  and the functional currency of china net hk is hong kong dollars hk 
the functional currency of our prc operating subsidiary and vies is renminbi rmb  and prc is the primary economic environment in which we operate 
for financial reporting purposes  the financial statements of our prc operating subsidiary and vies  which are prepared using the rmb  are translated into our reporting currency  the united states dollar us dollar 
assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period  and stockholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
the resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
the exchange rates used to translate amounts in rmb into us for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows as of december  balance sheet items  except for equity accounts year ended december  items in the statements of income and comprehensive income  and statements cash flows no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been  or could be converted into us at the above rates 
investment in equity investment affiliates investee companies that are not consolidated  but over which we exercise significant influence  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with asc topic equity method and joint ventures 
whether or not we exercise significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including  among others  representation on the investee companies board of directors and ownership level  which is generally a to interest in the voting securities of the investee companies 
under the equity method of accounting  an investee company s accounts are not reflected within our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and comprehensive income  however  our share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption share of earnings losses in equity investment affiliates in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
our carrying value including advance to the investees in equity method investee companies is reflected in the caption investment in and advance to equity investment affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets 
when our carrying value in an equity method investee company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated financial statements unless we guaranteed obligations of the investee company or have committed additional funding 
when the investee company subsequently reports income  we will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries 
goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the test consists of two steps 
first  identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
second  if there is impairment identified in the first step  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
deconsolidation we accounted for deconsolidation of subsidiaries in accordance with asc topic consolidation 
in accordance with asc topic  the parent shall account for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary by recognizing a gain or loss in net income attributable to the parent  measured as the difference between a 
the aggregate of all of the following the fair value of any consideration received  the fair value of any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated  the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest in the former subsidiary including any accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interest at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
b 
the carrying amount of the former subsidiary s assets and liabilities 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary we accounted for changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary in accordance with asc topic consolidation  subtopic  which requires the transaction be accounted for as equity transactions investments by owners and distributions to owners acting in their capacity as owners 
therefore  no gain or loss shall be recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income 
the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in its ownership interest in the subsidiary 
any difference between the fair value of the consideration received or paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted shall be recognized in equity attributable to the parent and reallocated the subsidiary s accumulated comprehensive income  if any  among the parent and the noncontrolling interest through an adjustment to the parent s equity 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with asc topic in accordance with asc topic  revenues are recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the service has been rendered  iii the fees are fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
sales include revenues from reselling of advertising time purchased from tv stations  internet advertising and providing related value added technical services  reselling of internet advertising spaces and other advertisement related resources 
no revenue from advertising for advertising barter transactions was recognized because the transactions did not meet the criteria for recognition in asc topic  subtopic advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
value added technical services are provided based on two types of contracts i fixed price and ii fixed price with minimum performance threshold 
for contracts with fixed price term  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the engaged service period 
for fixed price contracts with minimum performance threshold  revenue is recognized when the specified performance criteria is met 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectability is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from customers  only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
taxation income tax we adopt asc topic income taxes and use liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 
we adopt asc topic through and  which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and income tax disclosures 
for the years ended december  and  we did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions

these amended standards permit an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
for assets in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  the asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
however  this asu requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  for public entities 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adoption

internet advertising revenues for the year ended december  were approximately us million as compared to us million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
the increase in internet advertising revenue for the year ended december  was due to the addition of the internet advertising revenue generated by sou yi lian mei of approximately us million  resulting from the and equity interest acquisition in sou yi lian mei in december and september  respectively 
the internet advertising revenue generated by the other operating vies of approximately us million for the year ended december  decreased by approximately as compared to us million in internet advertising revenue generated in the same period of this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average internet advertising spending per customer caused by the general decline of china s economy beginning in the second quarter of  continued into fiscal revenues generated from technical services offered by rise king wfoe were us million for the year ended december   as compared to us million for the same period in due to the chinese government s monetary policy of increasing interest rates and tightening the money supply  economic difficulties began in the second quarter of  which only recovered slightly in fiscal with no significant improvement in the overall economy 
in response to the overall economic downturn in china  and from the second half of  the majority of our clients cancelled the subscription of these services and only continued their basic internet advertising service  which was recorded in as our internet advertising revenue discussed above and reduced their advertising spending significantly 
our tv advertising revenue increased significantly to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period in we generated this us million of tv advertising revenue for the year ended december  by selling approximately  minutes of advertising time purchased from different provincial tv stations as compared with approximately  minutes of advertising time that we sold in the same period of this increase in tv advertising time selling was due to enhanced cooperation with the tv station responsible for launching the entrepreneurial reality show  which is based on the same concept and premise as the hit tv game show shark tank in the us this show is intended to get the general public to visit our website  chuanye 
com and create additional traffic on our two advertising portals  com and liansuo 
com  and in return to monetize more branded larger size small and medium enterprises to subscribe our services while securing our competitive advantage in the tv business segment against our competitors with more time purchased in as compared with the tv show is considered to be an alternative economic resource to obtain internet traffic to our web portals as the costs associated with our internet resources are increasing year over year and tv cost has a relatively lower rate of increase 
however  due to the regular chinese new year holiday which takes place in the first quarter of each fiscal year and is always considered to the slowest time of the year  and the economic downturn happened from the second half of  which continued to  we had to combine the time slots of the first quarter of the year at cost with other quarter s available time slots sales in order to counter off the deficiency in sales margin incurred during this time of the year 
as a result of such combination  we achieved only gross profit rate for this segment in the first quarter of  this situation was improved in the following quarters of with our gross profit rate of this business segment improved to for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we earned approximately us million of revenue from the bank kiosk business segment as compared to approximately us million for the same period in the decrease in advertising revenue from the bank kiosk business was a result of the decline of the general economy in china  which caused a significant reduction in our customers overall advertising spending as discussed above 
the bank kiosk advertising business is not intended to expand at the moment as management s main focus is on expanding internet business 
therefore  it was not a significant contributor to revenue for either year ended december  or management currently maintains this business without any expansion plans and some of the technology used in this business unit will be fully integrated into the overall advertising and marketing platform 
for the year ended december   we achieved approximately us million service revenue from our brand management and sales channel building segment as compared to us million service revenue generated in the same period of the increase in the revenue from this business segment was primarily due to the increase in the average brand advertising and marketing spending per customer from larger sized and ex exporting customers acquired for the year ended december  as a result of our further expansion of our client base for this business segment in cost of revenues our cost of revenue consisted of costs directly related to the offering of our advertising services  technical services  marketing services and brand management and sales channel building services

we purchased these internet resources from other well known portal websites in china  for example  baidu  sohu and tecent qq 
our purchasing of these internet resources in large volumes allowed us to negotiate discounts with our suppliers 
the majority of the resources purchased were used by the internet advertising unit to attract more internet traffic to our advertising portals  assist our internet advertisement clients to obtain more diversified exposure and to generate more visits to their advertisements and mini sites placed on our portal websites  which result in potential sales leads 
for the year ended december  and  our total cost of sales for internet advertising revenue was us million and us million  respectively

restricted net assets as most of our operations are conducted through our prc subsidiary and vies  our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions of funds from our prc subsidiary and vies 
relevant prc statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by our prc subsidiary and vies only out of their retained earnings  if any  as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations and after it has met the prc requirements for appropriation to statutory reserves 
paid in capital of the prc subsidiary and vies included in our consolidated net assets are also not distributable for dividend purposes 
in accordance with the prc regulations on enterprises with foreign investment  a wfoe established in the prc is required to provide certain statutory reserves  namely general reserve fund  the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the enterprise s prc statutory accounts 
a wfoe is required to allocate at least of its annual after tax profit to the general reserve until such reserve has reached of its registered capital based on the enterprise s prc statutory accounts 
appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the board of directors 
the aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends 
rise king wfoe is subject to the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits 
additionally  in accordance with the company law of the prc  a domestic enterprise is required to provide a statutory common reserve of at least of its annual after tax profit until such reserve has reached of its registered capital based on the enterprise s prc statutory accounts 
a domestic enterprise is also required to provide for a discretionary surplus reserve  at the discretion of the board of directors 
the aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends 
all of our prc vies are subject to the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits 
as a result of these prc laws and regulations  our prc subsidiary and vies are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us 
as of december  and  net assets restricted in the aggregate  which includes paid in capital and statutory reserve funds of our prc subsidiary and vies that are included in our consolidated net assets  was approximately us million and us million  respectively 
the new prc enterprise income tax eit law  which was effected on january   also imposed a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside china  which were exempted under the previous eit law 
a lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland china and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company 
holding companies in hong kong  for example  will be subject to a rate 
rise king wfoe is invested by its immediate holding company in hong kong and will be entitled to the preferential withholding tax rate upon distribution of the dividends to its immediate holding company 
the ability of our prc subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to us may also be restricted by changes in applicable foreign exchange and other laws and regulations 
foreign currency exchange regulation in china is primarily governed by the following rules foreign exchange administration rules  as amended in august  or the exchange rules  administration rules of the settlement  sale and payment of foreign exchange  or the administration rules 
currently  under the administration rules  renminbi is freely convertible for current account items  including the distribution of dividends  interest payments  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not for capital account items  such as direct investments  loans  repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of china  unless the prior approval of the state administration of foreign exchange the safe is obtained and prior registration with the safe is made 
foreign invested enterprises like rise king wfoe that need foreign exchange for the distribution of profits to its shareholders may effect payment from their foreign exchange accounts or purchase and pay foreign exchange rates at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders by producing board resolutions for such profit distribution 
based on their needs  foreign invested enterprises are permitted to open foreign exchange settlement accounts for current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized accounts for capital account receipts and payments of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks 
although the current exchange rules allow the convertibility of chinese renminbi into foreign currency for current account items  conversion of chinese renminbi into foreign exchange for capital items  such as foreign direct investment  loans or securities  requires the approval of safe  which is under the authority of the people s bank of china 
these approvals  however  do not guarantee the availability of foreign currency conversion 
we cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain all required conversion approvals for our operations or the chinese regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of chinese renminbi in the future 
currently  most of our retained earnings are generated in renminbi 
any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use retained earnings generated in renminbi to make dividends or other payments in us dollars or fund possible business activities outside china 
as of december  and  there were approximately us million and us million retained earnings in the aggregate  respectively  which were generated by our prc subsidiary and vies in renminbi included in our consolidated net assets  aside from us million and us million statutory reserve funds as of december  and  respectively  that may be affected by increased restrictions on currency exchanges in the future and accordingly may further limit our prc subsidiary or vies ability to make dividends or other payments in us dollars to us  in addition to the approximately us million and us million restricted net assets as of december  and  respectively  as discussed above
