liquidity and capital resources edc has a history of profitability and positive cash flow 
we can continue to grow with minimal additional capital requirements 
our primary source of cash is generated from operations 
outside of cash used in operating activities  generally our primary uses of cash are to pay dividends and acquire treasury stock 
during fiscal year  we have utilized our bank credit facility to meet some short term cash requirements 
we expect our ongoing cash flow to continue to exceed cash required to operate the business 
consequently  we expect to pay down our short term borrowings during fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced a positive cash flow from operations of  cash flow from net earnings of  was increased due to the provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of  a decrease in inventories of  and depreciation expense of  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  a  increase in net income tax receivable  a decrease in deferred income taxes of  a decrease in current liabilities of  and a  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
cash used in investing activities was  due to an additional  investment in demibooks and  for capital expenditures 
we estimate that cash used in investing activities for fiscal year will be less than  this would consist of software and hardware enhancements to our existing data processing equipment  property improvements and additional warehouse equipment 
cash used in financing activities was  which was primarily due to dividend payments of   payments under our revolving credit agreement  and  paid to acquire treasury stock 
these were offset by cash received of  from borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and  from the sale of treasury stock 
in september  the board of directors authorized a minimum annual cash dividend of of net earnings 
in fiscal years and  we declared dividends equal to and  respectively  of net earnings 
our board of directors adopted a stock repurchase plan in which we may purchase up to an additional  shares as market conditions warrant 
management believes the stock is undervalued and when stock becomes available at an attractive price  we can utilize free cash flow to repurchase shares 
management believes this enhances the value to the remaining stockholders and that these repurchases will have no adverse effect on our short term and long term liquidity

contractual obligations we are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide this information 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our valuation of inventory  allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable  allowance for sales returns  long lived assets and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  however  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies to be more significantly dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation whereby share based payment transactions with employees  such as stock options and restricted stock  are measured at estimated fair value at date of grant and recognized as compensation expense 
revenue recognition sales are recognized and recorded when products are shipped 
products are shipped fob shipping point 
the ubam division s sales are paid at the time the product is shipped 
these sales accounted for of net revenues in both fiscal years and estimated allowances for sales returns are recorded as sales are recognized and recorded 
management uses a moving average calculation to estimate the allowance for sales returns 
we are not responsible for product damaged in transit 
damaged returns are primarily from the retail stores 
the damages occur in the stores  not in shipping to the stores 
it is industry practice to accept returns from wholesale customers 
transportation revenue  the amount billed to the customer for shipping the product  is recorded when products are shipped 
management has estimated and included a reserve for sales returns of  as of both february  and february  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  customers financial conditions and current economic trends 
management has estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of february  and february   respectively 

table of contents inventory management continually estimates and calculates the amount of non current inventory 
the inventory arises due to occasional purchases of book inventory in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle due to minimum order requirements of our primary supplier 
noncurrent inventory was estimated by management using the current year turnover ratio by title 
all inventory in excess of years of anticipated sales was classified as noncurrent inventory 
noncurrent inventory balances were  and  at february  and february   respectively 
inventories are presented net of a valuation allowance 
management has estimated and included a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory 
this allowance is based on management s identification of slow moving inventory on hand 
management has estimated a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory of  and  as of february  and february   respectively 
our product line contains approximately  titles  each with different rates of sale  depending upon the nature and popularity of the title 
almost all of our product line is saleable as the books are not topical in nature and remain current in content today as well as in the future 
most of our products are printed in europe  china  singapore  india  malaysia and dubai resulting in a three to four month lead time to have a title reprinted and delivered to us 
our principal supplier  based in england  generally requires a minimum reorder of  or more of a title in order to get a solo print run 
smaller orders would require a shared print run with the supplier s other customers  which can result in more lengthy delays to receive the ordered title 
anticipating customer preferences and purchasing habits requires historical analysis of similar titles in the same series 
we then place the initial order or re order based upon this analysis 
these factors and historical analysis have led management to determine that years represents a reasonable estimate of the normal operating cycle for our products 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues new accounting standards in a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting 
we have reviewed the recently issued pronouncements and concluded that the recently issued accounting standards are not applicable to us
