item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations constitutes management s review of the factors that affected our financial and operating performance for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a development stage company and began the development of the mt 
hope project on october  during the year ended december  we also completed work on a pre feasibility study of our liberty property  which we updated during project ownership from october to january  we owned the rights to of the mt 
hope project 
effective as of january   we contributed all of our interest in the assets related to the mt 
hope project  including our lease of the mt 
hope project into eureka moly  llc the llc  and in february entered into an agreement llc agreement for the development and operation of the mt 
hope project with pos minerals 
under the llc agreement  pos minerals owns a interest in the llc and general moly  through nevada moly  llc nevada moly  a wholly owned subsidiary  owns an interest 
the ownership interests and or required capital contributions under the llc agreement can change as discussed below 
pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  pos minerals made its first and second capital contributions to the llc totaling million during the year ended december  initial contributions 
additional amounts were due from pos minerals within days after the date rod contribution date that specified conditions rod contribution conditions were satisfied 
the rod contribution conditions were i the receipt of major operating permits for the mt 
hope project  ii confirmation that the record of decision rod from the united states bureau of land management blm for the mt 
hope project had become effective  and iii any administrative or judicial appeals with respect thereto are final 
the rod became effective november  and the satisfaction of the other rod contribution conditions occurred in december pos minerals made the third capital contribution installment of million on december  furthermore  an additional payment of million was made representing pos minerals share of all costs incurred for the development of the mt 
hope project during the period from through october in addition  as commercial production at the mt 
hope project was not achieved by december  the llc will be required to return to pos minerals million of its capital contributions to the llc  with no corresponding reduction in pos minerals ownership percentage 
this return of contributions payment will be due days after the commencement of commercial production  as defined in the llc agreement 
based on our current plan  we anticipate commercial production will be achieved in mid nevada moly is obligated under the terms of the llc agreement to make capital contributions to the llc to fund the return of contributions to pos minerals upon achievement of commercial production ie when the contingency is resolved 
if nevada moly does not fund their additional capital contribution in order for the llc to return to pos minerals million of its total capital contribution  pos minerals has an election to either make a secured loan to the llc to fund the return of contributions  or receive an additional interest in the llc of approximately 
in the latter case  our nevada moly s interest in the llc is subject to dilution by a percentage equal to the ratio of times the amount of the unpaid contributions over the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions as determined under the llc agreement of both parties to the llc dilution formula 
at december   the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions of both parties was  million 
furthermore  the llc agreement permits pos minerals to put its interest in the llc to nevada moly after a change of control of nevada moly or the company  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by a failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with the development and operation of the mt 
hope project as contemplated by the parties for a period of twelve consecutive months 
if pos minerals puts its interest  nevada moly or its transferee or surviving entity would be required to purchase the interest for of pos minerals total contributions to the llc plus interest per annum 
beginning in november  the company and pos minerals began making monthly pro rata capital contributions to the llc to fund costs incurred as required by the llc agreement 
the interest of a party in the llc that does not make its monthly pro rata capital contributions to fund costs incurred after the rod contribution date is subject to dilution based on the dilution formula 

table of contents permitting completion and project restart on november   the us bureau of land management blm issued its record of decision rod authorizing development of the mt 
hope project 
the rod approves the plan of operations poo for construction and operation of the mining and processing facilities and also grants the rights of way for a kv power transmission line  discussed below 
monitoring and mitigation measures identified in the rod developed in collaboration with the regulatory agencies involved throughout the permitting process will avoid  minimize  and mitigate environmental impacts  and reflect the company s commitment to operate the mt 
hope project to the highest environmental standards 
the state of nevada division of environmental protection ndep issued a reclamation permit for the mt 
hope project on november   which authorizes surface disturbance and construction of facilities 
the reclamation permit also approves the reclamation cost estimate of approximately million and established bonding requirements based on this estimate 
on december   blm accepted the llc s reclamation surety bonding for the mt 
hope project 
the surety bond program has been funded with an initial cash payment of million and requires additional cash funding of million through the construction process for a total of million which is in alignment with the net cash bonding cost included in the august capital estimate 
this total covers the first three years of estimated surface disturbance at mt 
hope  and is subject to ongoing evaluation thereafter 
with the surety program in place and the initial contribution funded  the blm has authorized that surface disturbance in conformity with the rod may proceed 
on november   ndep issued a water pollution control permit wpc for the mt 
hope project 
the permit also approves the operational and closure plans for the mt 
hope project  and establishes monitoring requirements 
the llc initiated cultural clearance activities at the mt 
hope project in early december upon receipt of an archaeological resource protection act permit issued by the state archeologist at the nevada state office of the blm 
cultural clearance is an important component of the llc s commitment to environmental protection and will be completed before major earthworks are done in any of the construction areas 
the llc will concentrate on clearing priority areas for initial construction and then continue mitigation throughout the disturbance footprint 
use of this phased approach will allow the llc to maintain uninterrupted construction progress after initial clearance work is completed 
on january   the public utilities commission of nevada pucn granted the llc s permit to construct a kv power line that interconnects with nevada energy s transmission system at the existing machacek substation located near the town of eureka  nv and extend it approximately miles to the planned mt 
hope substation 
in addition  the blm notified the llc that its surety bonds were approved for reclamation estimates concerning rights of way grants for the kv power transmission line 
this permit allows the llc to build the transmission infrastructure in a timely manner and provide the necessary capacity to power construction activities and mt 
hope project operations 
construction of the transmission line will also include upgrades to the existing substation near eureka that will improve the reliability of electrical power to the community 
at full production the mt 
hope project will have a total electrical demand load of approximately megawatts 
transmission capacity was secured in and the llc is currently negotiating for generating capacity  which will be available once the power line is constructed and energized 
on january   the federal energy regulatory commission approved an energy procurement and construction agreement contract between nv energy and mt 
wheeler power 
in turn  in early january  the llc put in place a contract with mt 
wheeler power to provide electricity generating capacity to the mt 
hope project 
the scope is to design and install the interconnect facility at the machacek substation  near the town of eureka  to connect the llc s future kv power line to the utility 
the llc initiated preliminary construction activities in early january including early well field development and clearing and grubbing of terrain that coincide with the llc s ongoing cultural clearance efforts at the mt 
hope project 
the initial focus will be on clearing the administrative office and mill site areas as well as clearing the water pipeline corridors in preparation for developing the well field and water distribution system to support heavy construction activities 
capital operating estimates in october of  we completed a review of the capital cost requirements for the mt 
hope project  based on current major equipment  labor and material pricing and further engineering definition 
the project capital was also updated for currently known permitting and regulatory requirements and includes the schedule impacts of permitting delays since the september feasibility study update  which was reconfirmed in november the mt 
hope project has not materially changed in scope and is currently designed at approximately engineering completion with solid scope definition 
the updated capital cost estimate increased by  or million  and totaled  million as of december  the largest affected category of the revised estimate was owners cost  which increased  or million  driven by schedule delays largely attributed to an extended permitting timeline 
of that amount  million represents holding costs over the to period approximately million per month  that were not envisioned in the original project estimates 
as such  while they are included in the overall project total  they do not contribute directly to the development of the project 
these amounts do not include financing costs or amounts necessary to fund operating 
table of contents working capital and potential capital overruns 
the llc has incurred costs of approximately million in the development of the mt 
hope project through december  the llc s project operating cost estimate forecasts molybdenum production of approximately million pounds per year for the first five years of operations at estimated average direct operating costs of per pound  based on per barrel oil equivalent energy prices 
the costs applicable to sales cas per pound  including anticipated royalties calculated at a market price of per pound molybdenum  are anticipated to average per pound 
for a reconciliation of direct operating costs  a non gaap measure  to cas  see production above 
we currently estimate that  for each per barrel change in oil equivalent energy costs  the mt 
hope project s direct operating costs will change by approximately per pound 
these cost estimates are based on constant dollars and are subject to cost inflation or deflation 
in the past several years  operating costs in the mining industry have escalated on a world wide basis as a result of major factors beyond our control  including the cost of energy and labor 
we anticipate updating these operating cost estimates later in equipment and supply procurement the llc began a slow procurement and engineering restart in early designed to conserve cash while maintaining project schedule in order to maximize financial flexibility until its major permits were acquired 
the llc continues to take a cautious approach with preliminary construction activities until the company completes documentation and receives funding of its term loan 
through december   the llc has made deposits of million on equipment orders  has spent approximately million for the development of the mt 
hope project and has paid million into an escrow arrangement for electricity transmission services 
based on commitments as of the end of  we expect to make additional payments on wellfield materials and milling process equipment orders of approximately million in and million in on february   the llc issued a firm purchase order for haul trucks 
the order provides for delivery of those haul trucks required to perform initial mine development  currently scheduled for late or early a non refundable down payment of million was made at the time of order with an additional million paid in december  months prior to anticipated truck shipment  but the contract is cancellable with no further liability to the llc up until the time of truck shipment 
on june   the llc issued a firm purchase order for mine production drills 
a non refundable down payment of million was made in december the contract remains cancellable with no further liability to the llc until the time the drills are shipped 
at june   the llc s contract to purchase two electric shovels expired 
we signed a new letter of intent with the vendor providing for the opportunity to purchase the electric shovels at prices consistent with the expired contract  less a special discount in the amount of million to provide credit to the llc for amounts paid as deposits under the expired contract 
the agreement provides that equipment pricing will remain subject to inflation indexes and guarantees production slots to ensure that the equipment is available when required by the llc 
agreements with hanlong usa mining investment inc we have signed a series of agreements the hanlong transaction with hanlong usa mining investment  inc hanlong  an affiliate of sichuan hanlong group  a large privately held chinese company 
the agreements described below form the basis of a million transaction that is intended to provide the company with adequate capital to contribute its share of costs to develop the mt 
hope project 
the agreements include a a securities purchase agreement that provides for the sale to hanlong of shares of our common stock in two tranches that will aggregate of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis for million million per tranche  conditioned upon us receiving permits for the mt 
hope project and hanlong s use of commercially reasonable efforts to procure a million loan from a prime chinese bank for our use in constructing the mt 
hope project  b a stockholder agreement that provides hanlong representation on our board of directors board and the llc management committee  governs how hanlong will vote its shares of the company and limits hanlong s ability to purchase or dispose of our securities  c a bridge loan whereby hanlong will provide up to million to the company to preserve liquidity until permits are received and the term loan is available  d a subordinated debt agreement whereby hanlong will provide up to million to assist the company in financing capital cost increases  and e a long term molybdenum supply off take agreement discussed further in item a below which requires hanlong to purchase the company s entire share of the mt 
hope project s molybdenum production above that necessary for the company to meet its existing supply commitments until the expiration of those commitments 

table of contents the securities purchase agreement purchase agreement stock purchase 
the purchase agreement provides  subject to its terms and conditions  for the purchase by hanlong of million of our common stock  or approximately million shares  which will equal of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
the purchase agreement has been amended five times including july  amendment extending the deadline for obtaining chinese government approvals by two months to october   as well as extending the company s deadline for publishing its deis and receiving its rod rod condition to february   and november   respectively 
hanlong has received chinese government approvals for its equity investment in us and our deis was published  an october  amendment setting the closing of hanlong s purchase of the first million tranche of equity for december  and eliminating the condition that required us to have our deis published prior to closing this funding  a december  amendment that made certain non substantive changes in connection with the closing of the first tranche of hanlong s equity investment tranche  a july  amendment that eliminated the deadline for publication of the deis  extended the rod deadline from november  to the earlier of nine months following deis publication or september   extended hanlong s commitment to make available the term loan from two months following rod to nine months following the rod  provided the ability for the company to extend the rod condition date to the earlier of months following deis publication and december  rod condition extension  and extended the maturity date of the bridge loan to the earlier of i days after the issuance of the rod  ii the date on which the purchase agreement terminates  and iii the earlier of december  and the availability of the term loan  and a june  amendment that provided notice to hanlong that the company did not expect the blm to issue the rod before september  but did expect the rod to be issued prior to december  and further provided notice that the company wished to utilize the rod condition extension  thereby amending the date by which the rod must be issued to december  the rod became effective on november   thereby fulfilling the company s requirements under the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement may be terminated by either party providing the terminating party is not in default if the closing of the second tranche tranche has not occurred on or before the earlier of december  or months after the issuance of the rod 
as discussed above  the second tranche will be for a purchase price of an additional million 
remaining conditions significant to the closing of tranche require the completion of documentation for and satisfaction of conditions precedent for the availability of funding under the term loan  described below 
hanlong will have the right to purchase a portion of any additional shares of common stock that we may issue during the term of the purchase agreement so that it can maintain its percentage ownership  unless its ownership is at the time below at the earlier of the closing of tranche or closing of the term loan 
it may also acquire additional shares so that it maintains a indirect interest in the mt 
hope project if our interest in the llc is reduced below 
if we issue shares to fund the mt 
hope project under certain circumstances  and on or before the date of commercial production  and hanlong exercises its rights to maintain its percentage interest  we will be obligated to refund to hanlong the cost of such shares over a three year period up to an aggregate of million 
break fees 
a break fee is payable by both the company and hanlong if the purchase agreement terminates because of the failure of certain conditions 
a break fee of million is payable to the company if the purchase agreement is terminated because hanlong fails to obtain necessary chinese government approvals  which may be offset against any balances owed by the company under the bridge loan 
a break fee of million is payable to hanlong if the purchase agreement is terminated and the company has violated the no shop provisions of the purchase agreement 
on january   the company and hanlong executed an option agreement concerning the payment date for the rod extension fee under the purchase agreement for no consideration 
the option was exercised on june   thereby amending the purchase agreement to extend payment of the million rod extension fee from december to april  as the achievement of rod by the september  deadline did not occur  a million rod extension fee has been accrued as of december   and is included in capitalized debt issuance costs 
this fee will be credited against the arrangement fee described below 
in addition  the break fee was increased by million at the time the option was exercised 
therefore  the maximum amount of potential break fees payable by the company is million 
the break fee payable by the company to hanlong may be paid in cash  or  in certain circumstances  in shares of our common stock at our option 
if paid in shares  the price would be the volume weighted average of our common stock on the nyse mkt for the five days ending six days after the announcement of the termination 

table of contents stockholder agreement in connection with hanlong s purchase of our shares  hanlong signed a stockholder agreement with the company that limits hanlong s future acquisitions of our common stock  provides for designation of up to two directors to our board and representation on the llc management committee  and places some restrictions on hanlong s voting and disposition of our shares 
after the tranche closing  hanlong became entitled to nominate one director to serve on our board and one representative to the llc management committee 
nelson chen currently serves in both of these capacities 
after the tranche closing  hanlong will be entitled to nominate a second director 
the company will include and recommend the election of hanlong s nominees in the board s slate of nominees submitted to our stockholders  subject to the board s fiduciary obligations concerning nomination of directors and compliance by the nominee with applicable law and company requirements concerning disclosure of information 
the hanlong nominees may also serve on committees for which they are eligible 
hanlong has agreed not to purchase additional shares  except as permitted by the purchase agreement  without the company s prior consent  and has agreed that it will not solicit proxies  join a group with respect to our equity securities  solicit or encourage an offer from another person for the company  call a meeting of the company s stockholders or make a proposal to the company s stockholders  except to the board 
if our board receives an offer for the company  for its assets or a merger that the board determines is in the best interests of the company s stockholders  hanlong is required to vote in favor of such a transaction or tender its shares unless it proposes an alternative transaction that our board determines is more favorable to our stockholders than the offer received 
hanlong may not  without the prior written consent of the board  transfer ownership of their securities if the recipient would acquire beneficial ownership of more than of our common stock as of the date of such transfer 
the restrictions on hanlong s share ownership  voting  disposition and drag along rights will terminate on the earlier of the time that hanlong owns less than of our common stock  the date that is months after the date that commercial production begins at the mt 
hope project  and june  bridge loan hanlong agreed to provide a million bridge loan to the company  available in two equal million tranches 
on april   we drew down the first million tranche 
the second tranche became available after receiving stockholder approval of the hanlong transaction 
the first tranche of the bridge loan bears interest at a rate tie to the london interbank offered rate libor plus per annum 
the second tranche of the bridge loan will bear interest at per annum and is undrawn 
the bridge loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the term loan 
the second tranche may also be repaid at the company s election  in shares of the company s common stock 
if paid in shares  the price would be the volume weighted average of the company s shares on the nyse mkt for a five day period after public announcement of the event that required repayment 
the company may offset its right to receive the break fee against its obligations to repay borrowings under the bridge loan 
on january   the company and hanlong executed a second option agreement concerning the bridge loan agreement 
on june   the company exercised the option  thereby amending the bridge loan agreement for no consideration to extend the maturity date of the bridge loan from december  until april  this option also has the effect of potentially extending the availability of the undrawn million second tranche to april  since the availability of the second tranche ends the earliest of the tranche closing date  the maturity date of the bridge loan and the first borrowing under the term loan 
the outstanding balance of the bridge loan and related accrued interest are recorded as a current liability as of december  as the latest available maturity date of the bridge loan is april  the bridge loan and our obligation to pay a break fee to hanlong under the purchase agreement are secured by a pledge by us of a interest in the llc 
chinese bank term loan hanlong is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to procure a term loan in an amount of at least million 
the term loan is expected to bear interest at libor plus a spread of between and per annum 
the purchase agreement provides that the term loan will have customary covenants and conditions  however  the terms of the term loan have not yet been negotiated with the lender and we have no assurance as to the final terms of the term loan 
on february   the company announced china development bank cdb had confirmed the basic terms underlying a proposed million term loan to finance the company s share of development costs for the mt 
hope project  including a cdb intention to lend million and arrange a consortium of chinese and international banks to fund the balance of million 
the term loan is anticipated to carry a maturity of years including a month grace period to allow for the construction of the mt 
hope project 
the interest rate will remain subject to market conditions and chinese government policy 
the company and hanlong are continuing to work with cdb with a target of having the loan completed  approved and available to the company by mid hanlong or an affiliate is obligated to guarantee the term loan 
when funds can be drawn by the company under the term loan  the company will pay a million arrangement fee to hanlong who will pay fees and expenses associated with the term loan before the term loan closing  including those charged by the chinese bank 

table of contents hanlong subordinated debt facility on october   the company and hanlong signed a subordinated debt agreement sub debt facility under which hanlong agreed to provide  with a six month option to arrange a third party credit facility  up to million to assist the company in financing capital cost increases  which are discussed in capital and operating estimates above 
under the sub debt facility  hanlong will lend in two tranches 
tranche a in the amount of million will be available to the company during the mt 
hope project s construction period after full advance of the term loan 
tranche b  in the amount of million  will be available during the six month period following the commencement of commercial production 
tranche a of the sub debt facility can be reduced to the extent equipment is leased for the mt 
hope project by the llc 
in exchange for arranging the sub debt facility  the company will pay a fee to hanlong of million  payable at the earlier of the first draw under the term loan  upon receiving funds associated with the exercise of hanlong s warrants  described below  or other financing of at least million  or october   if the sub debt facility is in effect 
simultaneously with the execution of the sub debt facility  the company issued a warrant to hanlong with a year maturity to purchase ten million shares of the company s common stock 
the warrant is priced at a premium to the day volume weighted average price on the issuance date  which results in a price of per share  and becomes exercisable on april  a value of million has been placed on the warrant 
this amount has been recorded as loan commitment fees as of december  and will be expensed ratably over the life of the loan 
following the close of the tranche purchase of stock under the purchase agreement and an exercise of the issued warrant  hanlong would own approximately of our outstanding shares 
both tranches of the sub debt facility will mature years after the achievement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project and will require mandatory prepayment of of the company s semi annual net free cash flow after debt service payments on the term loan and any other mt 
hope project funding requirements 
the sub debt facility will be subordinated to the term loan and will bear interest at month libor plus  with interest paid semi annually 
the sub debt facility has covenants that are customary for subordinated credit facilities and will contain additional covenants required to effect subordination to the term loan satisfactory to the holders of the term loan 
advances under the sub debt facility are subject to a number of conditions precedent  such as accuracy of representations and warranties  compliance with covenants  absence of default and full advance of the term loan 
in connection with the sub debt facility  the company and hanlong entered into amendment no 
to the above described stockholder agreement on october  the amendment provides that the warrant or shares issued pursuant to the warrant will not be included in the calculation of hanlong s beneficial ownership under provisions of the stockholder agreement or other agreements entered into by the company and hanlong prior to october  the amendment also provides that the warrant and shares issued pursuant to the warrant will be subject to the rights and restrictions of the stockholder agreement with the exception of restrictions on disposition  pledges and encumbrances 
molybdenum market update the worldwide molybdenum price fluctuated between per pound in to over per pound in and traded in the mid s per pound prior to october  when prices fell from approximately per pound to per pound in april as a result of the global economic collapse 
subsequent to april  prices slowly rose  finishing at per pound and further increasing to finish at per pound 
during  prices traded in a relatively narrow range finishing the year at per pound  according to ryan s notes  and are trading at per pound as of early march liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to the receipt of cash contributions from pos minerals upon the satisfaction of the rod contribution conditions of million and ongoing cash contributions received from pos minerals of million offset by development expenditures and debt issuance costs incurred of million  advance royalty payments of million  general and administrative costs of million  and the creation of a reserve account by the llc of million 
deposits on property  plant and equipment relate primarily to scheduled payments for long lead time equipment for the mt 
hope project 
see contractual obligations below 
the majority of funds expended were used to advance the mt 
hope project 
total assets as of december  increased to million compared to million as of december  primarily due to the receipt of capital contributions from pos minerals in december as discussed above under securities purchase agreement with hanlong usa mining investment inc  we have signed a series of agreements with hanlong that form the basis of a significant investment by hanlong in the company that is intended to provide the company with adequate capital to develop the mt

on april   we drew down the first tranche of 
table of contents the bridge loan from hanlong in the amount of million 
on december   hanlong completed the purchase of of our fully diluted shares  or approximately million shares  for million 
based on our commitments as of december   we expect to make additional payments of approximately million under milling process equipment orders through the end of and million in as additional financing becomes available  as referenced in agreements with hanlong usa mining investment inc  and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
accordingly  based on our current cash on hand and our ongoing cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity through the full restart of the project and execution of the financing plan without needing to drawdown available funds from the second tranche of the bridge loan 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to development expenditures and debt issuance costs incurred of million  advance royalty payments of million  and general and administrative costs of million offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants

we have suspended fabrication on flotation cells  lime slaking equipment  hydrocyclones  and other smaller milling process equipment with the ability to re initiate fabrication at any time 
the llc terminated the fabrication of two multi hearth molybdenum roasters and has received finished goods of the partially completed order 
the llc plans to re establish a new purchase order with this manufacturer as financing becomes available and equipment procurement is restarted under then current market terms and conditions 
on february   the llc issued a firm purchase order for haul trucks 
the order provides for delivery of those haul trucks required to perform initial mine development  currently scheduled for late or early a non refundable down payment of million was made at the time of order with an additional million paid in december  months prior to anticipated truck shipment  but the contract is cancellable with no further liability to the llc up until the time of truck shipment

the trust will be tasked with developing and implementing programs that will serve to enhance the sustainability and well being of the agricultural economy in the diamond valley hydrographic basin through reduced water consumption  which may include the trust purchasing and relinquishing water rights in diamond valley to help bring the diamond valley basin into a more sustainable water balance 
the trust s activities will be governed by a five member board including one llc representative 
the trust may be funded by the llc over several years based on the achievement of certain milestones 
the achievement of these milestones is considered to be probable  and as such million is accrued in the company s december   financial statements and is included in mining properties  land  and water rights 
at least of the contributions would be provided upon receipt of all permits  full financing and the company s board of directors decision to proceed with construction 
the remaining payments would be split evenly with one payment due no later than days from the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project and the remaining payment due one year thereafter 
permitting considerations in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
the llc was required to obtain a rod from the blm authorizing implementation of the mt 
hope project poo 
this approval was obtained only after successful completion of the process of environmental evaluation  which incorporates substantial public comment 
the llc was also required to obtain various state and 
table of contents federal permits including water protection  air quality  water rights and reclamation permits 
in addition to requiring permits for the development of the mt 
hope project  we will need to obtain and modify various mining and environmental permits during the life of the mt 
hope project 
obtaining  modifying  and renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and substantial expenditures 
the duration and success of the llc s efforts to obtain  modify or renew permits will be contingent upon many variables  some of which are not within the llc s control 
increased costs or delays could occur  depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
all necessary permits may not be obtained and  if obtained  may not be renewed  or the costs involved in each case may exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that the llc would not proceed with the development or operation of the mt 
hope project 
on february   great basin resource watch and the western shoshone defense project filed a complaint against the blm in the us district court  district of nevada  seeking relief under nepa and other federal laws challenging the blm s issuance of the rod for the mt 
hope project 
the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injuction on february  and there is no hearing date set for the motion 
the company has not been named as a defendant in the suit but will closely monitor the litigation and at the appropriate time will seek to intervene in the suit 
the mt 
hope project underwent an exhaustive environmental analysis and review that lasted more than years 
the process to complete the eis included extensive public and cooperation agency input including the blm  the national park service  the us environmental protection agency  the nevada division of wildlife and the county of eureka 
the company supports the work completed by the blm and believes that the rod complies with all federal statutes and rules  is very robust and defensible 
water rights considerations in addition to working to complete financing  we are working to finalize the transfer of water rights to mining use 
in march we were granted our water applications in a ruling by the nevada state engineer state engineer 
however  that ruling was appealed  and in april  a nevada state district court nsdc set aside the ruling on procedural grounds and remanded the matter for another hearing by the state engineer 
on july   the state engineer issued a second ruling granting the company s water right applications 
that ruling was appealed in august by eureka county and two other parties comprised of three individual water rights holders in diamond valley and one in kobeh valley 
the appeals were heard on april  before the nsdc 
on june   the nsdc denied the appeals and affirmed the state engineer s ruling 
further  the state engineer issued all water permits on december  and certain amended permits on january   and the water became available for use at the mt 
hope project following the state engineer s approval of the company s monitoring  management and mitigation plan m plan on june  on july and   respectively  eureka county and two other parties comprised of one individual water rights holder in diamond valley and one in kobeh valley filed notices of appeal  appealing to the nevada supreme court the nsdc s order denying their appeals of the state engineer s ruling 
we are confident the nevada supreme court will uphold the nsdc s order which denied all appeals of the state engineer s ruling 
on july   the same two individual water rights holders appealing the nsdc s order to the nevada supreme court filed an appeal of the state engineer s approval of the company s m plan to the same nsdc 
eureka county did not appeal the approved m plan 
we anticipate a favorable nsdc decision upholding the m plan 
notwithstanding these further appeals  the company s water permits have been granted and the water remains available to the company  as described above  for use at the mt 
hope project 
environmental considerations our mineral property holdings in shoshone county  idaho include lands contained in mining districts that have been designated as superfund sites pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
this superfund site was established to investigate and remediate primarily the bunker hill properties of smelterville  idaho  a small portion of shoshone county where a large smelter was located 
however  because of the extent of environmental impact caused by the historical mining in the mining district  the superfund site covers the majority of shoshone county including our chicago london and little pine creek properties as well as many small towns located in northern idaho 
we have conducted a property environmental investigation of these properties  which revealed no evidence of material adverse environmental effects at either property 
we are unaware of any pending action or proceeding relating to any regulatory matters that would affect our financial position due to these inactive mining claims in shoshone county 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  upon settlement  actual results may differ from estimated amounts 
provision for taxes income taxes are provided based upon the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for income taxes  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset if management does not believe the company has met the more likely than not standard to allow recognition of such an asset 
mining properties  land and water rights the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related asset grouping  asset impairment is considered to exist 
the related impairment loss is measured by comparing estimated future net cash flows on a discounted basis to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
to date no such impairments have been identified 
property and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of three to twenty seven and one half years using straight line depreciation 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of the award  volatility of the underlying equity and estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results associated with share based awards that are forfeited differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
debt issuance and loan commitment costs the company has capitalized certain costs such as technical due diligence  related legal fees  advances against the arrangement fee in the amount of million incurred in direct pursuit of the term loan based on our belief that it is probable that the company will receive the term loan 
a portion of these costs were incurred on behalf of hanlong and will be offset against the million arrangement fee to be paid by the company to hanlong upon the closing of the term loan 
these costs will be amortized over the life of the term loan using the effective interest method once the term loan has been made available 
in addition  the million value placed on the warrant issued to hanlong in connection with the subordinated debt agreement is considered a loan commitment fee 
these costs will be amortized over the life of the subordinated debt loan using the straight line method from the date the loan agreement was effective 
contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest crnci under gaap  certain noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities meet the definition of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments if the ability to redeem the interest is outside of the control of the consolidating entity 
as described in note description of business  the llc agreement permits pos minerals the option to put its interest in the llc to nevada moly upon a change of control  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by a failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with development and operation of the mt 
hope project as contemplated by the parties for a period of consecutive months 
as such  the crnci has continued to be shown as a separate caption between liabilities and equity mezzanine section 
the carrying value of the crnci includes million that will be returned to pos minerals contingent upon the achievement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project as stipulated in the llc agreement 
the expected return of capital to pos minerals is carried at redemption value as we believe redemption of this amount is probable 
the remaining carrying value of the crnci has not been adjusted to its redemption value as the contingencies that may allow pos minerals to require redemption of its 
table of contents noncontrolling interest are not probable of occurring 
under gaap  until such time as that contingency has been eliminated and redemption is no longer contingent upon anything other than the passage of time  no adjustment to the crnci balance should be made 
future changes in the redemption value will be recognized immediately as they occur and the company will adjust the carrying amount of the crnci to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are a development stage company in the business of the exploration  development and mining of properties primarily containing molybdenum 
as a result  upon commencement of production  our financial performance could be materially affected by fluctuations in the market price of molybdenum and other metals we may mine 
the market prices of metals can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors 
these factors include fluctuations with respect to the rate of inflation  the exchange rates of the us dollar and other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political and economic conditions  banking environment  global and regional demand  production costs  and investor sentiment 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation molybdenum market update for a discussion of molybdenum prices 
in order to better manage commodity price risk and to seek to reduce the negative impact of fluctuations in prices  we will seek to enter into long term supply contracts for our portion of the mt 
hope production 
on december   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with arcelormittal sa arcelormittal  the world s largest steel company  that provides for arcelormittal to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
the supply agreement provides for a floor price along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years after the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
on april   arcelormittal and the company entered into an extension molybdenum supply agreement  providing arcelormittal with a five year option to make effective an agreement to purchase from the company million pounds of molybdenum per year for years following the expiration of the initial supply agreement 
the additional optional off take will be priced in alignment with the company s existing supply agreements 
in order for arcelormittal to exercise this option and make the extension agreement effective  arcelormittal must have beneficial ownership of more than million shares of company common stock on or prior to april  according to public filings  on january   the boards of directors of arcelormittal sa and aperam each approved the transfer of the assets comprising arcelormittal s stainless and specialty steels businesses from its carbon steel and mining businesses to aperam  a separate entity incorporated in the grand duchy of luxembourg 
this transfer included the supply agreement the company had in place with arcelormittal and the shares of the company s common stock previously owned by arcelormittal 
additionally  on may   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with seah besteel corporation seah besteel  korea s largest manufacturer of specialty steels  which provides for seah besteel to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
like the arcelormittal supply agreement  the supply agreement with seah besteel provides for a floor price along with staged discounts for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years from the date of first supply under the agreement 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
on august   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement sojitz agreement with sojitz corporation sojitz 
the sojitz agreement provides for the supply of million pounds per year of molybdenum for five years  beginning once the mt 
hope project reaches certain minimum commercial production levels 
one million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be subject to a per pound molybdenum floor price and is offset by a flat discount to spot molybdenum prices above the floor 
the remaining million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be sold with reference to spot molybdenum prices without regard to a floor price 
the sojitz agreement includes a provision that allows sojitz the option to cancel in the event that supply from the mt 
hope project has not begun by january  the described option is available up to ten days following the achievement of certain production levels at the mt 
hope project 
based on our current development timeline  sojitz will have the option to cancel its contract or participate in the molybdenum supply agreement as described above 
if sojitz elects to cancel its contract with us  the supply of million pounds per year of molybdenum for five years will be assumed by hanlong  pursuant to the terms of the hanlong molybdenum supply agreement described below 
on march   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement hanlong agreement with hanlong 
the hanlong agreement requires hanlong to purchase the company s entire share of the mt 
hope molybdenum production above that necessary for the company to meet its existing supply commitments until the expiration of those commitments 
after the expiration of the existing supply agreements  until the original scheduled maturity date of the term loan  or if the company elects not to enter into the term loan  years after commencement of commercial production  hanlong must annually purchase the greater of million pounds or of the company s share of mt 
hope production 
following the original scheduled maturity date of the term 
table of contents loan  or if the company elects not to enter into the term loan  years after commencement of commercial production from the mt 
hope mine  hanlong must purchase a percentage of the company s share of mt 
hope production equal to times hanlong s fully diluted percentage ownership of our common stock 
subject to certain exceptions  the hanlong agreement will terminate once hanlong s fully diluted ownership percentage falls below 
as long as hanlong continues to guarantee the term loan  the hanlong agreement will not terminate even if hanlong s ownership falls below 
if the cause of hanlong s ownership falling below is a change of control of the company or a dilutive transaction in which hanlong does not have the right to participate  the hanlong agreement will not terminate and hanlong will be obligated to continue to purchase a percentage of the company s share of mt 
hope production equal to times hanlong s fully diluted percentage ownership of the company as it existed immediately prior to such change of control or dilutive transaction 
if the company elects not to enter into the term loan  and tranche under the purchase agreement does not close  hanlong s obligation to purchase the company s share of mt 
hope production in each of the periods described above will be half of the obligations described above 
the supply off take agreement provides for a floor price  along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price  for twenty five percent of the production hanlong receives 
the remaining of the production hanlong receives will be sold with reference to spot molybdenum prices less a small discount 
all four long term supply agreements provide for supply only after commercial production levels are achieved  and no provisions require the company to deliver product or make any payments if commercial production is never achieved or declines  in later periods and have floor prices ranging from to per pound and incremental discounts above the floor price 
the agreements require that monthly shortfalls be made up only if the company s portion of mt 
hope production is available for delivery  after pos minerals has taken its share 
in no event do these requirements to make up monthly shortfalls become obligations of the company if production does not meet targeted levels 
furthermore  each of the agreements have take or pay provisions that require the buyers to either take delivery of product made available by the company  or to pay as though they had taken delivery pursuant to the term of the agreements 
while we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past  we may elect to enter into derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price risk 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not expect to enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of december   we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of million 
interest rates on short term  highly liquid investments have not changed materially since december   and continue to be or less on an annualized basis 
our debt agreements have interest rates of libor plus a percentage 
any significant rise in the libor rate during the course of our debt agreements may affect our ability to service the debt
