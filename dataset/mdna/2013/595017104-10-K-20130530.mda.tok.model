introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document  as well as with other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data 
we begin our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
in the next section  beginning at page  we discuss our results of continuing operations for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
acquisition of smsc on august   we closed our acquisition of smsc and smsc became a wholly owned subsidiary of microchip 
we financed the transaction using approximately million of our existing balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and borrowings of approximately million under our existing credit agreement 
at august   smsc had approximately million of cash and investments on its balance sheet 
smsc is a leading developer of smart mixed signal connectivity solutions 
smsc is focused on delivering connectivity solutions that enable the proliferation of data in automobiles  consumer devices  pcs and other applications 
strategy our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications 
our strategic focus is on the embedded control market  which includes microcontrollers  high performance linear and mixed signal devices  power management and thermal management devices  connectivity devices  interface devices  serial eeproms  superflash memory products  our patented keeloq security devices and flash ip solutions 
we provide highly cost effective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size  high performance  low voltage power operation and ease of development  enabling timely and cost effective embedded control product integration by our customers 
we license superflash technology to foundries  integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products 
we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries 
the principal markets that we serve include consumer  automotive  industrial  office automation and telecommunications 
our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 
our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication  wafer probe and assembly and test 
the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy  enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry 
by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations  and by employing statistical process control techniques  we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields 
direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles 
this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin 
we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing increased due to our acquisition of smsc which outsourced all of its manufacturing 

table of contents we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products 
we believe our processes afford us both cost effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs 
while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines  we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non volatile memory products 
this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly 
our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design  simulation and layout  and our in house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 
we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products  including development systems  and in our design and manufacturing process technologies 
we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position 
our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers  digital signal controllers  memory and mixed signal products  flash ip systems  new development systems  software and application specific software libraries 
we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 
we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 
our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers 
we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base 
our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas  europe and asia 
we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america  europe and asia 
we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market 
many of our field sales engineers fses  field application engineers faes  and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment 
we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products 
the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams 
faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world  and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and end user support 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  business combinations  share based compensation  inventories  income taxes  junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems  however  we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 
revenue recognition distributors our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights  so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer 
revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since  due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
at the time of shipment to these distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 
we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points 
the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance 
the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer 
the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer  product  quantity ordered  geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare 
the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors 
therefore  we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions  rather  price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product 
at march   we had approximately million of deferred revenue and million in deferred cost of sales recognized as million of deferred income on shipments to distributors 
at march   we had approximately million of deferred revenue and million in deferred cost of sales recognized as million of deferred income on shipments to distributors 
the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers 
these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 
distributor advances  reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million at march  and million at march  on sales to distributors  our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost 
the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant 
it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases  requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances  on a current basis  generally within days  for amounts originally invoiced 
this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors 
as such  we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributor working capital requirements 
these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage 
such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income 
we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and true up the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter 
the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured  bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand 
the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 
we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions  competitive considerations and other factors 
price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered 
when we reduce the price of our products  it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction 
there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection  as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 
products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations 
we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account 
because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped  and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost  we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

table of contents business combinations all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  i acquisition related costs  except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities  will be expensed in the period incurred  ii non controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  iii in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility  iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital 
the measurement of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment 
the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments  in particular  requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach 
the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model  which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue  expenses  capital spending and other costs  and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows 
the valuation of non marketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets  recent financing activity by the investees  the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests 
share based compensation we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
total share based compensation in fiscal was million  of which million was reflected in operating expenses 
total share based compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal was million 
total share based compensation included in our inventory balance was million at march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
we estimate the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements 
if forfeiture adjustments are made  they would affect our gross margin  research and development expenses  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal was immaterial 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable 
in estimating our inventory obsolescence  we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 
table of contents month demand 
estimates for projected month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior three month period  which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business 
the estimated month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the month demand estimate 
management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations 
for example  demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand 
alternatively  demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 
in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity  the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales 
as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs  approximately million and million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
there were no such charges in fiscal income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of such assets  will not be realized 
at march   the valuation allowances totaled million and relate to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards  capital losses  foreign tax credits and state tax credits 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at march   our deferred tax asset was million 
various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses 
companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations 
we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years and and smsc is currently under irs audit for fiscal years and we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
we believe that we maintain appropriate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 
junior subordinated convertible debentures we separately account for the liability and equity components of our junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized 
this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt  classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
lastly  we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met 
we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash 
this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share  which was at march   and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 
contingencies in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in a limited number of legal actions  both as plaintiff and defendant  and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them 
we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents  intellectual property rights or other matters 
with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party  although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon  and we are  and from time to time have been  subject to such litigation 
no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

table of contents results of continuing operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges operating income net sales we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of flash intellectual property 
we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers  referred to as oems  in a broad range of markets  perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 
in certain circumstances  a customer financial condition may require collateral  and  in such cases  the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 
our net sales of  million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal  and our net sales of  million in fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to our acquisition of smsc on august   offset in part by adverse general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 
average selling prices for our semiconductor products were up approximately in fiscal over fiscal and were essentially flat in fiscal over fiscal the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately in fiscal over fiscal and down approximately in fiscal over fiscal the increase in the number of units of our semiconductor products sold and our average selling prices in fiscal was a result of our acquisition of smsc 
the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions 
key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include our acquisition of smsc whose net sales included in our consolidated statements of income was approximately million in fiscal  global economic conditions in the markets we serve  semiconductor industry conditions  inventory holding patterns of our customers  increasing semiconductor content in our customers products  customers increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions  our new product offerings that have increased our served available market  and continued market share gains in the segments of the markets we address 

table of contents sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  microcontrollers analog  interface and mixed signal products memory products technology licensing other total sales microcontrollers our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales 
microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal  and decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from our acquisition of smsc and market share gains which offset weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets that we serve including the consumer  automotive  industrial control  communications and computing markets 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from changes in general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets that we serve 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product 
the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines  primarily due to competitive conditions 
we have in the past been able to  and expect in the future to be able to  moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices 
we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which could adversely affect our operating results 
analog  interface and mixed signal products sales of our analog  interface and mixed signal products accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our analog  interface and mixed signal products increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc and market share gains achieved within the analog  interface and mixed signal market 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven primarily by weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions which offset market share gains achieved within the analog  interface and mixed signal market 
analog  interface and mixed signal products can be proprietary or non proprietary in nature 
currently  we consider more than of our analog  interface and mixed signal product mix to be proprietary in nature  where prices are relatively stable  similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products 
the non proprietary portion of our analog  interface and mixed signal business will experience price fluctuations  driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products 
we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog  interface and mixed signal products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog  interface and mixed signal products will increase over time 
memory products sales of our memory products accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal 
table of contents net sales of our memory products decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal  and decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the decreases in memory product net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal were driven primarily by adverse customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets and weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 
memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature  with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability  driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products 
we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which could adversely affect our operating results 
technology licensing technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with technology licensed for the use of our superflash technology and fees for engineering services 
technology licensing accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales related to our technology licensing decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in technology licensing net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to adverse semiconductor industry and global economic conditions 
the increase in technology licensing net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven primarily by the adoption of our technology by more manufacturers of semiconductors 
other revenue from assembly and test subcontracting services accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal distribution distributors accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in fiscal the decrease in distributor net sales in fiscal compared to prior periods was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc which makes a larger percentage of its net sales to oem customers rather than through distributors 
our largest distributor  future electronics  accounted for approximately of our net sales in each of fiscal and fiscal our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in each of fiscal and fiscal no other distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal generally  we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and we  or our distributors  may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice 
the loss of  or the disruption in the operations of  one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 
at march   our distributors maintained days of inventory of our products compared to days at march  and days at march  over the past three fiscal years  the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately days and days 
we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales  due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors 

table of contents net sales by geography net sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  americas europe asia total net sales our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe  which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive  communications  computing  consumer and industrial control products 
americas sales include sales to customers in the us  canada  central america and south america 
sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in fiscal substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 
sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market as well as acquisitions such as smsc which had a significant concentration of sales in asia 
our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 
sales to customers in china  including hong kong  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately in fiscal sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in fiscal we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 
gross profit our gross profit was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were charges of approximately million in fiscal related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisitions which reduced our gross margins  production levels being below the range of our normal capacity  resulting in under absorption of fixed costs  in fiscal and the second half of fiscal compared to production levels being at or above the range of our normal capacity levels in the first half of fiscal and all of fiscal  for each of fiscal and fiscal  inventory write downs being higher than the gross margin impact of sales of inventory that was previously written down  and fluctuations in the product mix of microcontrollers  analog products  memory products and technology licensing 
other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include continual cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing  such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques  and lower depreciation as a percentage of cost of sales 
we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industry related conditions 
when production levels are below normal capacity  we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity 
our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels  which we typically consider to be to of the actual capacity of the installed equipment  during fiscal and the second half of fiscal in response to weak economic conditions 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we operated at or above normal capacity levels in our wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs  approximately million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal and approximately million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal in the 
table of contents future  if production levels are below normal capacity  we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity 
similar to our wafer fabs  during fiscal and the second half of fiscal  we operated at levels below the total operating capacity of our thailand assembly and test facility due to adverse business conditions and these actions had a negative impact on our gross margins 
during the first half of fiscal and all of fiscal  we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand assembly and test facility  and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facility during such time 
the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins 
fab currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies  but predominantly utilizes our to micron processes 
fab predominantly utilizes our to micron processes 
we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs 
all of our production has been on inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 
our overall inventory levels were million at march   compared to million at march  and million at march  we maintained days of inventory on our balance sheet at march  compared to days of inventory at march  and days at march  we expect our inventory levels in the june quarter to increase modestly from the march levels due to projected higher wafer purchases from third party foundries 
we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers and allow us to keep our fiscal capital expenditures at relatively low levels 
we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by capacity utilization levels  the overall product mix of microcontroller  analog  interface and mixed signal products  memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter  as well as manufacturing yields  fixed cost absorption  and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  approximately of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities  compared to approximately during the fourth quarter of fiscal and approximately during the fourth quarter of fiscal the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry and our internal capacity capabilities 
third party contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  approximately of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately during the fourth quarter of fiscal and approximately during the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs  as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 
smsc had historically outsourced the majority of its assembly and test activities 
we plan to bring some of smsc assembly and test activities into our thailand facilities over time 
we have  in recent years  outsourced a larger portion of our wafer production requirements to third party wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities 
as a result of our acquisitions of smsc in august and silicon storage technology sst in april  we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements 
in fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  approximately and of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 
our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract 
while we review the quality  delivery and cost performance of our third party contractors  our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields  assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
research and development r d r d expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal and million  or of sales  for fiscal we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products  including development systems software  and in our design and manufacturing process technologies 
we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position 
r d costs are expensed as incurred 
assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
r d expenses include labor  depreciation  masks  prototype wafers  and expenses for the development of process technologies  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
r d expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reasons for the dollar increase in r d costs in fiscal compared to fiscal were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc and higher 
table of contents headcount costs 
r d expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reasons for the dollar increase in r d costs in fiscal compared to fiscal were an increased number of employees driving higher employee costs and higher discretionary expenses offset by lower bonus costs 
in the june quarter  we expect r d expenses to be relatively flat with the march quarter and for such expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales due to operational efficiencies and continued synergies of integrating our acquisition of smsc 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal  and million  or of sales  for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal over fiscal were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal over fiscal were lower bonus costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time  primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 
special charges acquisition related expenses during fiscal  we incurred special charges of million comprised of a million net increase in the fair value of contingent consideration related to one of our acquisitions  million of primarily severance related costs in addition to office closing  and other costs associated with the acquisition of smsc and legal settlement costs of approximately million for certain legal matters related to sst which we acquired in april in excess of previously accrued amounts 
during fiscal  special charges included a benefit of million comprised of a million favorable adjustment to contingent consideration offset by million of severance related charges related to a prior year acquisition 
during fiscal  we incurred million of severance related and office closure costs associated with our acquisition of sst 
patent licenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we agreed to the terms of a patent license with an unrelated third party and signed an agreement on march  the patent license settled alleged infringement claims 
the total payment made to the third party in march was million  million of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the remaining million was recorded as a prepaid royalty which will be amortized over the remaining life of the patents  which expire in december other income expense interest income in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease in interest income for fiscal over fiscal relates to lower yields on short term cash investments and lower invested cash balances 
the primary reasons for the increase in interest income in fiscal over fiscal relates to the redemption of a previously written down auction rate security at par value and higher invested cash balances 
interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal over fiscal relates to increased borrowings under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition of smsc 
other expense  net in fiscal was million compared to other expense  net of million in fiscal and other income  net of million in fiscal the change in other expense income  net during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily relates to million of losses on equity securities during fiscal compared to million of gains on equity securities during fiscal these losses and 
table of contents gains were a result of impairment charges due to market fluctuations in the value of certain investments in publicly traded companies  as well as dividends received and losses and gains recognized on the sale of these equity securities 
provision for income taxes provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings 
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal excluding one time tax events described below  our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates  changes in tax regulations and the r d tax credit 
during fiscal  our effective tax rate was higher due to million of one time foreign and domestic tax implications from our acquisition of smsc  which offset an million benefit received from the reinstatement of the r d credit and million of other non recurring tax events including releases of previously established tax reserves related to audit closures and expirations of statutes of limitations and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these items increased our effective tax rate from continuing operations by to an effective tax rate of 
during fiscal  we completed a project that led to additional r d tax credit claims in the amount of million which reduced our effective tax rate by to 
our effective tax rate in fiscal includes a million benefit related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal through fiscal tax audits  the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves  and a charge related to a corporate restructuring 
this benefit reduced our effective tax rate from continuing operations by percentage points to an effective tax rate of 
various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses 
companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations 
we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years and  and smsc is under audit for fiscal years and we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment  a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 
our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property  plant and equipment in thailand 
our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future and any expiration of our tax holidays in thailand are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 
results of discontinued operations as a result of our acquisition of sst  certain of sst product lines were marketed for sale based on management decision regarding them not being a strategic fit into our product portfolio 
the discontinued businesses include various memory product lines 
for financial statement purposes  the net assets and results of operations for these discontinued businesses have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
on may   we completed a transaction to sell one of the businesses acquired from sst to greenliant systems  ltd 
the sale price in this transaction was determined by management to represent fair value  and accordingly  no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the net assets 
in this sale  we disposed of approximately million of assets held for sale  primarily comprised of inventory  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and non marketable securities 
consideration in the transaction was in the form of cash and notes receivable from greenliant systems  ltd 
on july   we granted an exclusive limited license for certain serial nor flash products to professional computer technology  ltd 
pct 
the license is limited to certain industry segments and geographic regions and excludes certain multinational customers 
pct has no license to sell these products to any other industry segment or geographic region other than as set forth in our agreement with them 
the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
contributing to the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was million of inventory write downs related to discontinued operations 
there were no assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal years ended march  or march  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we had  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at march   an increase of million from the march  balance 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities being offset by dividend payments of million and cash used for our acquisitions  net of proceeds received from our line of credit  of million 
net cash provided from operating activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities and lower net income in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to million of cash consideration  net of million of cash and cash equivalents acquired  used for our acquisition of smsc 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in cash related to changes in our net purchases  sales and maturities of short term and long term investments which offset lower capital expenditures in fiscal our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the lower capital expenditure activity in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by decreased production requirements as a result of uncertain economic conditions 
capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment 
we currently intend to spend approximately million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain  and selectively increase  capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 
we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal we received cash proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement of million during fiscal which was used to partially finance our acquisition of smsc 
we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal on august   we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  with a million foreign currency sublimit  a million letter of credit sublimit and a million swingline loan sublimit  terminating on august  the credit agreement also contains an increase option permitting us  subject to certain requirements  to arrange with existing lenders and or new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of million in additional commitments  which may be for revolving loans or term loans 
proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
at march   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit agreement 
on august   we closed our acquisition of smsc  and smsc became a wholly owned subsidiary of microchip 
upon the closing of the acquisition  each share of common stock of smsc was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive in cash  without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes 
we financed the transaction using approximately million of our existing balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and borrowings of approximately million under our existing credit agreement 
at august   smsc had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and long term investments on its balance sheet 
our total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was  million at march  and  million at march  under current tax laws and regulations  if accumulated earnings and profits held by our foreign subsidiaries that us taxes had not previously been provided for were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes and 
table of contents foreign withholding taxes 
the balance of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments available for our us operations as of march  and march  was approximately million and million  respectively 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed 
we believe our offshore earnings are permanently reinvested offshore 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not determine to repatriate some of our offshore earnings in future periods to fund stockholder dividends  share repurchases  acquisitions or other corporate activities in the future 
we expect that a significant portion of our future cash generation will be in our foreign subsidiaries 
we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years  there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future 
at march   we had million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
on december   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of march   we had repurchased million shares under this million share authorization for a total of million 
there is no expiration date associated with this program 
the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions  interest rates  and corporate considerations 
as of march   we held approximately million shares as treasury shares 
on october   we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock 
the initial quarterly dividend of per share was paid on december  in the amount of million 
to date  our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately billion 
during fiscal  we paid dividends in the amount of per share for a total dividend payment of million 
during fiscal  we paid dividends in the amount of per share for a total dividend payment of million 
during fiscal  we paid dividends in the amount of per share for a total dividend payment of million 
on may   we declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  which will be paid on june   to stockholders of record on may  and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately million 
our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid  or not to pay a dividend  on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements and future prospects  and other factors deemed relevant by our board 
our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development 
we may further borrow under our credit agreement  expand our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to increase our level of domestic cash to fund dividends  share repurchases or acquisitions  or to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities  or for other purposes 
the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our level of dividend payments  changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash  demand for our products  changes in industry conditions  product mix  competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march  dollars in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital purchase obligations other purchase obligations and commitments borrowings under credit agreement outstanding as of march  principal and interest junior convertible debentures principal and interest total contractual obligations capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property  plant and equipment 
these obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of march   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries of approximately million for delivery of wafers in fiscal for purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our credit agreement borrowings outstanding at march  will be paid on august   which is the maturity date of such borrowings 
for purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our convertible debentures will be paid on december  total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
the contractual obligations also do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services  with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries  are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance to clarify the reclassification requirements from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income 
this amendment requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount is reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period 
for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to 
table of contents the related note on the face of the financial statements for additional information 
these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal year these changes are required to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments are intended to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations  and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  money market funds  cash deposits  and marketable securities that we hold on an available for sale basis  was  million as of march  compared to  million as of march  the available for sale debt securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase 
the following table provides information about our available for sale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have aggregated our available for sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands financial instruments maturing during the fiscal year ended march  thereafter available for sale securities weighted average yield rate at march   million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars 
with the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions and are not liquid 
while we continue to earn interest on these investments based on a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices  the estimated market value for a portion of these ars no longer approximates the original purchase value 
the fair value of the failed ars of million has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions 
we evaluated the impairments in the value of these ars  determining our intent to sell these securities prior to the recovery of our amortized cost basis  which resulted in some of the securities being other than temporarily impaired and recognized impairment charges on these investments of million in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a million gain on our ars positions as a gain on redemption at par value of one ars position offset impairment charges recognized during the year 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings
