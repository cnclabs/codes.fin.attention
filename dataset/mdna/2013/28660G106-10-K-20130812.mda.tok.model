item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a global prestige beauty products company with an extensive portfolio of prestige fragrance  skin care and cosmetics brands 
our extensive product portfolio includes the following elizabeth arden brand the elizabeth arden skin care brands visible difference  ceramide  prevage  and eight hour cream  elizabeth arden branded lipstick  foundation and other color cosmetics products  and the elizabeth arden fragrances red door  elizabeth arden th avenue  elizabeth arden green tea and untold celebrity fragrances the fragrance brands of britney spears  elizabeth taylor  mariah carey  taylor swift  justin bieber  nicki minaj and usher lifestyle fragrances curve  giorgio beverly hills  ps fine cologne and white shoulders designer fragrances juicy couture  alfred sung  bcbgmaxazria  ed hardy  geoffrey beene  halston  john varvatos  lucky  rocawear and true religion in addition to our owned and licensed fragrance brands  we distribute approximately additional prestige fragrance brands  primarily in the united states  through distribution agreements and other purchasing arrangements 
in august  we amended our long term license agreement with liz claiborne  inc and certain of its affiliates and acquired all of the us and international trademarks for the curve fragrance brands as well as trademarks for certain other smaller fragrance brands 
the amendment established a lower effective royalty rate for the remaining licensed fragrance brands  including juicy couture and lucky brand fragrances  reduced the future minimum guaranteed royalties for the term of the license  and required a pre payment of royalties for the remainder of calendar we paid liz claiborne  inc and its affiliates million in cash in connection with this transaction 
we capitalized million of the million cash paid as exclusive brand trademarks and the balance was recorded as a prepaid asset associated with the settlement of royalties for the remainder of calendar year and the buy down of future royalties for and beyond 
in may  we acquired the global licenses and certain related assets  including inventory  for the ed hardy  true religion and bcbgmaxazria fragrance brands from new wave fragrances  llc 
prior to the acquisition  we had been acting as a distributor of the ed hardy and true religion fragrances to certain mid tier and mass retailers in the north america 
the total cost of the acquisition was million  including amounts paid for inventory of million  of which million was paid in cash and million was retained by us and was scheduled to be paid in the third quarter of fiscal  subject to the settlement of certain post closing adjustments 
the full million of the purchase price that we retained was offset by post closing adjustments and was not paid to new wave fragrances  llc 
this transaction was accounted for as a business combination 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acquisition and allocation of the purchase price 
in june  we also acquired the global licenses and certain assets related to the justin bieber and nicki minaj fragrance brands  including inventory of the justin bieber fragrances  from give back brands llc 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid give back brands llc million  including million for inventory 
in addition  we have issued to give back brands llc a subordinated note in the principal amount of million  payable upon the achievement of specified net sales targets for the acquired brands over the three year period from july  through june  based on results for the six months ended december   conditions for payment of the first million installment were satisfied  and such installment was paid during the third quarter of fiscal in addition  based on the results for fiscal  conditions for payment of the second million installment have been satisfied and such installment is payable during the first quarter of fiscal this transaction was accounted for as a business combination 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acquisition and allocation of the purchase price 
for ease of reference in this form k  the acquisitions from new wave fragrances llc and give back brands llc are referred to herein on a collective basis as the acquisitions 
logo 
table of contents in fiscal  we invested a total of million  including transaction costs  for a minority investment in elizabeth arden salon holdings  llc  an unrelated entity whose subsidiaries operate the elizabeth arden red door spas and the mario tricoci hair salons 
the investment was made with the intent of accelerating the growth of the spa business in parallel with the growth of the elizabeth arden brand and the elizabeth arden brand repositioning 
the investment  which is in the form of a collateralized convertible note bearing interest at  has been accounted for using the cost method and at june   is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to invest an additional million in fiscal our business strategy is currently focused on two important initiatives the global repositioning of the elizabeth arden brand and expanding the market penetration of our prestige fragrance portfolio in international markets  especially in the large european fragrance market  as well as growing markets such as brazil and russia 
we also intend to continue to increase net sales  operating margins and earnings by continuing to expand the prestige fragrance category at mass retail customers in north america and continuing to improve working capital efficiency and return on invested capital 
we believe that our focus on organic growth opportunities for our existing brands  new licensing opportunities and acquisitions  and new product innovation will assist us in achieving these goals 
we are in the process of a comprehensive brand repositioning for the elizabeth arden brand  which is designed to honor the heritage of the brand while modernizing the brand s presentation and increasing its relevance among target consumers 
the brand repositioning includes a revised product assortment  improved product formulations  package redesign  counter redesign  new advertising and marketing vehicles  and enhanced beauty advisor support 
the initial roll out was limited to a number of flagship retail doors 
during fiscal  we introduced our new product assortment to our prestige retail customers and replaced most of such flagship retail counters with new counters 
we also extended elements of the new advertising  marketing and beauty advisor programs beyond our global flagship retail doors to the next tier of approximately retail doors globally 
to date  we have incurred pre tax costs and expenses of million in connection with the brand repositioning 
in fiscal  we expect to incur million to million in additional costs and expenses in connection with the continued roll out of the elizabeth arden brand repositioning and to exit unprofitable retail doors in certain markets 
the specific facts and circumstances of the continued roll out of the repositioning will impact the timing and amount of any such costs and expenses as well as capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we recorded pre tax costs and expenses of million in connection with the brand repositioning  including million for non recurring product changeover costs and expenses and million for product discontinuation charges 
the non recurring product changeover costs and expenses related to the shipping of new product assortment to retailers to replace the older products 
the product discontinuation charges resulted from our strategic decision  based on our current evaluation of market demand and the status of the elizabeth arden brand repositioning  not to incur the additional costs associated with using existing raw materials and other components related to our older elizabeth arden skin care and color cosmetic products to manufacture additional finished goods inventory of such products 
this strategic decision was made in order to accelerate the execution of the elizabeth arden brand repositioning  which should enable systematic improvement in our gross margins in future periods 
in fiscal  we expect to incur approximately million in restructuring related costs 
these one time restructuring costs include amounts for sales positions as well as other staff positions across various business units that are being eliminated to drive expense savings and additional operating efficiencies 
we are also implementing the last phase of an oracle global enterprise system  which includes an upgrade to certain of our information systems relating to our global supply chain and logistics functions 
this is intended to further increase business efficiencies throughout our company to improve our cash flow  operating margins and profitability 
during fiscal  we introduced several new elizabeth arden products including the new visible difference entry level skin care regimen  prevage anti aging intensive repair daily serum  prevage clinical lash brow enhancing serum  several new ceramide skin care products  and a new red door fragrance  red door aura 
we also launched new products for several of our fragrance brands  including pink friday nicki minaj  wonderstruck enchanted  our second fragrance for taylor swift  justin beiber s girlfriend and ed hardy s skull roses 
in fiscal  we plan to launch several new products across the elizabeth arden skin care  color and fragrance categories including prevage anti aging intensive eye serum and prevage anti aging treatment booster cleanser  a ceramide boosting minute facial and a new ceramide line  flawless future  beautiful color lipstick  flawless finish liquid mineral foundation and a new fragrance  untold 
we also plan to launch several fragrances including justin bieber the key  taylor by taylor swift  our second fragrance for nicki minaj  bcbgmaxazria bon genre and a new britney spears fantasy fragrance

table of contents in fiscal  our gross margins were basis points below our fiscal gross margins  including the negative impact of basis points for costs associated with the elizabeth arden brand repositioning and the acquisitions of the licenses for justin bieber  nicki minaj  ed hardy  bcbgmaxazria and true religion fragrance brands 
this basis point gross margin impact in the year ended june  represented an increase of basis points over the basis point impact of these costs in the year ended june  as we complete the integration of the acquisitions and implement the key drivers of our success from the repositioning for the elizabeth arden brand across a larger segment of the business  we expect to begin to see systematic improvement in our gross margin during the second half of fiscal we continue to focus on i expanding gross margins through increased focus on product mix  improved pricing and reduced sales dilution  ii improving our sales and operations planning processes and our supply chain and logistics efficiency and  iii leveraging our overhead structure by increasing sales of our international segment 
we manage our business by evaluating net sales  gross margins  ebitda as defined in note under item selected financial data  ebitda margin  segment profit and working capital utilization including monitoring our levels of inventory  accounts receivable  operating cash flow and return on invested capital 
we encounter a variety of challenges that may affect our business and should be considered as described in item a risk factors and in the section management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are most likely to occur 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates  which are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
if these changes result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements  their impact is disclosed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures below also note situations in which it is reasonably likely that future financial results could be affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
the term reasonably likely refers to an occurrence that is more than remote but less than probable in the judgment of management 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail below 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
under the accounting for business combinations  consideration paid in an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the consideration paid at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired or liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ  and the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one area that requires more judgment is determining the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets 
because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we discontinue or experience a decline in the profitability of one or more of our brands  the value of the intangible assets associated with those brands or their useful lives may decline  or  certain intangible assets such as the elizabeth arden brand trademarks  may no longer be classified as an indefinite lived asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
logo 
table of contents during the quarter ended june   we adopted the updated guidance to topic  intangibles goodwill and other  issued by financial accounting standards board fasb in september  which simplifies how an entity assesses goodwill for impairment and allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment 
an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
should a goodwill impairment assessment be necessary  there is a two step process for assessing impairment of goodwill 
the first step used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets to their respective carrying values 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to estimated fair value 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued another update to codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update simplifies the guidance for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
examples of intangible assets subject to the guidance include indefinite lived trademarks  licenses  and distribution rights 
the amendments allow a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
a company electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the company determines  based on such qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the changes to codification topic will be effective for us beginning july   with early adoption permitted 
we did not adopt the updated guidance in topic for our annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill performed during the quarter ended june  adoption of the updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks  patents and other intellectual property  customer relationships and lists  non compete agreements and goodwill 
the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives such as our elizabeth arden trademarks  are not amortized  but rather assessed for impairment at least annually 
we typically perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not fully be recoverable 
during the quarter ended june   we completed our annual impairment assessment of the elizabeth arden trademarks  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
in assessing the fair value of these trademarks  we considered the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the analysis and assessments of these assets and goodwill indicated that no impairment adjustment was required as the estimated fair value exceeded the recorded carrying value 
a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of our elizabeth arden trademarks or a hypothetical increase in the discount rate used to estimate fair value would not result in an impairment of our elizabeth arden trademarks 
during the quarter ended june   we also completed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill using the qualitative assessment under the updated guidance to topic the analysis indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our north america reporting unit would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
due to the ongoing uncertainty in capital market conditions  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the expected future cash flows of our reporting units and the long term trends of our market capitalization for the purposes of assessing the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived elizabeth arden trademarks  other trademarks and intangible assets 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate  this could increase the likelihood of future material non cash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill  indefinite lived elizabeth arden trademarks  or other trademarks and intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
periodically  we review the lives assigned to our long lived assets and adjust the lives  as circumstances dictate 
because estimated useful life is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we experience significant declines in net sales in certain channels of distribution  it could affect the estimated useful life of certain of our long lived assets  such as counters or trade fixtures  which could result in additional charges to net income 
logo 
table of contents long lived assets 
we review for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
because the fair value is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
the same circumstances that could affect the estimated useful life of a long lived asset  as discussed above  could cause us to change our estimate of the fair value of that asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
we did not record any adjustments to our long lived assets in fiscal  or long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns  markdowns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns and markdowns represents management s estimate of future returns and markdowns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers primarily north american department stores and specialty beauty stores  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product for credit against amounts previously billed or to receive a markdown allowance 
upon sale to such customers  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our level of sales  historical and projected experience with product returns and markdowns in each of our business segments and with respect to each of our product types  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and customer mix 
we make detailed estimates at the segment  product and customer level  which are then aggregated to arrive at a consolidated provision for product returns and markdowns and are reviewed periodically as facts and circumstances warrant 
such provisions and markdown allowances are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
because there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the allowance for returns and markdowns  it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates 
if  for example  customer demand for our products is lower than estimated or a proportionately greater amount of sales is made to department stores and or specialty beauty stores  additional provisions for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
similarly  if customer demand for our products is higher than estimated  a reduction of our provision for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in an increase to income in the period in which the determination was made 
as a percentage of gross sales  our returns and markdowns were  and for the fiscal years ending june   and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for sales returns and markdowns as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates  which may result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required  resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
because of the subjective nature of this estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  demand for our products declines  or if we decide to discontinue certain products  we may need to increase our provision for inventory obsolescence which would result in additional charges to net income 
a hypothetical change in the value of our provision for inventory obsolescence as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
hedge contracts 
we have designated each qualifying foreign currency contract we have entered into as a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings or the transactions are no longer probable of occurring 
changes to fair value of any contracts deemed to be ineffective would be recognized in earnings immediately 
logo 
table of contents share based compensation 
all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values  but only to the extent that vesting is considered probable 
compensation cost for awards that vest will not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation costs for awards are amortized using the straight line method 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rate impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions are based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we rely on our historical experience and post vested termination activity to provide data for estimating our expected term for use in determining the fair value of our stock options 
we currently estimate our stock volatility by considering our historical stock volatility experience and other key factors 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using our historical experience 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimates 
because of the significant amount of judgment used in these calculations  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate  additional charges to net income may be required 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would likely be charged or credited to net income in the period in which such determination was made 
we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not that such position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits 
while we believe that our assessments of whether our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained are reasonable  each assessment is subjective and requires the use of significant judgments 
as a result  one or more of such assessments may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could result in a change to net income 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency contracts we operate in several foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our risk management policy is to enter into cash flow hedges to reduce a portion of the exposure of our foreign subsidiaries revenues to fluctuations in currency rates using foreign currency forward contracts 
we also enter into cash flow hedges for a portion of our forecasted inventory purchases to reduce the exposure of our canadian and australian subsidiaries cost of sales to such fluctuations  as well as cash flow hedges for a portion of our subsidiaries forecasted swiss franc operating costs 
the principal currencies hedged are british pounds  euros  canadian dollars  australian dollars and swiss francs 
we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
changes to fair value of the foreign currency contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity  to the extent such contracts are effective  and are recognized in net sales or cost of sales in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings or the transactions are no longer probable of occurring 
changes to fair value of any contracts deemed to be ineffective would be recognized in earnings immediately 
there were no amounts recorded in the fiscal years ended june   or relating to foreign currency contracts used to hedge forecasted revenues  forecasted cost of sales or operating costs resulting from hedge ineffectiveness 
when appropriate  we also enter into and settle foreign currency contracts for euros  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars to reduce exposure of our foreign subsidiaries balance sheets to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
these contracts are used to hedge balance sheet exposure generally over one month and are settled before the end of the month in which they are entered into 
changes to fair value of the forward contracts are recognized in selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which the contracts expire

see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may  at any time  increase the size of the credit facility up to million without entering into a formal amendment requiring the consent of all of the banks  subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit facility was amended in june to allow for the contingent consideration that may become payable with respect to the acquisition of certain assets of give back brands llc and to allow for the second lien facility further discussed below 
the credit facility expires in january the credit facility is guaranteed by all of our us subsidiaries and is collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under the new credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of the appraised net liquidation value of our inventory  as determined pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  provided  however  that from august to october of each year  our borrowing base may be temporarily increased by up to million 
the credit facility has only one financial maintenance covenant  which is a debt service coverage ratio that must be maintained at not less than to if average borrowing base capacity declines to less than million million from september through january 
our average borrowing base capacity for each of the quarters during fiscal did not fall below the applicable thresholds noted above 
accordingly  the debt service coverage ratio did not apply during the year ended june  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facility for the quarter and year ended june  under the terms of the credit facility  we may pay dividends or repurchase common stock if we maintain borrowing base capacity of at least million from february to august  and at least million from september to january  after making the applicable payment 
the credit facility restricts us from incurring additional non trade indebtedness other than refinancings and certain small amounts of indebtedness 
borrowings under the credit portion of the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on an applicable margin which is determined by reference to a debt service coverage ratio 
at our option  the applicable margin may be applied to either the london interbank offered rate libor or the base rate which is comparable to prime rates 
the applicable margin ranges from to for libor loans and from to for base rate loans  except that the applicable margin on the first million of borrowings from august to october of each year  while the temporary increase in our borrowing base is in effect  is higher 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from to based on the quarterly average unused portion of the credit facility 
the interest rates payable by us on our senior notes and on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and second lien facility are not impacted by credit rating agency actions 
at june   the applicable margin was for libor loans and for prime rate loans

the second lien facility is collateralized by a second priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventories and the interest on borrowings charged under the second lien facility was either i libor plus an applicable margin of or ii the base rate specified in the second lien facility which is comparable to prime rates plus a margin of

table of contents at june   we had million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
at june   based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory available as collateral  an additional million in the aggregate could be borrowed under our credit facility and our second lien facility 
the borrowing base capacity under the credit facility typically declines in the second half of our fiscal year as our higher accounts receivable balances resulting from holiday season sales are likely to decline due to cash collections 
based upon our internal projections  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facility and the second lien facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or licensing or distribution arrangements 
a deterioration in the economic and retail environment  however  could cause us to fail to satisfy the financial maintenance covenant under our credit facility that applies only in the event we do not have the requisite average borrowing base capacity as set forth under the credit facility 
in such an event  we would not be allowed to borrow under the credit facility and may not have access to the capital necessary for our business 
in addition  a default under our credit facility or the second lien facility that causes acceleration of the debt under either facility could trigger a default under our outstanding senior notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under either borrowing facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers and owners of prestige fragrance brands regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive licensing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no material agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with such manufacturers and brand owners 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations

on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock under the terms of an existing million common stock repurchase program and extended the term of the stock repurchase program from november  to november  on august   our board of directors approved an extension of the stock repurchase program through november  for the fiscal year ended june   we purchased  shares of common stock on the open market under the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share and at a cost of million  including sales commissions
