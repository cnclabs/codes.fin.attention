table of contents supervision and regulation the company and our subsidiaries are subject to an extensive system of laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of customers and depositors and not for the protection of our security holders 
these laws and regulations govern such areas as capital  permissible activities  allowance for loan losses  loans and investments  and rates of interest that can be charged on loans 
described below are elements of selected laws and regulations 
the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described 
holding company regulation 
as a bank holding company and financial holding company  we are subject to comprehensive regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  frequently referred to as the federal reserve board frb  under the bank holding company act  as amended by  among other laws  the gramm leach bliley act of the gramm leach bliley act  and by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  enacted in we must file reports with the frb and such additional information as the frb may require  and our holding company and non banking affiliates are subject to examination by the frb 
under frb policy  a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks 
under this policy  the frb may require  and has required in the past  a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
the bank holding company act provides that a bank holding company must obtain frb approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if  after such acquisition  it would own or control more than of such shares unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the bank holding company act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities which  by statute or by frb regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks 
the list of activities permitted by the frb includes  among other things lending  operating a savings institution  mortgage company  finance company  credit card company or factoring company  performing certain data processing operations  providing certain investment and financial advice  underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit related insurance  leasing property on a full payout  non operating basis  selling money orders  travelers checks and united states savings bonds  real estate and personal property appraising  providing tax planning and preparation services  and  subject to certain limitations  providing securities brokerage services for customers 
these activities may also be affected by federal legislation 
the gramm leach bliley act amended portions of the bank holding company act to authorize bank holding companies  such as us  directly or through non bank subsidiaries to engage in securities  insurance and other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity 
in order to undertake these activities  a bank holding company must become a financial holding company by submitting to the appropriate federal reserve bank a declaration that the company elects to be a financial holding company and a certification that all of the depository institutions controlled by the company are well capitalized and well managed 
broker dealer and related regulatory supervision 
fsis is a member of  and is subject to the regulatory supervision of  the financial industry regulatory authority 
areas subject to this regulatory review include compliance with trading rules  financial reporting  investment suitability for clients  and compliance with stock exchange rules and regulations 
fsis is also subject to the supervision of the investor protection bureau of the new york attorney general s office for its investment advisory business 
depository institution regulation 
our bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
this regulatory structure includes real estate lending standards  which provide guidelines concerning loan to value ratios for various types of real estate loans  risk based capital rules  including accounting for interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks posed by non traditional activities  rules requiring depository institutions to develop and implement internal procedures to evaluate and control credit and settlement exposure to their correspondent banks  rules restricting types and amounts of equity investments  and rules addressing various safety and soundness issues  including operations and managerial standards  standards for asset quality  earnings and compensation standards 

table of contents the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act as amended implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  has or will centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the bureau of consumer financial protection  with broad rulemaking  supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and certain others  including the examination and enforcement powers with respect to any bank with more than billion in assets 
require new capital rules and apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies 
changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated average assets less tangible capital 
as a result  this change generally imposes more deposit insurance cost on institutions with assets of billion or more 
increase the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the deposit insurance fund from to and require the fdic  in setting assessments  to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than billion 
provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance  including guidelines or regulations on incentive based compensation and a prohibition on compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or that could provide excessive compensation 
repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
allow de novo interstate branching by banks 
increased the authority of the frb to examine us and our non bank subsidiary 
required all bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us and the financial services industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation may require us to maintain higher capital levels and or increase our cost of operations and limit certain activities or lines of business 
capital adequacy requirements 
the frb and fdic have issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks 
in addition  these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels  based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth 
the frb s risk based guidelines establish a two tier capital framework 
tier capital generally consists of common shareholders equity  retained earnings  a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock  qualifying trust preferred securities and non controlling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain intangibles 
tier capital generally consists of certain hybrid capital instruments and perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt  qualifying preferred stock  loan loss allowance  and unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities 
the sum of tier and tier capital represents qualifying total capital  at least of which must consist of tier capital 
risk based capital ratios are calculated by dividing tier and total capital by risk weighted assets 
assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk weights  based primarily on relative credit risk 
for bank holding companies  generally the minimum tier risk based capital ratio is and the minimum total risk based capital ratio is 
our tier and total risk based capital ratios under these guidelines at december  were and  respectively 
the frb s leverage capital guidelines establish a minimum leverage ratio determined by dividing tier capital by adjusted average total assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
at december   we had a leverage ratio of

table of contents in june  the us federal banking agencies issued three notices of proposed rulemaking that would revise and replace the current regulatory capital rules 
the proposals were initially intended to be effective on january   but the agencies have deferred implementation due to the volume of comments related to the proposed rules 
in the basel iii notice of proposed rulemaking  the agencies proposal included the implementation of a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier capital requirement 
common equity is the highest quality equity and most loss absorbing form of capital and establishes the base of tier common equity as adjusted for minority interests and various deductions 
the minimum tier common equity ratio under basel iii is 
depending on the final form of the basel iii capital standards  the outcome will likely result in a higher capital requirement  greater volatility in regulatory capital and the elimination of trust preferred instruments in regulatory capital 
it is expected that final rules will be issued in future rulemaking and regulatory changes on capital requirements may impact the company as it continues to grow and evaluate m a activity 
prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within these categories 
this act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank s compliance with the plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet these standards 
the various federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  using the total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures 
these regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a total risk based capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive or order 
an institution is adequately capitalized if it has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a total risk based capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least in certain circumstances 
an institution is undercapitalized if it has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  a total risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than in certain circumstances 
an institution is significantly undercapitalized if it has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  a total risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
an institution is critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than of total assets 
generally  an institution may be reclassified in a lower capitalization category if it is determined that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice 
as of december   our subsidiary bank met the requirements to be classified as well capitalized 
dividends 
the frb policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition  and that it is inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
furthermore  a bank that is classified under the prompt corrective action regulations as undercapitalized will be prohibited from paying any dividends 
our primary source for cash dividends is the dividends we receive from our subsidiary bank 
our bank is subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends  including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums 
approval of the new york state department of financial services is required prior to paying a dividend if the dividend declared by the bank exceeds the sum of the bank s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years 
federal deposit insurance assessments 
the bank is a member of the fdic and pays an insurance premium to the fdic based upon its assessable deposits on a quarterly basis 
deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
under the dodd frank act  a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to  the coverage limit is per depositor  per insured depository institution for each account ownership category 

table of contents the dodd frank act also set a new minimum deposit insurance fund dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic is required to attain this ratio by september  the dodd frank act also required the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity 
premiums for the bank are now calculated based upon the average balance of total assets minus average tangible equity as of the close of business for each day during the calendar quarter 
the fdic has the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment  if certain conditions are met 
dif insured institutions pay a financing corporation fico assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued in the s in connection with the failures in the thrift industry 
for the fourth quarter of  the fico assessment was equal to basis points computed on assets as required by the dodd frank act 
these assessments will continue until the bonds mature in the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by fdic insured institutions 
it is also authorized to terminate a depository bank s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the bank s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank would have a material adverse effect on our earnings  operations and financial condition 
transactions with affiliates 
fii and fsb are affiliates within the meaning of the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve act imposes limitations on a bank with respect to extensions of credit to  investments in  and certain other transactions with  its parent bank holding company and the holding company s other subsidiaries 
furthermore  bank loans and extensions of credit to affiliates also are subject to various collateral requirements 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act  every fdic insured institution is obligated  consistent with safe and sound banking practices  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the community reinvestment act requires the appropriate federal banking regulator  in connection with the examination of an insured institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider this record in its evaluation of certain applications  such as a merger or the establishment of a branch 
an unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application and will prevent a bank holding company of the institution from making an election to become a financial holding company 
as of its last community reinvestment act examination  the bank received a rating of outstanding 
interstate branching 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  national and state chartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state eg  a host state by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch 
applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator 
privacy rules 
federal banking regulators  as required under the gramm leach bliley act  have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non affiliated third parties 
the privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
anti terrorism legislation 
the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act usa patriot act  enacted in prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks  imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals  requires financial institutions to establish an anti money laundering aml compliance program  and generally eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports 
the usa patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records 
the department of the treasury is empowered to administer and make rules to implement the act  which to some degree  affects our record keeping and reporting expenses 
should the bank s aml compliance program be deemed insufficient by federal regulators  we would not be able to grow through acquiring other institutions or opening de novo branches 

table of contents volcker rule 
the dodd frank act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances  and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent of tier capital in private equity and hedge funds known as the volcker rule 
the federal reserve released a final rule on february  effective on april  which requires a banking entity  a term that is defined to include bank holding companies like the parent  to bring its proprietary trading activities and investments into compliance with the dodd frank act restrictions no later than two years after the earlier of july   or months after the date on which interagency final rules are adopted 
pursuant to the compliance date final rule  banking entities are permitted to request an extension of this timeframe from the federal reserve 
on october   the federal banking agencies released for comment proposed regulations implementing the volcker rule 
the public comment period closed on february  and a final rule has not yet been published 
the parent will be reviewing the implications of the interagency rules on its investments once those rules are issued and will plan for any adjustments of its activities or its holdings in order to be in compliance by the announced compliance date 
ability to repay and qualified mortgage rule 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the cfpb issued a final rule on january  effective on january   amending regulation z as implemented by the truth in lending act  requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms 
mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways 
the first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision current or reasonably expected income or assets  current employment status  the monthly payment on the covered transaction  the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan  the monthly payment for mortgage related obligations  current debt obligations  alimony  and child support  the monthly debt to income ratio or residual income  and credit history 
alternatively  the mortgage lender can originate qualified mortgages  which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability to repay requirements 
in general  a qualified mortgage is a mortgage loan without negative amortization  interest only payments  balloon payments  or terms exceeding years 
in addition  to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed of the total loan amount 
qualified mortgages that are higher priced eg subprime loans garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rules  while qualified mortgages that are not higher priced eg prime loans are given a safe harbor of compliance 
incentive compensation policies and restrictions 
in july  the federal banking agencies issued guidance that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies thereby including both the parent company and the bank 
pursuant to the guidance  to be consistent with safety and soundness principles  a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward  be compatible with effective controls and risk management  and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organization s board of directors 
monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation 
in addition  in march  the federal banking agencies  along with the federal housing finance agency  and the sec  released a proposed rule intended to ensure that regulated financial institutions design their incentive compensation arrangements to account for risk 
specifically  the proposed rule would require compensation practices at the parent company and at the bank to be consistent with the following principles compensation arrangements appropriately balance risk and financial reward  such arrangements are compatible with effective controls and risk management  and such arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance 
in addition  financial institutions with billion or more in assets would be required to have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the rule and would be required to submit annual reports to their primary federal regulator 
the comment period has closed but a final rule has not yet been published 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of implemented a broad range of corporate governance  accounting and reporting measures for companies that have securities registered under the exchange act  including publicly held bank holding companies such as financial institutions 
specifically  the sarbanes oxley act of and the various regulations promulgated thereunder  established  among other things i requirements for audit committees  including independence  expertise  and responsibilities  ii responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company  iii the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of the reporting company s securities by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer in the twelve month period following the initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  iv the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  v standards for auditors and regulation of audits  including independence provisions that restrict non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  vi disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and their directors and executive officers  including accelerated reporting of stock transactions and a prohibition on trading during pension blackout periods  vii a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers  except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements  and viii a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws 

table of contents consumer laws and regulations 
in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include  among others  the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the home mortgage disclosure act and the real estate settlement procedures act 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
the check clearing for the st century act the check act  which became effective on october   creates a new negotiable instrument  called a substitute check  which banks are required to accept as the legal equivalent of a paper check if it meets the requirements of the check act 
the check act is designed to facilitate check truncation  to foster innovation in the check payment system  and to improve the payment system by shortening processing times and reducing the volume of paper checks 
other future legislation and changes in regulations 
in addition to the specific proposals described above  from time to time  various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as by regulatory agencies 
such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system 
such legislation could change banking statutes our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted  and  if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business 
impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally using historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
in our view  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are generally influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
regulatory and economic policies our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the frb regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are i conducting open market operations in us government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason  the policies of the frb could have a material effect on our earnings 
employees at december   we had employees 
none of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and management believes its relations with employees are good

table of contents item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report on form k is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
further  to the extent that any of the information contained in this annual report on form k constitutes forward looking statements  the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
credit risks if we experience greater credit losses than anticipated  earnings may be adversely impacted 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral  and we provide an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  if our assumptions or judgments are wrong  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover the actual credit losses 
we may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators  to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions  or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio 
the actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions 
geographic concentration may unfavorably impact our operations 
substantially all of our business and operations are concentrated in the western and central new york region 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas 
deterioration in economic conditions in our market could increase loan delinquencies  increase problem assets and foreclosures  increase claims and lawsuits  decrease the demand for our products and services  and decrease the value of collateral for loans  especially real estate  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  the value of assets associated with non performing loans and collateral coverage 
generally  we make loans to small to mid sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market areas could reduce our growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect our business  financial condition and performance 
for example  we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of these loans inadequately collateralized 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  the impact on our results of operations could be materially adverse 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about or from customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports  and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties  or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports  or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage regardless of whether we knew  had reason to know of  or caused the release of such substance 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our indirect lending involves risk elements in addition to normal credit risk 
a portion of our current lending involves the purchase of consumer automobile installment sales contracts from automobile dealers located in western  central and the capital district of new york  and northern pennsylvania 
these loans are for the purchase of new or used automobiles 
we serve customers that cover a range of creditworthiness  and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles 
while these loans have higher yields than many of our other loans  such loans involve risks elements in addition to normal credit risk 
potential risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through dealers  the absence of assured continued employment of the borrower  the varying general creditworthiness of the borrower  changes in the local economy  and difficulty in monitoring collateral 
while indirect automobile loans are secured  such loans are secured by depreciating assets and characterized by ltv ratios that could result in us not recovering the full value of an outstanding loan upon default by the borrower 
if the economic environment in our primary market area contracts  we may experience higher levels of delinquencies  charge offs and repossessions 
regulatory legal compliance risks we are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by changes in banking laws  regulations and regulatory practices 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination 
this regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing consumer credit  and anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws  but also capital adequacy  asset quality and risk  management ability and performance  earnings  liquidity  and various other factors 
as part of this regulatory structure  we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
under this structure the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine  among other things  that our operations are unsafe or unsound  fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies 
this supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct  growth and profitability of our operations 
any failure on our part to comply with current laws  regulations  other regulatory requirements or safe and sound banking practices or concerns about our financial condition  or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us  could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation 
ongoing financial reform legislation may result in new regulations that could require us to maintain higher capital levels and or increase our costs of operations or limit certain activities or lines of business 
the dodd frank act has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the rulemaking of the dodd frank act will not be known for many months or years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us 
however  compliance with this new law and its implementing regulations are expected to result in additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the federal banking agencies have proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules 
the proposed rules implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
the proposed rules include new minimum risk based capital and leverage ratios  which would be phased in over the next several years and would refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
while the proposed basel iii changes and other regulatory capital requirements will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards  it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to the company and the bank 

table of contents new or changing tax  accounting  and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact our strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a company s stockholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in the section captioned supervision and regulation included in part i  item  business 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
operational risks if our security systems  or those of merchants  merchant acquirers or other third parties containing information about customers  are compromised  we may be subject to liability and damage to our reputation 
as part of our business  we collect  process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties 
customer data also may be stored on systems of third party service providers and merchants that may have inadequate security systems 
third party carriers regularly transport customer data  and may lose sensitive customer information 
unauthorized access to our networks or any of our other information systems potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our customers or others 
if our security systems or those of merchants  processors or other third party service providers are compromised such that this confidential information is disclosed to unauthorized parties  we may be subject to liability 
for example  in the event of a security breach  we may incur losses related to fraudulent use of debit cards issued by us as well as the operational costs associated with reissuing cards 
although we take preventive measures to address these factors  such measures are costly and may become more costly in the future 
moreover  these measures may not protect us from liability  which may not be adequately covered by insurance  or from damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 
as part of our normal operations  we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations 
we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity  including misappropriation of assets  fraudulent financial reporting  and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected 
our systems or our third party service providers systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code  or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 
such disclosure could  among other things seriously damage our reputation  allow competitors access to our proprietary business information  subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data  result in the loss of our existing customers  subject us to regulatory action  and require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure 
third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and core application processing 
while we have selected these third party vendors carefully  we do not control their actions 
any problems caused by these third parties  including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively 
replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people and our ongoing leadership transition may be unsuccessful 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain skilled people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense  and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them 
further  the rural location of our principal executive offices and many of our bank branches make it difficult for us to attract skilled people to such locations 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our markets  years of industry experience  and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
on january   we eliminated the position of retail banking executive previously held by john j 
witkowski  our former executive vice president and on june   george d 
hagi  our executive vice president and chief risk officer retired and was replaced by kenneth v 
winn 
in august  peter g 
humphrey retired as our president and chief executive officer 
following mr 
humphrey s retirement  our board of directors appointed john e 
benjamin to serve as interim chief executive officer in august at the same time  we also announced the promotion of richard harrison as chief operating officer and martin birmingham as president and chief of community banking 
in march  mr 
birmingham was appointed to the position of president and chief executive officer 
these changes in key management could create uncertainty among our employees  customers  and other third parties with whom we do business and could result in changes to the strategic direction of our business  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure of our management to work together to effectively manage our operations  our inability to hire other key management  and any failure to effectively integrate new management into our controls  systems and procedures could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the potential for business interruption exists throughout our organization 
integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems  operational infrastructure  relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in our day to day and ongoing operations 
failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size  scale and scope 
this includes  but is not limited to  operational or technical failures  ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected  as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly 
although management has established policies and procedures  including implementation and testing of a comprehensive contingency plan  to address such failures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
a key component of our strategy to grow and improve profitability is to expand our branch network into communities within or adjacent to markets where we currently conduct business 
we intend to continue to pursue a growth strategy for our business 
as a result  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt  or equity securities may occur at any time 
we seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar  have experienced management  and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale  or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves potential adverse impact to our financial results and various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things difficulty in estimating the value of the target company  payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term  potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  there may be volatility in reported income as goodwill impairment losses could occur irregularly and in varying amounts  challenge and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  inability to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 

table of contents external risks we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio and other interest earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
also  our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet 
our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
from december through june  the us economy was in recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the us was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and reduced tax collections 
market conditions also led to the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which  in turn  has led to past increases in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
our financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer  is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate  in the state of new york and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the policies of the federal reserve impact us significantly 
the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold 
those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing 
changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
federal reserve policies can also affect our borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
for example  a tightening of the money supply by the federal reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower s products and services 
this could adversely affect the borrower s earnings and ability to repay its loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
under current accounting standards  goodwill is not amortized but  instead  is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
significant and sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization  significant declines in our expected future cash flows  significant adverse changes in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in impairment of goodwill 
during  the annual impairment test performed as of september indicated that the fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
in the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired  a non cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital 
at december   we had goodwill of million  representing approximately of shareholders equity 
for further discussion  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting  and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  and other external events could significantly impact our business 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue  and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity risks liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of cash 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us 
our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity 
in such events  our cost of funds may increase  thereby reducing our net interest income  or we may need to sell a portion of our investment and or loan portfolio  which  depending upon market conditions  could result in us realizing a loss 

table of contents we may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
in addition  we are highly regulated  and our regulators could require us to raise additional common equity in the future 
we and our regulators perform a variety of analyses of our assets  including the preparation of stress case scenarios  and as a result of those assessments we could determine  or our regulators could require us  to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers  depositors of the bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets  or a downgrade of our debt rating  may adversely affect our capital costs and ability to raise capital and  in turn  our liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from dividends from our bank subsidiary 
these dividends are the principal source of funds we use to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock  and to pay interest and principal on our debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary and nonbank subsidiary may pay to us 
also  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event our bank subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service debt  pay obligations  or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock 
the inability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks related to an investment in our common stock the market price for our common stock varies  and you should purchase common stock for long term investment only 
although our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market  we cannot assure you that there will  at any time in the future  be an active trading market for our common stock 
even if there is an active trading market for our common stock  we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell all of your shares of common stock at one time or at a favorable price  if at all 
as a result  you should purchase shares of common stock described herein only if you are capable of  and seeking  to make a long term investment in our common stock 
we may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation  which could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets  or by issuing additional debt or equity securities  which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper  medium term notes  senior notes  subordinated notes  preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities 
in the event of our liquidation  our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings 
further  market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future 
we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and certain banking laws may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and federal and state banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may discourage others from initiating a potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
