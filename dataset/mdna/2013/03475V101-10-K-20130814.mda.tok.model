overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of medical  surgical and diagnostic devices used by professional healthcare providers for vascular access  for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and for use in oncology and surgical settings 
our devices are generally used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures 
most of our products are intended to be used once and then discarded  or they may be temporarily implanted for short or long term use 
effective june   we consider our business to be a single segment entity the development  manufacture and sale on a global basis of medical devices for vascular access  surgery  peripheral vascular disease and oncology 
our chief operating decision maker ceo evaluates the various global product portfolios on a net sales basis 
executives reporting in to the ceo include those responsible for operations and supply chain management  research and development  sales  franchise marketing and certain corporate functions 
the ceo evaluates profitability  investment and cash flow metrics on a consolidated worldwide basis due to shared infrastructure and resources 
prior to fiscal year  our business was organized as two segments vascular and oncology surgery  each under the direction of a general manager with direct responsibility for all sales  marketing and product development activities 

table of contents our principal competitive advantages are our dedicated market focus  established brands and innovative products 
we believe our dedicated focus enhances patient care and engenders loyalty among our customers 
as a provider of interventional devices for over two decades  we believe we have established angiodynamics brands as premium performance products 
we collaborate frequently with leading interventional physicians in developing our products and rely on these relationships to further support our brands 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years ending may  net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales peripheral vascular access vascular oncology surgery total we sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force and outside the us through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships 
for fiscal years  and  net sales outside the us were  and  respectively 
our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
we recognize the importance of  and intend to continue to make investments in  research and development 
for fiscal  and  our research and development r d expenditures were million  million and million  respectively  and constituted  and  respectively  of net sales 
r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products  manage clinical  regulatory and medical affairs and our intellectual property 
we are also seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in january  we completed the acquisition of rita medical systems  inc  or rita  which established our position  we believe  as the only company focused on minimally invasive treatments for cancer patients with an emphasis on the growing segment of interventional oncology 
the acquisition created a diversified medical technology company with a broad line of access  diagnostic and therapeutic products that enable interventional physicians and surgeons to treat vascular disease and cancerous tumors 
interventional oncology continues to be a large and growing market 
in addition  in may we acquired the nanoknife ablation system which is complementary to our diverse offering of local oncology therapies  including market leading rfa systems and habib sealer resection devices 
in june  we completed the acquisition of certain us and uk assets of diomed  inc with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
in may  we completed the acquisition of navilyst  providing us with entry into the fluid management business with a market leading product line and significantly enhancing our presence in the vascular access market 
on october   we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of vortex medical  inc  a privately held company focused on the development and commercialization of medical devices for venous drainage and the removal of thrombus  or blood clots  from occluded blood vessels 
on march   we established a strategic relationship with  and on february   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of  microsulis medical ltd  a uk based company specializing in minimally invasive microwave ablation technology 

table of contents except to the extent we can further use our cash on hand  revolver capacity or equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any future significant acquisitions 
for fiscal  approximately of our product sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared with for fiscal  and for fiscal the percentage decrease in fiscal was due to the increase in revenue from navilyst products combined with decreased sales of lc beads  a product which we ceased distributing on december  the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decreased sales of lc beads 
we intend to manufacture more products in house to lower product costs and increase profitability 
our ability to increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
recent developments acquisition of microsulis medical ltd 
on march   we established a strategic relationship with microsulis medical ltd 
microsulis  a uk based company specializing in minimally invasive  microwave ablation technology for the coagulation of soft tissue 
the relationship included an initial million investment in microsulis through the purchase of senior preferred stock  representing a ownership position  exclusive distribution rights to market and sell their microwave ablation systems in all markets outside the united states from may through december  and an exclusive option to purchase at any time until september   substantially all of the global assets of microsulis medical  ltd 
on february   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of microsulis  which we have accounted for as a business combination  for cash payments at closing totaling million  subject to a working capital adjustment  a million payment due on december  and potential additional cash consideration payable upon performance over the next nine years 
we also assumed million of liabilities 
the total estimated purchase consideration of million included the initial investment of million  closing payments totaling million  a million payment due on december  and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration earn out of million 
the estimated fair value of contingent consideration is based on projected net sales over the nine year period following the closing of the acquisition 
the amount of the earn out consideration that could be paid on net sales is not limited 
the estimated purchase consideration exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets by million and was recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
during the fiscal year ended may   we incurred acquisition related costs of thousand  which were expensed to acquisition  restructuring and other items  net in the statement of operations 
we have not finalized the purchase accounting  which may be adjusted as further information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 
acquisition of vortex medical inc on october   we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of vortex medical  inc  a privately held company focused on the development and commercialization of medical devices for venous drainage and the removal of thrombus  or blood clots  from occluded blood vessels 
vortex s principal product is the angiovac system  which includes the angiovac cannula and circuit 
the angiovac cannula has a proprietary balloon 
table of contents actuated  expandable  funnel shaped distal tip that enhances flow  prevents clogging of the cannula and facilitates en bloc  or whole removal of undesirable intravascular material 
both the angiovac cannula and circuit are fda cleared for use during extracorporeal bypass for up to hours 
an application for ce mark approval has been filed 
the total estimated purchase consideration of million included an upfront payment of million and the estimated fair value of contingent earn out consideration of million  million of which is guaranteed 
the estimated fair value of contingent consideration is based on projected angiovac net sales in the ten year period following the closing 
the amount of the earn out consideration that could be paid on angiovac net sales is not limited 
the estimated purchase consideration exceeded the fair value of the acquired net assets by million and was recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately years as revenues are earned from the sales of related products 
during the fiscal year ended may   we incurred acquisition related costs of thousand  which were expensed to acquisition  restructuring and other items  net in the statement of operations 
we have not finalized the purchase accounting  which may be adjusted as further information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 
acquisition of navilyst on may    we completed the acquisition of privately held navilyst  a global medical device company with strengths in the vascular access  interventional radiology and interventional cardiology markets 
the acquisition and related transaction costs were financed through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock  million in drawn acquisition debt financing and million of cash 
based on the closing price of our stock of on the day prior to the transaction  the purchase price was approximately million 
the fiscal year ended may  and  included million and million  respectively  in transaction and severance costs related to the navilyst acquisition 
these costs are included in acquisition  restructuring and other items  net in the statement of operations 
investment funds affiliated with avista capital partners  former owners of navilyst  received approximately million shares of our common stock and  as of may   held approximately of our outstanding shares 
investment funds affiliated with avista capital partners entered into a stockholders agreement with us as part of the transaction and also appointed two additional directors to our existing board of directors 
to satisfy any working capital adjustment and potential indemnification claims that may arise  million of purchase consideration had been placed in escrow  including approximately million in cash and approximately thousand shares of common stock  determined based on the closing price of on the day prior to the transaction 
the indemnification claims period will terminate on july  at may   we had million of receivable related to the working capital adjustment recorded as escrow receivable on the balance sheet 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we received million of cash from the escrow fund to satisfy this receivable 
goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition was million 
intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  totaled approximately million  of which million has been identified as customer relationships year weighted average useful life  million of trademarks of which million has been determined to have an indefinite useful life and the remaining million has a year weighted average useful life  million of in process research and development indefinite useful life until completed and million of technology year weighted average useful life 
the ipr d assets  which were accounted for as indefinite lived assets at the time of acquisition  represent the development of a biomedical polymer additive for use in picc and other vascular access product lines and a power injectable port which are valued at million and million  respectively 
the biomedical polymer 
table of contents additive product recently received regulatory approval and the product was released in the united states in october and is being amortized over a year useful life 
the power injectable port is expected to be released in the united states in fiscal  subject to regulatory approvals 
the fair value of these intangible assets was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk  utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
discontinuance of benephit product offering during the third fiscal quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our benephit product offering 
accordingly  we recorded million of expenses during the year ended may  these costs are included in acquisition  restructuring and other items  net in the statement of operations 
closure of uk facility during the first fiscal quarter of  we made the decision to close our cambridge  uk facility and transfer the production of lasers to our queensbury  ny facility 
we completed the transfer in january the total cost of this project was approximately million 
the statement of operations for the year ended may  included charges of million for costs incurred associated with this closure and included million for fiscal the charge is included in acquisition  restructuring and other items  net in the statement of operations 
regulatory matters on may   we received a warning letter from fda in connection with its inspection of our queensbury  ny manufacturing facility 
in the warning letter  fda cited deficiencies in the response letter we provided fda pertaining to the inspection that occurred from january to january  the deficiencies related to our internal procedures for medical device reporting  corrections and removals and complaint handling 
we responded to the warning letter and completed corrective and preventive actions to address the observations noted 
in december  we initiated a comprehensive quality call to action program to review and augment our quality management systems at our queensbury facility 
to accelerate implementation of the program  we engaged a team of external regulatory and quality experts and reallocated a significant number of engineering and product development resources to support this corporate initiative 
from inception of the quality call to action program through fiscal  we have incurred million in direct costs associated with the program 
on february   we received from fda a form  list of investigational observations  in connection with its inspection of our queensbury facility from november  to february  the form contained observations related to  among other things  our capa corrective and preventive action system  mdr medical device reporting  complaint investigation  corrections and removals  acceptance criteria and training 
some of the observations contained in the form were repeat observations from the may  warning letter 
on february   we received from fda a form in connection with its inspection of our fremont facility from january  to february  the form contained six observations related to  among other things  our capa system  design controls  risk management and training 
we provided responses to fda within business days of our receipt of the form s 
on september   we received from fda a form in connection with its subsequent inspection of our queensbury  ny facility from september to september  and september to september this re inspection followed our response to the original form issued by fda on february  the form contained observations related to k decisions  complaint investigations  acceptance criteria  corrective and preventive actions and training 
all but one of the observations in the form related to events that occurred 
table of contents before the date that we had indicated to fda in our previous responses that our corrective and remediation activities related to our quality call to action would be completed 
we provided responses to fda within business days of our receipt of the form on november   fda completed an inspection of our manchester  ga facility and no form observations were issued 
in june  we received approval from fda to conduct a clinical trial to study the use of the nanoknife in the treatment of focal prostate cancer 
we are moving forward with institutional review board irb submissions and anticipate commencing patient enrollment during our second quarter of fiscal  which ends november  we will continue to work closely with fda to resolve any outstanding issues 
unless the items raised in the previously disclosed warning letters and form s are corrected to fda s satisfaction or we come to some other arrangement with fda finally resolving such matters  we may be subject to additional regulatory or legal action  including the issuance of warning letters  injunction  seizure or recall of products  imposition of fines or penalties or operating restrictions on our facilities 
such actions could significantly disrupt our ongoing business and operations and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s authoritative guidance on revenue recognition which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectability are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title and risk of loss passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
we chose to early adopt  effective with the third quarter of fiscal  updated authoritative guidance for revenue recognition relating to the accounting treatment for revenue arrangements that involve more than one deliverable or unit of accounting 
at the same time  we also adopted the updated guidance relating to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
neither of these had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit 
table of contents evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs of accounts receivable have been insignificant 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of operations 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of may   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 
we have a total of million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards remaining from acquisitions 
these losses could be significantly limited under internal revenue code irc section our analysis of acquisitions ownership changes as defined in irc section shows that approximately million of remaining federal net operating losses and million of remaining state net operating losses will expire prior to utilization 
the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses reflects this limitation 
in order to ensure the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we need to generate million of taxable income for the next ten years and then million of taxable income for the final eight years of the remaining eighteen year carryforward period 
if we are unable to meet these minimum taxable levels  the deferred tax assets may still be utilized in future years if we can make up previous year taxable income short falls prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined that we have sufficient existing levels of pre tax earnings to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheets 
in order to support the realizability of our net deferred tax asset  we projected our pre tax income utilizing a combination of historical and projected results 
utilizing this projected pre tax income  we have projected taxable income taking into consideration existing levels of permanent differences including stock option exercise deductions and non deductible expenses and the reversal of significant temporary differences 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards as of may   after considering irc section limitations  are million 
the expiration of the federal net operating loss carryforwards are as follows million between and  million between and and million between and our state net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering remaining irc section limitations are million which expire in various years from to we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and in february which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during fiscal year  new york state completed an examination of our new york state franchise tax 
table of contents returns for fiscal years to in relation to this examination  income tax expense in fiscal includes an out of period benefit of  to correct an error that originated in prior years related to certain state tax credits 
additionally  as a result of the audit  we were able to claim state tax credits of  that are recorded in fiscal year fiscal years through remain open to examination by the various tax authorities 
new york state is currently auditing navilyst s franchise tax filings for through  we do not anticipate any material adjustments will result 
we analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income taxes  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and we do not anticipate any adjustments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history  and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
in conjunction with the navilyst acquisition  the acquired inventory was stepped up to its net realizable value and was expensed in cost of goods sold in the statement of operations based on inventory turns 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may result in impairment and or significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range between three and twenty years  on either a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
acquired ipr d has an indefinite life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project  at which time the ipr d becomes an amortizable asset 
if the related project is not completed in a timely manner or the project is terminated or abandoned  we may have an impairment related to the ipr d  calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net 
table of contents cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
at the time of acquisition  we expect that all acquired ipr d will reach technological feasibility  but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability of these products will actually be achieved 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  and conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials  delay or failure to obtain required market clearances  or delays or issues with patent issuance  or validity and litigation 
if commercial viability were not achieved  we would likely look to other alternatives to provide these therapies 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather  are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets have been recorded at either incurred or allocated cost 
allocated costs were based on respective fair market values at the date of acquisition 
we have one intangible asset which has been assigned an indefinite life  the namic trademark that was recently acquired as part of our acquisition of navilyst  and is valued at million 
for goodwill  the impairment test requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
effective june   we consider our business to be a single operating segment entity the development  manufacture and sale on a global basis of medical devices for vascular access  surgery  peripheral vascular disease and oncology 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
for fiscal  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax 
for fiscal  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax 
for fiscal  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax 

table of contents under the provisions of the guidance adopted  we expect to recognize the following future expense for awards granted prior to may  in thousands unrecognized compensation cost weighted average remaining vesting period in years stock options non vested stock awards unrecognized compensation cost for stock options is presented net of assumed annual forfeitures 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest annually  and we have therefore applied a annual forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation charge recorded 
we will re evaluate this estimate periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate on a prospective basis as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
for the fiscal years ended may   may  and may   we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes as our method of valuation and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  and a risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we utilize our historical volatility when estimating expected stock price volatility 
we use yield rates on us treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the expected term is based on our actual historical results 
the dividend yield is based on the history and expectation of dividend payments 
we have not paid dividends in the past nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
our historical data includes information from may   the date of our initial public offering

the fiscal results reported net income of million  or per diluted common share  on net sales of million 
the fiscal results included million in acquisition costs  million in costs associated with the closure of the cambridge  uk facility  million in impairment costs associated with a discontinuance of a product offering and million in litigation costs 
the fiscal results included acquisition costs of million  million in ceo and executive transition costs  and million related to the pending closure of the uk facility 
the fiscal results included million of impairment charges related to our decision to not continue development of the medron lightport technology and the write down of centros prepaid royalties due to lower than anticipated sales 
gross profit was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal fiscal gross margin was reduced by million of acquired inventory basis step up related to our recent acquisition activity and approximately million relating to our quality call to action program 
fiscal gross margin was reduced by approximately million in product recall costs and approximately million in costs relating to the quality call to action program 
for and  we were able to use net operating losses nols accumulated by acquired companies to offset the amount of cash we paid for federal and state income taxes 
the cash benefit amounted to approximately million and million for the years ended may  and may  we did not use 
table of contents net operating losses in under purchase accounting rules  the use of acquired nols is accounted for in deferred tax assets  therefore  the related cash tax savings is not reflected in our provision for income taxes in the statements of operations 
fiscal years ended may  and may  net sales 
net sales are derived from the sale of our products and related freight charges  less discounts and estimated sales returns and allowances 
net sales for fiscal of million  increased over fiscal sales of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to sales of products acquired in the navilyst acquisition and microwave products  partially offset by the absence of lc beads sales following the end of distribution rights on december  lc bead sales were million during fiscal from a product line perspective  peripheral vascular sales increased million or from the prior year period to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to sales of navilyst fluid management products 
vascular access sales were million  an increase of million or from the prior year period 
this increase is attributable to sales of navilyst piccs and port products 
oncology surgery sales were million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributed to the decrease in lc beads sales described earlier  partially offset by increased nanoknife and microwave product sales 
nanoknife sales totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal from a geographic perspective  us sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  despite the cessation of the distribution of lc beads in december the addition of product revenue from the navilyst acquisition was the primary driver of the increase 
international sales were million in fiscal  double the million of reported sales in fiscal products acquired in the navilyst acquisition were responsible for the majority of the increase along with microwave product sales 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold  which includes the costs of materials  products purchased from third parties and sold by us  manufacturing personnel  royalties  freight  business insurance  depreciation of property and equipment and other manufacturing overhead 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in costs for step up in inventory associated with the navilyst acquisition and a full year inclusions of the navilyst products which yield lower gross profit 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products  manage clinical  regulatory and medical affairs and our intellectual property 
r d expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased r d personnel and projects following the navilyst acquisition 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal sales and marketing expenses

recent accounting pronouncements in june and december  the fasb updated the disclosure requirements for comprehensive income 
the updated guidance requires companies to disclose the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated guidance does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
the updated guidance is effective annual periods  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  our fiscal year 
we have provided the disclosure in a separate statement herein 
the adoption of this guidance had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment 
this update permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a 
table of contents reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the quantitative assessment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year however  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update permits an entity to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
this update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after september  our fiscal year however early adoption is permitted  provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test or issued its financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in december and january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to disclosures on offsetting assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
the newly issued accounting standard requires an entity to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions executed under a master netting  or similar  arrangement and was issued to enable users of financial statements to understand the effects or potential effects of those arrangements on its financial position 
this guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january  our fiscal year 
since the guidance only impacts disclosure requirements  its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb expanded the disclosure requirements related to changes in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the new guidance requires disclosure of the amount of income or loss reclassified out of aoci to each respective line item on the statement of operations where net income is presented 
the guidance allows disclosure of the reclassification either in the notes to the financial statements or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements 
this requirement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
since the guidance only impacts disclosure requirements  its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this new pronouncement provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  or similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year 
since the guidance only impacts presentation requirements  its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into interest rate swaps with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change on our variable interest rate financings  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
as part of the navilyst acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks which provided for a million senior secured term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving credit 
table of contents facility 
the million in proceeds from the term loan were used to finance a portion of the consideration for the acquisition 
the revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes in the future  but was not utilized as of may  both facilities have five year maturities 
the term facility has a quarterly repayment schedule equal to    and of its principal amount in years one through five 
interest on both the term loan and revolving loan will be based on a base rate or eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin which increases as our total leverage ratio increases  and with the base rate and eurodollar rate having ranges of to and to respectively 
in the event of default  the interest rate may be increased by 
the revolving facility will also carry a commitment fee of to per year on the unused portion 
the credit agreement includes  among other standard provisions  two financial covenants 
the first financial covenant requires us to maintain  as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters  a ratio of i consolidated ebitda minus consolidated capital expenditures to ii consolidated interest expense paid or payable in cash plus scheduled principal payments in respect of indebtedness under the credit agreement of not less than to 
the second financial covenant requires us to maintain  as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters  a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of not more than the applicable ratios as set forth in the credit agreement 
nearly all of our sales have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
although not significant  we transact sales in other currencies  particularly the euro  gb pound and canadian dollar 
approximately of our sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and gb pound 
we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange risk and such risk in the future is expected to be modest 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities primarily of less than two years 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
we hold investments in auction rate securities ars in order to generate higher than typical money market investments 
ars typically are high credit quality  generally achieved with municipal bond insurance 
credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers  which back a majority of this market 
sell orders for any security traded through an auction process could exceed bids 
such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issuer credit quality 
should there be a failed auction  we may be unable to liquidate our position in the securities in the near term 
we have million in investments in two auction rate securities issued by new york state and local government authorities that have failed auctions 
the authorities are current in their interest payments on the securities 
we are party to legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business as described in note n
