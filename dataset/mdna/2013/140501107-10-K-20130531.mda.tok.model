table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical fact  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risks factors in part i of this report 
results of operations the composite measure of our financial performance in the consolidated statements of operations is captioned increase in net assets from operations and consists of three elements 
the first is net investment income  which is the difference between income from interest  dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses  net of applicable income taxes 
the second element is net realized gain on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost  net of applicable income tax expense based on our tax year 
the third element is the net increase in unrealized appreciation of investments  which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio  compared with stated cost 
it should be noted that the net realized gain on investments and net increase in unrealized appreciation of investments are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain  a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized to being realized 
conversely  when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security  an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs

increase in dividend income was primarily due to tax year end dividend income from both rectorseal corporation and the whitmore manufacturing corporation our principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation 
therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential return from equity participation and  therefore  provides minimal current yield in the form of interest or dividends

transfer taxes in the amount of  related to the transfer of real estate were deducted from the realized gain on the lifemark transaction 
management does not attempt to maintain a consistent level of realized gains from year to year  but instead attempts to maximize total investment portfolio appreciation 
this strategy often dictates the long term holding of portfolio securities in pursuit of increased values and increased unrealized appreciation  but may at opportune times dictate realizing gains or losses through the disposition of certain portfolio investments 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation of investments for the twelve months ended march   we recorded an increase in unrealized appreciation of investments of  in  an increase in unrealized appreciation of investments of  in fy and an increase in unrealized appreciation of investments of  in fy as explained in the first paragraph of results of operations above  the realization of gains or losses results in a corresponding decrease or increase in unrealized appreciation of investments
