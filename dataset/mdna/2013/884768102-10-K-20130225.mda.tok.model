overview we are a growing  diversified north american mining company 
we are a significant molybdenum supplier to the global steel and chemicals sectors 
we are diversifying into copper and gold with the construction and development of our mt 
milligan project mt 
milligan in british columbia  which is expected to start up in the third quarter of and to go into commercial production in the fourth quarter of our principal molybdenum producing properties are the thompson creek mine  an open pit molybdenum mine and concentrator in idaho the tc mine  the endako mine  an open pit molybdenum mine  concentrator and roaster in british columbia in which we own a joint venture interest the endako mine and the langeloth metallurgical facility in pennsylvania the langeloth facility 
in march  we completed a mill expansion project at the endako mine 
the new mill  which replaced a s era mill  increased ore processing capacity from  tons per day to  tons per day 
mt 
milligan will be an open pit copper and gold mine and concentrator 
mt 
milligan is designed to be a conventional truck shovel open pit mine with a  ton per day copper flotation processing plant 
mt 
milligan has estimated average annual production over the life of the mine of million pounds of copper and  ounces of gold  each in concentrate 
we also have a copper  molybdenum and silver exploration project located in british columbia the berg property  an underground molybdenum exploration property located in british columbia the davidson property  and a joint venture gold exploration project located in nunavut  canada the maze lake property 
during  we realized a net loss of million  primarily as a result of a million non cash write down of our share of the property  plant  equipment and development assets at the endako mine and a non cash goodwill impairment loss of million  representing the remaining balance of goodwill 
our share of the remaining fixed assets at the endako mine was million as of december  we realized an operating loss in of million  primarily as a result of the fixed asset write down at the endako mine 
this operating loss also resulted from declining molybdenum market prices  lower production and higher unit costs from our mines  as well as lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million of which million was recognized in operating expenses and million was recognized in depreciation  depletion and amortization during  and significantly lower sales volumes from our mines in due to lower production volumes 
production and costs during were negatively impacted by lower than anticipated ore grades and mill recovery rates at the endako mine and planned mine pit sequencing and waste stripping activities at the tc mine  as explained further below 
given the significant decline in molybdenum prices during and the performance of our two mines  we closely monitored and evaluated potential write downs throughout the year 
during the third quarter of  we suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at tc mine 
this decision and the decline in molybdenum prices represented significant changes in our business  requiring us to evaluate for potential impairments on an enterprise wide basis at september  for purposes of the impairment evaluation  management considered estimates of after tax discounted future cash flows of the individual reporting units  life of mine plans developed using long term analyst pricing reflective of 
table of contents the then current price environment  management projections for operating costs and the market value of our equity 
as a result of this evaluation  an impairment charge of million  representing the remaining balance of goodwill  was recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  both management view of future molybdenum prices and the long term analyst view of molybdenum prices were adjusted further downward 
in addition  due to certain operational issues at endako mine  as discussed further below  we revised our operating plan for endako for  and these revisions impacted the endako life of mine plan 
combined  these events constituted a triggering event  requiring us to evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
in accordance with us gaap  potential long lived asset impairments are assessed pursuant to a two step approach 
in evaluating potential long lived asset impairments  the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value computed using undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the assets being tested is greater than the undiscounted cash flows from that asset  then step two requires that we evaluate those assets for impairment 
the amount of the impairment is recorded based on the difference between the book value and the estimated fair value of the asset computed using discounted estimated future cash flows 
while the endako mine assets were evaluated during third quarter  no impairment loss on the endako assets was taken during the third quarter as the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets exceeded their carrying values step 
after the fourth quarter triggering event  this evaluation indicated that the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets step were less than their carrying values 
as a result  we were required  under us gaap  to measure the impairment loss step by comparing the carrying values of the endako mine assets to their discounted estimated future cash flows 
this evaluation resulted in a pre tax non cash write down of our share of the endako property  plant  equipment and development assets of million in the fourth quarter of our impairment analysis did not result in any other long lived asset impairments as of december  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be further asset write downs if we continue to experience operational challenges and or if commodity prices further decline 
at the endako mine  we experienced lower than anticipated ore grades and recovery during in addition  in late december and thus far in  we experienced and are experiencing tailings management issues associated with frozen water in the tailings pond 
we have been unable to feed sufficient water from the tailings pond to the new mill on a consistent basis  which has negatively impacted the rate and level of throughput of mined material to the mill and thus our production of molybdenum 
these issues led us to revise our operating plan for the endako mine for as of the date of this report  we have made modifications to the piping of tailings to the pond and have instituted other tailings management procedures to address these issues to ensure the availability of a sufficient supply of water to the mill for the future winter seasons beyond during the first half of and the last half of  our tc mine production was negatively impacted by planned mine pit sequencing in the transition from one phase of the mine plan phase to the next phase 
these planned sequencing activities included stripping and mining of significantly lower grade ore that resulted in lower mill throughput and lower mill recovery 
during this planned mine sequencing  cash costs were higher and production was lower than in and the first half of when we mined high grade ore primarily in the bottom of the pit and consequently achieved record molybdenum production 
in an effort to reduce costs at the tc mine  given recent declines in molybdenum prices and projected operating costs at tc mine for and thereafter  in october  we suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production phase 
this change in the mine plan resulted in a decline in cash costs and an increase in production during the fourth quarter of compared with the first nine months of that year 
we expect this revision to the mine plan to defer approximately million in operating costs and million in capital expenditures through the end of mining operations and production are expected to continue as planned through in the current phase of the mine 
we also expect to preserve the assets at tc mine to enable us to restart waste stripping of phase of the mine plan when market conditions warrant 
if waste stripping has not recommenced by  we expect that the mine would be placed on care and maintenance 
at december   we estimated future capital project cash expenditures of approximately c million for the mt 
milligan project through completion plus an additional c million to c million of estimated future cash capital expenditures for a permanent operations residence at mt 
milligan  which is expected to be completed in we believe that we have solidified our ability to finance these capital project expenditures with our million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents  the expected remaining proceeds from royal gold as defined below in liquidity and capital resources of million  the million net funding available under our equipment lease financing facility for the mobile mining fleet at mt 
milligan and our ongoing expected cash flow from operations 
our ability to fund the completion of the mt 
milligan project  satisfy our working capital needs and make our scheduled debt and interest payments depends on our future operating performance and cash flow including a successful start up of mt 
milligan in the last half of  average realized molybdenum  gold and copper prices and our ability to access our current 
table of contents funding sources  including our equipment lease financing and our gold stream arrangement as defined below in liquidity and capital resources with royal gold

total cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million as of december  total debt as of december  was  million  including capital lease obligations  compared to million as of december  outlook 
table of contents our financial results can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of molybdenum 
world market prices for molybdenum have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
during the fourth quarter of  the average platts metals week published price for molybdenum oxide was per pound  compared to per pound in the third quarter of  per pound in the second quarter of and per pound in the first quarter of while the monthly average price for molybdenum oxide for january was higher than at december  equaling per pound as published by platts metals week  since mid january  the monthly average price for molybdenum oxide has declined 
we anticipate that the price for molybdenum oxide will continue to be volatile 
any significant weakness in demand for molybdenum or reduction in molybdenum prices may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
in late december and thus far in  we experienced and are experiencing tailings management issues associated with frozen water in the tailings pond 
we have been unable to feed sufficient water from the tailings pond to the new mill on a consistent basis due to winter conditions  which has negatively impacted the rate and level of throughput of mined material to the mill and thus our production of molybdenum 
we expect that these issues will have a negative effect on our production and financial results from the endako mine in the first quarter of as of the date of this report  we have made modifications to the piping of tailings to the pond and have instituted other tailings management procedures to address these issues to ensure the availability of a sufficient supply of water to the mill for the future winter seasons beyond the key operating measures that management focuses on in operating our business are production  cash costs per pound produced and capital expenditures 
we continually review our operating strategy as commodity market conditions change 
we increased molybdenum inventory throughout by approximately million pounds as our production volume exceeded our sales contract volumes 
this excess production is expected to be sold over the course of we anticipate that the completion and start up of mt 
milligan will take place in the third quarter of  with commercial production of copper and gold beginning in the fourth quarter of we expect average annual production to be higher during the first full years of production approximately million pounds of copper and  ounces of gold both in concentrate  compared to annual life of mine production

financial review three months ended december  unaudited net loss income net loss for the fourth quarter of was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or nil per share for the fourth quarter of the net loss in the fourth quarter of was the result of a million pre tax non cash write down of our share of the property  plant  equipment and development assets at the endako mine partially offset by an income tax benefit 
additionally  lower average realized sales prices on molybdenum sold  unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and higher interest expense due to the termination of our revolving credit facility negatively impacted the quarter compared with the comparable period in  as discussed below 
non gaap adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of excluding the endako mine asset write down  net of tax impacts was million  or per share 
non gaap adjusted net income loss for the fourth quarter of which 
table of contents excludes the non cash unrealized gain on the warrants was nil  or nil per share 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of adjusted net income 
revenues revenues in the fourth quarter of were million  down compared to revenue in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of lower average realized sales prices 
the average realized sales price for molybdenum in the fourth quarter of was per pound  which was per pound  or  lower than the fourth quarter of we sold approximately million and million pounds of molybdenum  respectively  in the fourth quarters of and  of which million pounds and million pounds  respectively  were from our mines 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter of were million  which were down from the same quarter in the decrease in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of was driven by lower costs at the tc mine due to the suspension of waste stripping activities and mining of significantly higher grade ore compared with due to the planned mine pit sequencing discussed above 
partially offsetting this decline was the operating expense portion of the lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million in the fourth quarter of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of were impacted by lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million and a write down of surplus and obsolete materials and supplies inventory of million 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our mines was per pound in the fourth quarter of compared to per pound for the same quarter in cash cost per pound produced was lower in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of lower cash costs at the tc mine 
cash costs at the tc mine in the fourth quarter of were lower due to the absence of costs for waste stripping and higher production from a significantly higher ore grade  as discussed above 
these declines in cash costs were partially offset by higher cash costs at the endako mine associated with lower than expected recoveries from the new mill 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  there was million of accelerated depreciation for the old mill at the endako mine  which was depreciated down to salvage value as of the first quarter of additionally  the and fourth quarters included lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million and million  respectively 
on a per pound sold basis  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased slightly in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of higher depreciation of the new mill at the endako mine  which was completed in the first quarter of  which was partially offset by the accelerated depreciation of the old mill at the endako mine in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of was million  which increased million compared to the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of and included million of stock based compensation expense 
under us gaap  stock based compensation is included in the specific operating statement categories that include the compensation costs of the employees  officers and directors for which the stock based award applies 
exploration expense exploration expense for the fourth quarter of was million compared to million for the fourth quarter of the current quarter exploration expense includes million for the berg property and million for property payments on the davidson property with the remaining million related to other exploration activity 
the exploration expenses included million for the berg property  million of exploration drilling expenditures at tc mine  million for certain property payments  and million at the endako mine reflecting our share 
asset impairments given the significant decline in molybdenum prices during and the performance of our two mines  we closely monitored and evaluated potential write downs throughout the year 
during the fourth quarter of  both management view of future molybdenum prices and the long term analyst view of molybdenum prices were adjusted downward 
in addition  due to certain operational issues at endako mine  as discussed in overview  we revised our operating plan for endako for 
table of contents and these revisions impacted the endako life of mine plan 
combined  these events constituted a triggering event  requiring us to evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in the fourth quarter 
this evaluation indicated that the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets were less than their carrying values 
as a result  we were required  under us gaap  to measure the impairment loss by comparing the carrying values of the endako mine assets to their discounted estimated future cash flows 
this evaluation resulted in a pre tax non cash write down of our share of the endako property  plant  equipment and development assets of million in the fourth quarter of our remaining share of the property  plant  equipment and development assets was million as of december   which represents our share of the fair values of endako mine assets 
our impairment analysis did not result in any other long lived asset impairments as of december  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be further asset write downs if we continue to experience operational challenges and or if commodity prices further decline 
see overview for further discussion of the endako mine 
interest and finance fees following the termination of our revolving credit facility in the fourth quarter of  we expensed million in previously capitalized deferred financing fees related to the facility 
as a result  interest and finance fees increased to million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we capitalized million of interest and debt issuance costs 
foreign exchange gains and losses for the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million foreign exchange loss compared to a foreign exchange gain of million in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the c strengthened against the us  which resulted in an unrealized foreign exchange loss of million on intercompany notes that are denominated in a different currency than their measurement currency 
the offsetting exchange gain was the result of c cash balances that have the us as their measurement currency and us payables and receivables that have the c as their measurement currency 
the fourth quarter of foreign exchange gain of million was the result of an unrealized foreign exchange gain of million on intercompany notes that are denominated in a different currency than their measurement currency and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of million on foreign currency derivative instruments 
the remaining exchange loss was the result of c cash balances that have the us as their measurement currency and on us payables and receivables that have the c as their measurement currency 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c for the fourth quarter of compared to an average rate of us c for the same period in income and mining tax benefit expense for the fourth quarter of  we had a net tax benefit of million compared to a net tax benefit of million for the fourth quarter of the tax benefit for the fourth quarter of was primarily impacted by the impairment of our share of the assets at the endako mine 
as a result of the asset impairment  we recognized a tax benefit of million through a reduction of our associated deferred tax liabilities 
however  we also recognized a valuation allowance  in part as a result of the asset impairment  which reduced our net tax benefit on the endako mine deferred tax assets by million 
the tax benefit for the fourth quarter of was impacted by the non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants  which did not generate any income tax expense  and the us percentage depletion benefit 
prior to the fourth quarter of  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance related to the endako mine  we considered the reversal of our taxable temporary differences as a source of taxable income in order to fully realize all of the related benefits associated with the endako mine deferred tax assets 
with the asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  the associated taxable temporary differences were reduced 
as a result  we concluded in the fourth quarter that a portion of our deferred tax assets related to the endako mine will not be realized due to a lack of reversing taxable temporary differences 
three years ended december  net loss income net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  and net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the net loss for was the result of a million pre tax non cash write down of our share of the property  plant  equipment and development assets at the endako mine and a million impairment of goodwill 
additionally  results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by lower sales volume  lower 
table of contents average realized sales prices and higher cash costs in the period  as discussed below 
net loss for the year ended december  also included lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million  or per share  compared to lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million  or per share  in in  the market value of our inventory exceeded the carrying value and there were no lower of cost or market write downs 
in addition  net loss for the year ended december  included a non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share  compared to a non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share  in and a non cash unrealized loss on common stock purchase warrants of million  or per share in the non cash unrealized gains and losses on common stock purchase warrants for the years ended december   and were the result of a requirement under us gaap to account for outstanding common stock purchase warrants as a derivative  with changes in the fair market value recorded in net income 
all warrants had been exercised or expired as of june  net loss for the year ended december  also included gains on foreign exchange of million  or per share  which were primarily unrealized gains 
net income for the year ended december  included losses on foreign exchange of million  or per share  which were primarily unrealized losses  compared to realized foreign exchange gains of million  or per share  in non gaap adjusted net loss for the year ended december  excluding the endako mine asset write down net of tax effect  the goodwill impairment and non cash unrealized gain on the warrants was million  or per share 
non gaap adjusted net income for the year ended december  excluding the non cash unrealized gain on the warrants was million  or per share 
non gaap adjusted net income for the year ended december  excluding the non cash unrealized loss on the warrants was million  or per share 
the decrease in non gaap adjusted net loss in compared to was primarily the result of lower sales volumes  lower average realized molybdenum prices and higher cash costs per pound produced 
the decrease in non gaap adjusted net income for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily the result of higher operating expenses related to planned mine pit sequencing resulting in lower ore grades and lower production at our tc mine and lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million  which were partially offset by slightly higher sales volumes and higher average realized molybdenum prices 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of adjusted net loss income 
revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of compared to  driven by lower sales volumes and lower average realized sales prices 
during  we sold million pounds of molybdenum  which was million pounds less than the volume sold in declines in volume were the result of lower production at the tc mine due to lower grade ore as a result of planned mine pit sequencing and lower grade and recoveries at the endako mine 
the average realized sales price for molybdenum in was per pound  which was per pound lower than in tolling  calcining and other revenue  including revenue from toll roasted material for third parties  was million in  a decrease of million compared to million in as a result of the planned temporary shutdown of the langeloth facility for scheduled repairs and maintenance activities 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  which was higher than revenue 
the increase in revenue resulted from higher sales volumes and higher average realized sales prices 
we sold million pounds of molybdenum in  which was million pounds more than the volume sold in higher sales volume in resulted primarily from a draw down of mined production inventory from the tc mine and endako mine  and partly from higher sales volume of third party product that was purchased and sold 
the average realized sales price for molybdenum in was per pound  which was per pound higher compared to the average realized sales price for molybdenum in revenue from toll roasted material for third parties was million in  an increase of million compared to million in  primarily as a result of higher market demand 
operating expenses operating expenses in were million  down million  or  compared to the same period in the decrease in operating expenses in was primarily the result of lower sales volume  partially offset by lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million in the period of which million related to us inventory and million related to endako mine inventory compared to lower of cost or market product inventory write downs in the period of million of which million related to us inventory and million related to endako mine inventory  respectively 
the tc mine inventory write downs in the and periods was the result of planned mine pit sequencing from phase to phase  which resulted in significantly higher waste removal costs and lower grade ore in the last half of and first nine months of  which  in turn  reduced production and increased cash costs per pound produced at 
table of contents the tc mine 
the endako mine inventory write down in the period was primarily due to higher unit cash costs caused by lower production as a result of lower than anticipated ore grades and mill recoveries of molybdenum 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our mines increased in to per pound from per pound in  driven by increased cash costs at both the endako mine and the tc mine 
cash cost per pound produced at the endako mine in increased as a result of lower than planned production due to lower ore grade and mill recovery rates  as discussed previously 
the exchange rate averaged us c for compared to an average rate of us c in for  the tc mine cash costs included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  in at the tc mine  cash cost per pound produced in increased due to the planned mine pit sequencing  lower ore grades and the necessary removal of overburden waste during the last half of and the first nine months of  partially offset by the absence of waste stripping costs in the fourth quarter of see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
operating expenses in were million  up million  or  compared to the same period in the increase in operating expenses in was primarily the result of the waste stripping activities at our tc mine  higher sales volume  an increase in higher cost third party molybdenum that was purchased  processed  and sold  and lower of cost or market product inventory write downs of million for both mines 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our mines increased in to per pound from per pound in the increase in the cash cost per pound produced was due to lower production and higher costs at the tc mine in the second half of associated with the planned mine pit sequencing that resulted in increased waste stripping activities  lower grade ore and lower mill recovery rates  which were substantially offset by record production and higher ore grades and mill recovery rates at tc mine in the first half of the cash costs in included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced in in addition  cash cost per pound produced at the endako mine was higher in primarily as a result of higher repairs and maintenance costs to crushing and conveying systems and milling equipment 
operating expenses at the endako mine were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates converting c costs to us 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c in compared to an average rate of us c in see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to lower molybdenum pounds sold from our mines 
during  there was million of accelerated depreciation for the old mill at the endako mine  which was depreciated down to salvage value as of the first quarter of on a per pound sold basis  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in compared to as a result of higher depreciation on the new mill at the endako mine  which was completed in the first quarter of included in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is million in lower of cost or market product inventory write downs  of which million related to us inventory and million related to endako mine inventory

asset impairments given the significant decline in molybdenum prices during and the performance of our two mines  we closely monitored and evaluated potential write downs throughout the year 
during the third quarter of  we suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at tc mine 
this decision and the decline in molybdenum prices represented significant changes in our business  requiring us to evaluate for potential impairments on an enterprise wide basis at september  for purposes of the impairment evaluation  management considered estimates of after tax discounted future cash flows of the individual reporting units  life of mine plans developed using long term analyst pricing reflective of the then current price environment  management projections for operating costs and the market value of our equity 
as a result of this evaluation  an impairment charge of million  representing the remaining balance of goodwill  was recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  both management view of future molybdenum prices and the long term analyst view of molybdenum prices were adjusted further downward 
in addition  due to certain operational issues at endako mine  as discussed in overview  we revised our operating plan for endako for  and these revisions impacted the endako life of mine plan 
combined  these events constituted a triggering event  requiring us to evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
in accordance with us gaap  potential long lived asset impairments are assessed pursuant to a two step approach 
in evaluating potential long lived asset impairments  the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value computed using undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the assets being tested is greater than the undiscounted cash flows from that asset  then step two requires that we evaluate those assets for impairment 
the amount of the impairment is recorded based on the difference between the book value and the estimated fair value of the asset computed using discounted estimated future cash flows 
while the endako mine assets were evaluated during third quarter  no impairment loss on the endako assets was taken during the third quarter as the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets exceeded their carrying values step 
after the fourth quarter triggering event  this evaluation indicated that the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets step were less than their carrying values 
as a result  we were required  under us gaap  to measure the impairment loss step by comparing the carrying values of the endako mine assets to their discounted estimated future cash flows 
this evaluation resulted in a pre tax non cash write down of our share of the endako property  plant  equipment and development assets of million in the fourth quarter of our impairment analysis did not result in any other long lived asset impairments as of december  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be further asset write downs if we continue to experience operational challenges and or if commodity prices further decline 
there were no asset or goodwill impairment charges in or interest and finance fees interest and finance fees of million in were composed of approximately million of commitment fees incurred on the unused revolving credit facility prior to its termination  million of debt issuance cost amortization which included million due to the expensing of previously capitalized deferred financing fees for the termination of our revolving credit facility  and million of interest on the mobile mining equipment loans

the remaining foreign exchange loss was the result of c cash balances that have the us as their measurement currency and on us payables and receivables that have the c as their measurement currency 
for  the foreign exchange gain was primarily the result of a million foreign exchange gain from the settlement of an intercompany note from canadian operations related to the terrane acquisition 
in addition  a gain of million on foreign exchange derivative instruments was recognized in the foreign exchange rate was us c at december  compared to us c at december  and us c at december  income and mining tax benefit expense income and mining tax benefit was million in compared to income and mining tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the tax benefit for the twelve months ended december  was primarily impacted by the asset impairment which resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of million through a reduction of our associated deferred tax liabilities 
however  we also recognized a valuation allowance  in part  as a result of the asset impairment  which reduced our net tax benefit on the endako mine deferred tax assets by million 
prior to  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance related to the endako mine  we considered the reversal of our taxable temporary differences as a source of taxable income in order to fully realize all of the related benefits associated with the endako mine deferred tax assets 
with the asset impairment charge in  the associated taxable temporary differences were reduced 
as a result  we concluded in the fourth quarter of that a portion of our deferred tax assets related to the endako mine will not be realized due to a lack of reversing taxable temporary differences 
in addition  the net tax benefit for the twelve months ended december  was also impacted by the goodwill impairment  which did not generate any income tax benefit  the us percentage depletion benefit  and an immaterial correction of million related to the british columbia mineral tax associated with our share of the expansion costs at the endako mine from the quarter ended december  the tax expense for the twelve months ended december  was impacted by the non cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants  which did not generate any income tax expense  and the us percentage depletion benefit 
the tax expense for benefited from a net refund of million of certain state income taxes related to state tax planning  a realization of alternative minimum tax credits which resulted in a million reduction of the related valuation allowance due to a tax election related to the treatment of development costs and an out of period adjustment of million due to a difference between the income tax provision and the tax return  whereby we realized an additional net operating loss carry back

molybdenum production and cash costs in an effort to reduce costs at the tc mine  given recent declines in molybdenum prices and projected operating costs at tc mine for and thereafter  in october  we suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at the tc mine  referred to as phase we expect this revision to the mine plan to defer approximately million in operating costs and million in capital expenditures through year end mining operations and production are expected to continue as planned through in the current phase of the mine 
we also expect to preserve the assets at tc mine to enable us to restart waste stripping of phase of the mine plan when market conditions warrant 
if waste stripping has not recommenced by  we expect that the mine would be placed on care and maintenance at such time 
if management commits to a plan to put the mine on care and maintenance  depreciation expense and asset values will be adjusted in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
molybdenum production from the tc mine was million pounds in the fourth quarter of  up from million pounds produced in the fourth quarter of production for the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted by the planned mine pit sequencing  transitioning into phase of the mine plan in the second half of  which included waste stripping activities and mining significantly lower grade ore and  consequently  lower mill throughput 
during the third quarter of  tc mine began accessing the higher grade ore from phase  which resulted in higher production  and higher mill recovery  compared to the fourth quarter of for  molybdenum production from the tc mine was million pounds  down from million pounds produced during during the first half of  due to the planned mine pit sequencing  tc mine was mining high grade ore primarily in the bottom of the pit 
beginning in the third quarter of  tc mine transitioned from the bottom of the pit to the top of the pit  commencing waste stripping activities and mining lower grade ore from phase of the mine plan 
as a result  for the full year of compared to the full year of  production was lower primarily due to the significantly lower ore grade 
additionally  production in the second and third quarter of was negatively impacted by a pit wall slough in may  which was more than offset by the mining of higher grade ore from phase in the fourth quarter of partly offsetting lower production in  the mill recovery rate improved in versus mainly due to the absence of oxidized 
table of contents ore that was processed in which lowered recovery in  and continuous improvement initiatives implemented by the mill staff in the tc mine had record molybdenum production in and the first half of due to the planned mine pit sequencing and the mining of high grade ore primarily in the bottom of the pit during these periods 
in  the tc mine produced million pounds  down approximately from a record million pounds produced during the overall lower production for was primarily the result of significantly lower production in the second half of due to the lower grade ore and a lower mill recovery rate associated with the planned mine pit sequencing  which somewhat offset record production in the first half of the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced of per pound in the fourth quarter of was significantly lower than per pound in the fourth quarter of see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
the cash costs for the fourth quarter of were lower due to higher production and lower stripping costs as a result of the mine plan changes in discussed above 
the cash costs in the fourth quarter of included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  in the fourth quarter of the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced in increased to per pound compared to per pound in the cash costs in included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  in the increase in cash cost in primarily resulted from the impact of significantly lower ore grade and production as a result of the continued transitioning into phase of the mine plan in compared to the higher grade ore mined in the first half of  prior to such transition as discussed above 
additionally  during  tc mine incurred costs associated with a new access road to work around the pit wall slough 
lower stripping costs in compared to resulted from a higher volume of waste material moved in related to phase  as discussed previously 
see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
the cash cost per pound produced in increased to per pound compared to per pound in primarily due to lower production and higher costs in the second half of associated with the planned mine pit sequencing  increased waste stripping activities and the lower grade ore and mill recovery rates  which was partially offset by record production and higher ore grades and mill recovery rates at the tc mine in the first half of the cash costs in included stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  compared to stripping costs of million  or per pound produced  in see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced 
molybdenum sold molybdenum pounds sold from the tc mine in the fourth quarter of was million pounds  which was down from million pounds sold in the fourth quarter of lower sales volumes in were mainly the result of lower production in the first half of due to planned stripping activities at the tc mine 
as a result of such anticipated lower production in the first half of  we entered into annual sales contracts for lower volumes of product  as compared to  and supplemented production in the first half of with purchased product 
also contributing to lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter of was a weaker spot market in the second half of compared to the same period in  which in turn led to a build up of inventory in the second half of the average realized sales price in the fourth quarter of was per pound  which was down approximately from the fourth quarter of average realized sales price of per pound 
during the fourth quarter of  sales included deliveries against certain forward sales contracts related to phase production at tc mine of approximately million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound 
no similar deliveries under these contracts occurred in as all sales under these agreements were completed in for  tc mine sold million pounds of molybdenum at an average realized sales price of per pound  compared to million pounds sold at an average realized sales price of per pound in lower sales volumes in were mainly the result of lower production in the first half of due to planned stripping activities at the tc mine for the reasons stated above

the endako mine cash cost represents the mining including all stripping costs  milling  mine site administration  roasting and packaging for molybdenum oxide produced in the period 
cash cost excludes the effect of purchase price adjustments  the effects of changes in inventory  corporate allocations  stock based compensation  other non cash employee benefits  depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion  and commissioning and start up costs for the endako mill 
see non gaap financial measures for additional information 
in march  we completed the mill expansion at the endako mine  with our share of the aggregate capital expenditures totaling approximately c million including c million of our share of start up and commissioning costs that were included in operating expenses 
the endako mill expansion project included the construction of a new mill to replace the previous mill constructed in the s 
the new mill is designed to process  tons of ore per day compared to  tons per day in the old mill 
commissioning of the new sag ball mill and rougher flotation circuit was completed in early january  followed by the completion of the remaining construction work on the regrind circuit and the pebble crusher in late march 
the old mill at the site has been shut down and is currently in a care and maintenance mode 
as a cost saving initiative  as previously reported  we ceased mining ore from the denak west mine pit at the endako mine in the third quarter of and began processing stockpiled ore 
we expect to mill approximately one third of our existing stockpiled material through mid we are planning to resume mining at the endako mine during the third quarter 
during the year ended december   our share of capital expenditures for the mill expansion project was million 
molybdenum production and cash costs our share of molybdenum production at the endako mine in the fourth quarter of of million pounds remained constant compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of the start up of the new mill at endako in the first quarter of  together with a lower than expected recovery rate from the new mill and lower ore grade from milling stockpiled ore  production in has been lower than anticipated 
for  our share of molybdenum production at the endako mine decreased approximately to million pounds compared to million pounds in this decrease was primarily due to lower than anticipated mined ore grade in the first eight months of from the denak west pit  a lower than expected recovery rate from the new mill and lower ore grade from stockpiled ore processed in the last five months of  which were partly offset by higher mill throughput in for  our share of molybdenum production at the endako mine decreased to million pounds compared to million pounds in this decrease was primarily due to lower ore grade and a lower mill recovery rate in compared to  partly offset by higher tons mined and milled 
the non gaap financial measure of cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound in the fourth quarter of from per pound in the fourth quarter of see non gaap financial measures below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced 
the cash costs for the endako mine were impacted by lower production and higher costs from the new mill 
costs at the endako mine were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
the exchange rate averaged us c for the fourth quarter of compared to an average rate of us c in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents for  the cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound compared to per pound in the increase in cash cost per pound produced in was primarily the result of the impact on unit costs from lower production  and higher costs in the new mill as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs in the roaster 
the increased cash cost per pound was offset by favorable foreign exchange rates 
the exchange rate averaged us c for compared to an average rate of us c for for  a change in the canadian foreign exchange rate results in a change in the cash cost per pound produced of approximately per pound 
for  the cash cost per pound produced increased to per pound compared to per pound in the increase in cash cost per pound produced in was primarily the result of higher repairs and maintenance costs to crushing and conveying systems  which also resulted in higher ore haulage costs and mill equipment repairs 
additionally  cold and wet weather conditions caused higher than expected downtime in the first half of due to material getting caught in chutes and plugging up screening systems 
costs were also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates converting c costs to us costs 
the foreign exchange rate averaged us c in compared to an average rate of us c in molybdenum sold our share of molybdenum sold from the endako mine in the fourth quarter of was million pounds  which was up from million pounds sold in the fourth quarter of the average realized sales price in the fourth quarter of was per pound  which was down from the fourth quarter of average realized sales price of per pound 
the increase in sales volume in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of was primarily due to timing of customer deliveries at the end of  which caused a corresponding increase in ending inventory at year end the decline in the average realized sales price in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of was the result of declining market prices for molybdenum 
for  our share of molybdenum sold from the endako mine was million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound compared to million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound in for  our share of molybdenum sold from the endako mine was million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound compared to million pounds at an average realized sales price of per pound in fixed asset impairment given the significant decline in molybdenum prices during and the performance of our two mines  we closely monitored and evaluated potential write downs throughout the year 
during the fourth quarter of  both management view of future molybdenum prices and the long term analyst view of molybdenum prices were adjusted downward 
in addition  due to certain operational issues at endako mine  as discussed further below  we revised our operating plan for endako for  and these revisions impacted the endako life of mine plan 
combined  these events constituted a triggering event  requiring us to evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
in accordance with us gaap  potential long lived asset impairments are assessed pursuant to a two step approach 
in evaluating potential long lived asset impairments  the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value computed using undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the assets being tested is greater than the undiscounted cash flows from that asset  then step two requires that we evaluate those assets for impairment 
the amount of the impairment is recorded based on the difference between the book value and the estimated fair value of the asset computed using discounted estimated future cash flows 
while the endako mine assets were evaluated during third quarter in conjunction with the impairment of goodwill  as discussed previously  no impairment loss on the endako assets was taken during the third quarter as the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets exceeded their carrying values step 
after the fourth quarter triggering event  this evaluation indicated that the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets step were less than their carrying values 
as a result  we were required  under us gaap  to measure the impairment loss step by comparing the carrying values of the endako mine assets to their discounted estimated future cash flows 
this evaluation resulted in a pre tax non cash write down of our share of the endako property  plant  equipment and development assets of million in the fourth quarter of our remaining share of the property  plant and development assets was million as of december   which represents our share of the fair values of the endako mine assets 
our impairment analysis did not result in any other long lived asset impairments as of december  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be further asset write downs if we continue to experience operational challenges and or if commodity prices further decline 
at the endako mine  we experienced lower than anticipated ore grades and recovery during in addition  in late december and thus far in  we experienced and are experiencing tailings management issues associated with frozen water in the tailings pond 
we have been unable to feed sufficient water from the tailings pond to the new mill on a consistent basis  which has negatively impacted the rate and level of throughput of mined material to the mill and thus our production of 
table of contents molybdenum 
these issues led us to revise our operating plan for the endako mine for as of the date of this report  we have made modifications to the piping of tailings to the pond and have instituted other tailings management procedures to address these issues to ensure the availability of a sufficient supply of water to the mill for the future winter seasons beyond copper gold development mt 
milligan project during the fourth quarter and year ended december   we made cash and financing capital expenditures of c million and c million  respectively  for the mt 
milligan project 
capitalized interest and debt issuance costs were c million and c million  for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended december   respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily related to the ongoing construction of the tailings storage facility  buildings and facilities concentrator  truck shop  administration building  and primary and pebble crushers  plant site earthworks  cement works  steel erection  construction camp costs  mine development  mining equipment and engineering design costs 
we have incurred c  million in cash spend since the inception of the project through december  we entered into two concentrate sales agreements on june  and one concentrate sales agreement on august   whereby we agreed  among other things  to sell to three separate customers an aggregate of approximately of the copper gold silver concentrate produced at mt 
milligan during and and an aggregate of approximately  dry metric tons in each of the two calendar years thereafter 
under one of the agreements  we have the option to sell to the counterparty  and the counterparty has the obligation to purchase from us  up to  dry metric tons of additional concentrate per year during each of and under each of these agreements  payment for the concentrate will be based on the agreed copper  gold and silver content of the parcels delivered less smelting and refining charges and certain other deductions  if applicable 
in august  we entered into an agreement for terminal facilities and services at a port in vancouver  british columbia for storage and loading of concentrate from mt 
milligan 
in connection therewith  we were required to deposit c million cash  in c million increments  with the terminal services provider for costs required to upgrade the facilities to be utilized by us 
we paid deposits of c million in the remaining c million deposit was paid on january  this c million deposit will be returned to us upon the earlier of first shipment of concentrate from mt

milligan until the earlier of the date upon which  ounces of refined gold have been sold and delivered to royal gold or the date upon which the aggregate dollar amount of the difference between the market price for the gold delivered to royal gold and the price actually paid by royal gold pursuant to the terms of our agreement exceeds million 
shortly after execution of the august amendment  royal gold made a cash payment to us of million 
additionally  payments of million and million were made on september  and december   respectively 
the gold stream arrangement provides for future scheduled payments by royal gold to us in an aggregate amount of million  to be paid on a quarterly basis as follows million on march   million on june   and million on september  we must maintain a deposit record during the term of the gold stream arrangement wherein we reduce the million total amount paid by royal gold by the difference between the current market price at the time of sale of refined gold to royal gold and per ounce  multiplied by the amount of refined gold sold in such sale 
if  at the end of the initial year term of the agreement  the total deposit amount reflected in the deposit record has not been reduced to nil  we must pay to royal gold the remaining balance reflected in the deposit record 
royal gold has a security interest in all of the mt 
milligan assets until its total deposit amount has been reduced to nil 
royal gold security interest is subject to subordination to project or corporate financings by us  except that in such circumstances  royal gold retains a first priority interest in of the refined gold from mt 
milligan 
after the total deposit amount has been reduced to nil  royal gold security will consist solely of its first priority interest in of the refined gold 
the cash payments received under the gold stream arrangement are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as a long term liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
once mt 
milligan is in production and begins delivering gold to royal gold  the liability will be amortized over the life of the mine based on the amount of gold delivered

non gaap financial measures 
table of contents in addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap  we use certain non gaap financial measures of our financial performance for the reasons described further below 
the presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from  as a substitute for  or as superior to  the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap  and the presentation of these measures may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
in addition  these non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted net loss income  adjusted net loss income per share basic and diluted adjusted net loss income  and adjusted net loss income per share basic and diluted  are referred to in this md a 
these are considered key measures by our management in evaluating our operating performance on a quarterly and annual basis 
management uses this measure in evaluating our performance as it represents a profitability measure that is not impacted by changes in the market price of our previously outstanding warrants or significant non cash items  such as asset impairments  that are considered non recurring in nature 
these measures do not have standard meanings prescribed by us gaap and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
we believe that these non gaap measures provide useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate our performance using the same measures as those used by management and  as a result  the investor is afforded greater transparency in assessing our financial performance 
adjusted net loss income represents the net loss income prepared in accordance with us gaap  adjusted for significant non cash items 
for the periods  the significant non cash items were the non cash losses related to the impairment of assets at endako mine  net of income tax effects  goodwill impairment and the non cash gains and losses on the fair value adjustment related to the common stock purchase warrants that were outstanding until june  for the and periods  the significant non cash items were the non cash gains and losses on the fair value adjustment related to the then outstanding common stock purchase warrants 
as a result of significant deterioration in the projected price of molybdenum  lower than anticipated ore grades and recovery at the endako mine and tailings management issues at the endako mine  together with a change in the endako operating plan for  management reviewed the carrying value of assets at endako mine 
this review  which is discussed further in overview  resulted in a pre tax asset impairment of million to the assets at the endako mine  representing a write down to the assets estimated fair values 
this impairment was included in total costs and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
in addition  during  tcm suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at tc mine 
this decision  coupled with declines in molybdenum prices  represented significant changes in our business requiring us to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis during as a result of this evaluation  a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the remaining balance of goodwill  was recorded as other expense and income in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income in we follow the guidance issued by the emerging issues task force eitf that common stock purchase warrants with a strike price denominated in a currency other than the entity reporting currency are not considered linked to equity  and therefore  are to be accounted for as derivatives 
as a result  our outstanding common stock purchase warrants are accounted for as derivatives 
we recorded a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption and subsequent changes to the fair value of the terrane warrants  as discussed below  are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income at each quarter end 
in connection with our acquisition of terrane  we agreed to pay holders of warrants issued by terrane the terrane warrants certain share and cash consideration 
a cash payment was not required by us at settlement  therefore  management does not consider gains or losses on these warrants in its evaluation of our financial performance 
the last of these warrants expired in june during the second quarter of  approximately million warrants were exercised 
in connection with this exercise  approximately  shares of common stock were issued and million was paid in cash 
adjusted net loss income per share basic and diluted is calculated using adjusted earnings  as defined above  divided by the weighted average basic and weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the period as determined in accordance with us gaap

critical accounting estimates in preparing financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
critical accounting assumptions affect the consolidated financial statements materially and require a significant level of judgment by management 
there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions and estimates 
asset impairments we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  using a fair value based approach when events and circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 
the economic environment  molybdenum prices and our stock price may be considered as impairment indicators for the purposes of these impairment assessments 
in accordance with us gaap  the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income based on the difference between book value and the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group computed using discounted estimated future cash flows  or the application of an expected present value technique in the absence of a market price 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable quantities to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves  molybdenum prices considering current and historical prices  price trends and related factors  
table of contents production quantities and capital expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
generally  in estimating future cash flows  all assets are grouped at a particular mine for which there are identifiable cash flows 
during  at the endako mine  we experienced lower than anticipated ore grades and recovery 
in addition  during  the sales price of molybdenum deteriorated significantly and  at year end  projections for future molybdenum pricing were further revised downward 
also  in late december and thus far in  we experienced and are experiencing water management issues associated with frozen water in the tailings pond 
we have been unable to feed sufficient water from the tailings pond to the new mill on a consistent basis  which has negatively impacted the rate and level of throughput of mined material to the mill and thus our production of molybdenum 
these issues led management to revise its operating plan for the endako mine for during the fourth quarter of this revised plan  when combined with recent declines in molybdenum prices  caused a triggering event  leading management to reassess its impairment evaluation that was performed during the fourth quarter of no impairment loss on the endako assets was taken during the third quarter as the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets exceeded their carrying values 
the impairment evaluation we performed during the fourth quarter of  however  indicated that the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the endako mine assets were less than their carrying values 
as a result  we were required  under us gaap  to measure the impairment loss by comparing the carrying values of the endako mine assets to their discounted estimated cash flows 
this evaluation resulted in a pre tax non cash write down of our share of the endako property  plant  equipment and development assets of million to the assets at endako mine  representing a write down to the assets fair values 
our impairment evaluation of long lived assets for and did not result in any impairment identification 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
goodwill is assessed for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value computed using discounted estimated future cash flows from the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the assets being tested is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  then step two requires that we evaluate those assets for impairment on an enterprise wide basis 
during  we suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at tc mine 
this decision  coupled with declines in molybdenum prices  represented significant changes in our business  requiring us to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis 
for purposes of the impairment evaluation  estimates of after tax discounted future cash flows of the individual reporting units were used 
the estimated cash flows were derived from life of mine plans developed using long term analyst pricing reflective of the then current price environment and management projections for operating costs 
we also considered the market value of our equity 
as a result of this evaluation  an impairment charge of million  representing the remaining balance of goodwill  was recorded for the year ended december  no goodwill impairment charge was recognized during the year ended december  mineral reserves and depreciation  depletion and amortization property  plant  equipment and development are recorded at cost 
expenditures for property  plant  equipment and development relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized if they extend useful lives or extend functionality 
fixed plant and machinery are amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on contained pounds to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves 
facilities  mobile and other equipment are depreciated on either a declining balance basis or a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the life of the mine 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred  except when these repairs extend the life or functionality of the asset 
in these instances  that portion of the expenditure is capitalized and amortized over the period benefited 
the estimate that most significantly affects the units of production rate is the quantity of proven and probable molybdenum mineral reserves 
the estimation of mineral reserves is complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include the use of geological modeling and sampling as well as estimates of long term molybdenum prices and future mining costs 
these estimates and assumptions can change as a result of numerous factors  including new information gained from development activities  evolving production history and a reassessment of the viability of production under different economic conditions 
significant judgment is involved in the reserve estimates  and actual results may differ significantly from current assumptions 
asset retirement obligations accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates of the future costs we will incur to complete the work required to comply with existing laws and regulations at each mining operation 
actual costs may differ from the amounts estimated 
also  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from molybdenum sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  the product has been delivered  title has transferred  and collection is reasonably assured 
our sales contracts specify the point in the delivery process at which title transfers to the customer shipping point or destination 
shipping and handling fees are accounted for on a gross basis under the terms of the contract 
we recognize tolling and calcining revenue under contractual arrangements as the services are performed on a per unit basis 
we enter into provisionally priced sales contracts  whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined at a future date based upon quoted prices 
the future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative  which is bifurcated and separately marked to an estimated fair value at the end of each period 
changes to the fair value of embedded derivatives related to molybdenum sales agreements are included in molybdenum sales revenue in the determination of net loss income 
to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to molybdenum sales is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
accordingly  in times of rising molybdenum prices  molybdenum sales benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior years  in times of falling molybdenum prices  the opposite occurs 
income and mining taxes in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates and laws is recognized in net loss income in the period in which such changes are enacted 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income  reversal of taxable temporary differences  carry backs  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we make a determination that we ultimately will be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
at december   tax valuation allowances total million 
of this amount  million relates to allowances covering our foreign tax credit and alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards in the us  million relates to allowances covering some of the capital and non capital tax loss carry forwards in both the us and canada and million relates to allowances covering some of our capital expenditures  primarily at the endako mine 
the determination of our tax expense for the year and its future tax assets and liabilities involves significant management estimation and judgment involving a number of assumptions 
in determining these amounts  management interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes estimates of the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities 
we also make estimates of future earnings which affect cross border tax rate assumptions  tax planning strategies and the extent to which potential future tax benefits may be used 
we are subject to assessments by various taxation authorities which may interpret tax legislation differently 
these differences may affect the final amount or the timing of the payment of taxes 
we provide for such differences where known based on management best estimate of the probable outcome of these matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk molybdenum our consolidated molybdenum sales represent the sale of molybdenum in various forms from our mines and from third party material that is purchased  processed and sold 
molybdenum sales for december  were million  with cash used by operations of million 
for each per pound change in molybdenum prices using the molybdenum pounds sold from our mines in  our revenue would change by approximately million 
we enter into provisionally priced sales contracts  whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined at a future date 
the future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative  which is bifurcated and separately 
table of contents marked to estimated fair value at the end of each period 
changes to the fair value of embedded derivatives related to molybdenum sales contracts are included in molybdenum sales revenue in the determination of net loss income 
to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to molybdenum sales is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
accordingly  in times of rising molybdenum prices  molybdenum sales benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior years  in times of falling molybdenum prices  the opposite occurs 
the following table sets forth our outstanding provisionally priced contracts as of december   which all mature in pounds to be sold purchased s lb provisionally priced sales provisionally priced purchases we also enter into certain molybdenum sales contracts to sell future molybdenum production at fixed prices 
these fixed prices may be different than the quoted market price at the date of sale 
the following table sets forth our outstanding fixed price molybdenum sales contracts as of december  december  molybdenum committed s lb average price lb historically  these contracts were recorded as derivatives with changes in the fair value recorded to net loss income 
beginning october   we elected to treat these contracts as normal purchase and normal sales contracts 
as such  these contracts are no longer recorded at market value mark to market at each reporting period 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded losses of nil  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
in the normal course of operations  we enter into agreements for the purchase of molybdenum 
as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million pounds of molybdenum sulfide concentrate from to  to be priced at a discount to the market price for molybdenum oxide at the time of purchase 
copper and gold we are currently in the process of constructing and developing our mt 
milligan project which will be an open pit copper and gold mine and concentrator 
mt 
milligan is designed to be a conventional truck shovel open pit mine with a  ton per day copper flotation processing plant with estimated average annual production over the life of the mine of million pounds of copper and  ounces of gold  each in concentrate 
once mt 
milligan is operational and we begin to sell concentrate from this mine  we will be exposed to fluctuations in the market price of gold and copper  each of which is affected by factors beyond our control 
the extent to which these price fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial condition will be determined by the volume of concentrate we sell from this mine 
during the years ended december   and  we did not have exposure to fluctuations in the price of gold or copper 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various currencies in the normal course of our operations 
all of our revenues are denominated in the us dollar  however  we pay certain expenses attributable to our canadian operations in the canadian dollar 
as a result  we have ongoing foreign exchange translation risk with respect to our canadian operations 
a decrease of in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would have decreased operating loss income during the year ended december  by approximately million 
to help mitigate this risk  from time to time  we enter into various derivative instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts  options and collars 
the terms of these instruments are typically less than one year 
as of december   we had no open foreign currency contracts 
as of december   we had open foreign currency option contracts for c million at exchange rates ranging from to and million at an exchange rate of
