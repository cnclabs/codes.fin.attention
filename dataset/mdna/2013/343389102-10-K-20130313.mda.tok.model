executive summary flotek industries  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries flotek  the company  we  us  or the possessives of such terms develop and supply oilfield products  services and equipment for use in the oil  gas and mining industries 
the company strategic focus includes specialty chemicals and logistics  downhole drilling and production tools  and automated bulk material handling  loading and blending 
the company products and services help customers to more efficiently drill wells  increase production in existing wells  and decrease well operating costs 
the company operates in both domestic and international markets  including the gulf coast  southwest  rocky mountain  northeastern and mid continental regions of the united states us as well as canada  mexico  central america  south america  europe  africa and asia 
through operations and agency relationships the company markets products and services in over countries worldwide 
customers include major integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies  pressure pumping service companies  contract drilling providers  national and state owned oil companies and international supply chain management companies 
the company business is comprised of three reportable segments 
while each segment technical expertise is unique  all segments are committed to provide customers with quality  competitively priced products and services 
a detailed description of each segment business operations and services is as follows specialty chemicals chemicals designs  develops  manufactures  packages and markets specialty chemicals used in oil and natural gas well cementing  stimulation  acidizing  drilling and production activities 
the chemicals segment also contains our logistics division  which manages automated bulk material handling  loading facilities  and blending services for oilfield services companies 
drilling products drilling manufactures  rents  inspects  and markets downhole drilling equipment required for use in energy  mining  water well and industrial drilling activities 
artificial lift assembles and markets artificial lift equipment  notably our petrovalve product line of rod pump components  electric submersible pumps  gas separators  valves  and services that support coal bed methane cbm drilling activities 
the company s results of operations are heavily dependent upon the sustainability of prices charged to customers  which is significantly impacted by drilling activity levels  availability of equipment and other resources and competitive pricing pressures 
customers exploration and production budgets  in many instances  depend upon the revenue generated from the sale of oil and natural gas 
lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets 
the opposite is true for higher oil and natural gas prices 
the company s ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent upon the ability to differentiate and provide superior products and services while maintaining a competitive cost structure 
domestic operations are reactive to fluctuations in natural gas and oil well drilling activity  well depth and drilling conditions  number of well completions and level of workover activity in north america 
north american drilling activity is aligned with and responsive to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil commodity prices as well as market expectations of future prices

rig counts are the annual average of the reported weekly rig count activity 
oil and gas prices are the annual average of the monthly average natural gas price 
during the annual period  north american drilling activity remained consistent with annual levels as reflected in the table above 
additionally  the period continued drilling patterns and commodity shifts similar of the annual period of increased average north american active drilling  further shifts in horizontal drilling and preferred growth in crude oil activity  predominantly from tight formations in onshore basins such as the williston and permian basins in the us and also the oil sands formations in canada 
also  the increased usage of horizontal drilling and multi stage hydraulic fracturing has increased the economic viability of tight oil production in north america  and the increased complexity of recovering oil and natural gas from these types of formations 
as spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production e p companies is heavily influenced by expectations of future supply and forecast demand for oil and natural gas products  as well as forecast costs to find  develop and produce reserves  the continued shift in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending sustained record demand for the company s products and services in r and  as compared to as the company continuously strives to maintain a dynamic focus on customers demands for products and services  strategically the company has aligned itself with oil drilling activity  but  remains vigilantly watchful for further shifts in market and customer demands 
as reflected above  during the annual period  crude oil prices remained high as a result of geopolitical tensions in the middle east  uncertainty about the european economy  and questions about the length and sustainability of the economic recovery in the us  resulting in continued volatility and demand for oil commodity products 
west texas intermediate spot prices spent most of the first and second quarters of above per barrel  but fell to a low of less than per barrel in early july 
the remainder of saw crude oil prices partially recovered  but not exceeding per barrel through the remainder of the year 
the average north american oil directed rig count increased by rigs  or  during compared to  driven by increased horizontal drilling activity in tight formations  partially offset by declines in conventional vertical drilling 
north american drilling rig count generally increased throughout the year in  but generally decreased throughout  with the fourth quarter of exhibiting the lowest drilling rig count for the year 
this continued shift from natural gas to oil and liquids rich shale basins continues to support an increase in the company product and service demands as well as support the continued demand for the company patented cnf chemistry and other technological reliance designed to promote efficiency within complex reservoirs 
as this trend continued throughout  horizontal oil directed drilling activity was the fastest growing segment of the market 
given the current alignment of the company products and operations  this activity generally increases the demand for the company products and services 
during the annual period  these trends continued to provide for demand across certain of the company s products lines and services offerings 
increased economic activity  particularly within north american markets  combined with emerging middle eastern and asian market predictions for continued economic growth  support a continued demand for oil products 

table of contents natural gas prices continued their decline during the annual period  with average spot prices for henry hub declining during  reaching a low of less than mmbtu during the second quarter of the annual period 
excluding alaska and hawaii  the natural gas working inventories of the lower states averaged tcf during  compared to tcf during  due to increased natural gas production from north american shale formations and warmer than average winter temperatures during the increase in working inventories and decline in natural gas prices was reflected in the decline in overall north american gas directed drilling activity  with a decrease in the average number of working rigs of rigs  or  during compared to despite the continued shift from natural gas to liquids rich natural gas and oil drilling during  spending on natural gas directed projects is supported by hedges on prior period production transacted when futures prices were higher  the need to drill and produce natural gas wells to hold leases acquired in earlier periods  the influx of equity from companies interested in penetration and development of shale resource plays  and associated production of natural gas liquids in certain basins 
e p companies continue to strive to improve discovery and production techniques to the point that  despite current relatively depressed natural gas prices  drilling for natural gas continues to be economically viable for the company customers 
notwithstanding the continued shift in drilling activity and ever present geopolitical uncertainties  the company believes over the long term  any major macroeconomic disruptions will ultimately correct themselves as the underlying trends of significant demand growth within developing countries  smaller and more complex reservoir activity  high depletion rates  and the need for continual reserve replacement support the company s on going strategic expansion initiatives with patented cnf chemistries along with initiatives to increase domestic and international market penetration 
outlook for the company anticipates current economic conditions will continue through under current market conditions and trends 
the company  however  remains cognizant that if further unfavorable economic conditions occur  the company could be unfavorably impacted by additional drilling activity uncertainty 
going forward the company believes sustained current activity will ensure margin sustainability  but anticipates that growing cost pressures could stall forecast margin improvements in despite the continued pressure on natural gas prices and continued volatility in crude oil prices  the company believes the current outlook for our industry is cautiously favorable 
the near term outlook for oil and gas prices as published by the us energy information administration eia anticipates that average crude oil prices will remain largely comparable to price levels and average prices for natural gas will improve due to closer to average winter temperatures in as well as the continued shift to higher levels of usage of natural gas for power generation in the us additionally  the eia anticipates north american drilling activity will increase in relative to  with the majority of the increase coming from tight  unconventional oil formations 
the company believes such market conditions would favorably impact the demand for the company products and services and provide an increased potential of the exploitation of these types of reservoirs 
as future recovery of oil and gas reserves continues to shift to more complex reservoirs  the company believes products and services offered will continue to be in demand 
in addition  the company believes growing recognition and demand for lower environmental impact and products which increase oil and gas recovery efficiencies will make the company environmentally friendly green stimulation fluid additives and eor products more attractive to existing and new customers 
accordingly  the company remains committed to a robust research and development r d program in order to remain responsive to the needs of our customers 
during the company spent million on r d activities  up from million in  and anticipates expenditures will be similar to capital expenditures for totaled million  up from million in increased capital expenditures during consisted primarily of rental tools  equipment  facilities to meet customer demand and our new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the company expects capital expenditures  excluding possible acquisitions  to remain consistent compared to levels with increased expenditures within the chemicals and drilling segments 
capital expenditures in the specialty chemicals business totaled million in compared to million in  or and  respectively as a percentage of revenue 
capital expenditures in the drilling business totaled million in compared to million in  or and  respectively as a percentage of revenue 
the company expects the annual chemicals and drilling capital expenditures to be million and million  respectively  but could fluctuate in response to changes in market demand  realized results of operations  and strategic initiatives taken by the company should certain expansion opportunities arise 
given the completion of the implementation of the erp system in as well as the new corporate office build out  corporate capital expenditures are expected to decrease in as compared to levels in

a key driver in the increase of sales has been an increase in customer demand resulting for the company oil tools resulting from the continued shift away from gas directed drilling in north america to oil directed drilling 
in reaction to the continued shift in drilling activity and oil prices  customer product demands increased for company products adapted for the current oil directed drilling activity and environments 
additionally  increased product demand and resulting increased sales can be attributed within the chemicals segment due to the company adaptation of cnf products which serve as effective oil mobility enhancement contributors and within the drilling segment to the company teledrift  pro series  and prodrift tools utilized in oil and liquids based drilling activity 
as a result the company has benefited from the addition of several new strategic customers  expansion of our product offerings with existing customers  increased capacity by shifts in customer demand to higher margin products 
partially offsetting the increased sales for the annual period are decreased sales of million within the company artificial lift segment due to the decline in installs and workovers as a result of decreased customer activity impacted by the decline in natural gas prices during and the corresponding decline in natural gas directed drilling activity 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin is primarily due to a shift to a more favorable product mix during along with reductions in materials and operating costs 
as a result of the continued shift in drilling activity and type the company customers have shifted to higher margin products offered by the company 
additionally  the company has recognized cost savings as a result of negotiated raw material price concessions with existing vendors in addition to exploration of raw material sourcing alternatives  as well as efficiencies gained from new plant and equipment additions and improved manufacturing processes 
increasing industry recognition of proven production efficiencies and environmental benefits derived from use of flotek s new and existing products also increased demand in both the chemicals and drilling segments 
operating income for the annual period was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million  or for the annual period the increase in operating income is primarily due to increased margins and sales volume and product activity as noted above 
tempering the increase in operating income  as exemplified by a percentage of revenue decrease of  is the company implementation of the a new erp system and the addition of the company new corporate offices 
the company expects the benefits from the increased operational and management reporting efficiencies will more than offset the costs of the new erp system and likewise expects the benefits from its new location and facilities to provide the much needed support of the increased growth and operations by the company operating business segments

given the continued shift away from gas directed drilling in north america to oil directed drilling  the company adaptation of cnf products to serve as effective oil mobility enhancers resulted in increased sales 
oil molecules are larger and more difficult to mobilize through low permeability formation than gas molecules and thus oil reservoirs benefit even more from the use of additives such as flotek cnf products 
in general  revenue growth was the result of the company s development  strategic adaptation and customization of proprietary natural gas effective cnf additives to oil effective cnf additives for new and existing customers  increased market demand and incremental domestic and international market penetration 
increasing industry recognition of proven production efficiencies and environmental benefits derived from use of flotek s new and existing products increased demand for cnf products in both domestic and international markets 
the company experienced significant expansion in the rocky mountain regions  primarily the niobrara formation 
during the company continued to experience increased success of cnf products with the addition major new customers in oily shale basins where the company cnf products are employed 
also contributing to the support of sales expansion is the company partnerships with major service companies and the continuous support of operational efforts to educate the end users of cnf products as to the benefits of the cnf products 
additionally  the company has seen growth and expansion in both north dakota  south texas  and the permian basin region  primarily in the bakken  wolfcamp  and eagle ford formations  respectively
