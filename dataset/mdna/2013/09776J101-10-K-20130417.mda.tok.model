founded in  the company is one of the largest regional department store operators  currently operating stores in states in the northeast  midwest and upper great plains under the bon ton  bergner  boston store  carson  elder beerman  herberger and younkers nameplates

the company had net sales of billion in performance and accomplishments throughout  we took actions to stabilize and then reinvigorate our business while facing continued macroeconomic challenges  including weakness in consumer spending  that have impacted the retail industry 
our financial results  a net loss of million  do not reflect the full extent of our achievements 
income from operations increased as we grew our comparable store sales by  increased gross margin dollars and leveraged our sg a expense rate to a basis point improvement

as a result  growth in women apparel sales outpaced that of the company in the fall season 
we funded and grew important franchise businesses  such as women footwear and cosmetics  that warranted an expanded presence both in store and in our marketing vehicles 
we overhauled our promotional calendar to increase traffic in store  online and via mobile devices 
we focused on the strategic use of customer friendly savings coupons and added or strengthened signature promotional events  as well as increased our investment in advanced customer relationship management systems  using enhanced consumer analytics and insights to drive marketing effectiveness through targeted and personalized initiatives 
we executed a more disciplined approach to inventory management  particularly with regard to markdown cadence 
we adjusted our markdown process to allow greater flexibility within the product lifecycle  better allocating markdown dollars to those categories requiring price reductions for timely sell through 
additionally  we have taken an aggressive posture on our new clearance store strategy that allows us to liquidate the prior year merchandise in the proper season and achieve a higher margin than in years past

sales growth in coats was achieved in the fall season through timely merchandise receipts that more accurately reflected customer shopping patterns and marketing initiatives to sustain traffic 
growth in private brands and the expansion of updated nationally branded vendors to additional stores contributed to the success in better sportswear 
cosmetics sales increases were driven by strength in treatment lines and men and women fragrances  with both core and new launch fragrances contributing to the sales growth

the poorest performing categories in the period were furniture included in home and juniors apparel 
sales in furniture were adversely impacted by ongoing economic concerns and resultant customer reluctance to purchase higher priced items

the first amendment increased the tranche a revolving commitment to million  increased the margins applicable to borrowings under the tranche a revolving commitments by  and made certain other changes to the borrowing base calculations under the second amended revolving credit facility 
unamortized deferred financing fees of million associated with the second amended revolving credit facility were accelerated upon entry into the first amendment and were recognized in loss on exchange extinguishment of debt 
on january   we issued a notice of partial redemption for million aggregate principal amount of our old notes at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the redemption was completed on february   with associated interest of million  for a total payment of million 
the redemption was realized through additional borrowings on the second amended revolving credit facility and  as a result  the million of redeemed old notes was classified as long term debt as of february  the remaining outstanding million aggregate principal amount of old notes is expected to be paid in and  therefore  was classified as current maturities of long term debt as of february  consequently  the expected maturity date of the second amended revolving credit facility was classified as long term debt as of february  the expiration date of the second amended revolving credit facility heretofore for accounting purposes had been days prior to the maturity date of the old notes march  
given that the entirety of the old notes has been redeemed or is expected to be paid in  for accounting purposes the maturity date of the second amended revolving credit facility has  therefore  been extended to unamortized deferred financing fees of million associated with the old notes were accelerated upon redemption and were recognized in loss on exchange extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of at february   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under our second amended revolving credit facility before taking into account the minimum borrowing availability covenant under such facility 
excess availability was million as of the comparable prior year period 
the increase in excess availability reflects an increased borrowing base availability due to the aforementioned first amendment  partially offset by increased direct borrowings 
the year to year comparison of excess availability is impacted by the july receipt of a million signing bonus from our new credit card provider  the application of which decreased borrowings 
conversely  we utilized million of available monies for required qualified defined benefit pension plan funding in typically  cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry  a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business 
while the current economic uncertainty affects our assessment of short term liquidity  we consider our resources cash flows from operations supplemented by borrowings under the credit facility adequate to satisfy our cash needs 
while there can be no assurances  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to cover our short term funding needs  which includes the payment of the million of outstanding old notes 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our second amended revolving credit facility 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories prior to the holiday season 
the seasonality of our business historically provides greatest cash flow from operations during the holiday season  with fiscal fourth quarter net sales generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects the increase in the current year net loss and increased working capital requirements  partially offset by the change in loss gain on exchange extinguishment of debt 
increased working capital needs in were primarily the result of increases in merchandise inventories  without the commensurate increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments  and current year pension plan contributions  partially offset by the deferred gain associated with the signing bonus from our new credit card service provider 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects a decline in business performance  resulting in a net loss in as compared with net income in  partially offset by reduced working capital requirements and receipt of deferred income 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  these expenditures do not reflect reductions for external contributions primarily leasehold improvement and fixture allowances received from landlords or vendors of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  significant investment was made to support our strategic initiatives in opening and remodeling of stores  information technology  and systems enhancements in our ecommerce business 
we anticipate our capital expenditures will not exceed million excluding external contributions  primarily leasehold improvement and fixture allowances received from landlords or vendors  of million  reducing budgeted net capital investments to million 
projects include two new stores  ongoing store remodels  and continued information technology investments 
we believe these investments will drive growth and profitable returns 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in reflects net borrowings in the current year  largely due to reduced cash provided by operating activities as a result of increased working capital requirements and a decrease in the book overdraft balance 
net cash used in financing activities in was comparatively higher due to net debt payments as a result of greater cash provided by operating activities 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects reduced net debt payments and cash flow generated in partially used to support cash requirements for increased capital expenditures

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  the valuation of inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  insurance reserves  contingencies  litigation and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes and retirement and other post employment benefits  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely permanent markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include inventory obsolescence  excess inventories  current and anticipated demand  age of the merchandise  customer preferences and fashion trends 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
as of february  and january   approximately of the company merchandise inventories were valued using a first in  first out fifo cost basis and approximately of merchandise inventories were valued using a last in  first out lifo cost basis 
there was no effect on costs of merchandise sold for lifo valuations in  and if the fifo method of inventory valuation had been used for all inventories  the company merchandise inventories would have been lower by million at february  and january  due to the company having recognized prior years cost increases associated with its lifo calculations 
the company lifo calculations yielded inventory increases due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicated to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  the company has reduced the carrying value of its lifo inventories to an estimated realizable value  with reductions of million to offset the million cumulative inventory increases generated by its computation of lifo inventory as of february  and with reductions of million to offset the million cumulative inventory increases generated by its computation of lifo inventory as of january  vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are recorded when determined to be collectable 
allowances are credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is for merchandise permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  and not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
to the extent the reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor products and do not exceed the costs incurred  they are recognized as a reduction of sg a expense 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we are required to assess whether valuation allowances should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must generally be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
we reported net deferred tax liabilities of million and million at february  and january   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based upon all available evidence  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical operating results  projected future operating results  tax carry back availability and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  among others 
significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result  current or previous losses are given more weight than any projected future taxable income 
in addition  a recent three year historical cumulative loss is considered a significant element of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each reporting period  including assessment of the company cumulative income or loss over the prior three year period  to determine if valuation allowances are required 
with respect to our reviews during  and  our three year historical cumulative loss and the continuation of uncertain near term economic conditions impeded our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in assessing valuation allowance requirements 
as such  we concluded it was necessary to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaled million and million at february  and january   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard for realization  the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly in the period that such a conclusion is reached 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and changes to our assumptions and judgments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at february  and january   respectively 
we are required to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value are determined through various techniques  including discounted cash flow models utilizing a discount rate the company believes is appropriate and would be used by market participants and market approaches using data that includes recent sales of comparable properties with similar characteristics  as considered necessary 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets and  as a result  in we recognized impairment charges of million which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain marginally performing store properties 
in and we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store and distribution center properties 
these analyses anticipate certain economic conditions 
should economic conditions be worse than anticipated  additional impairment charges could result 
intangible assets net intangible assets totaled million and million at february  and january   respectively 
our intangible assets at february  are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trade names  private label brand names and customer lists 
the lease related interests are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at february   lease related interests and customer lists had average remaining lives of years and six years  respectively  for amortization purposes 
at february   trade names and private label brand names of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors  and utilizes a discount rate the company believes is appropriate and would be used by market participants 
intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying value of these assets exceeds their implied fair values 
in determining fair value for these intangible assets  the company utilizes a relief from royalty method to determine the assets fair value 
the relief from royalty method estimates the theoretical royalty savings from ownership of these intangible assets 
key assumptions include royalty rates  sales projections and discount rates 
the company utilizes royalty and discount rates it believes are appropriate and would be used by market participants 
the company policy is to conduct impairment testing based on its most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to a reduction in the value of three indefinite lived private label brand names 
as a result of the decline in our business performance in  we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million on three indefinite lived trade names and one private label brand name  respectively 
no adjustment was required pursuant to our review of the carrying amount of intangible assets in should significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  future results or economic events cause us to adjust our projected cash flows  future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
pension and supplementary retirement plans we provide an unfunded non qualified defined benefit supplementary pension plan to certain key executives 
through acquisitions  we acquired a qualified defined benefit pension plan and assumed the liabilities of non qualified defined benefit supplementary pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the defined benefit plan assets 
the discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
we utilize the citibank pension discount curve to develop the discount rate assumption 
a single constant discount rate is developed based on the expected timing of the benefit payments 
we base our asset return assumption on current and expected allocations of assets  as well as a long term view of expected returns on the plan asset categories 
we assess the appropriateness of the expected rate of return on an annual basis and  when necessary  revise the assumption 
at february   our target pension plan asset allocation was equity securities  fixed income and hedge funds 
changes in the assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets may result in materially different expense and liability amounts 
actuarial estimations may differ materially from actual results  reflecting many factors including changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  the funded status of this plan and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  particularly in the current economic environment 
losses of asset values of the defined benefit pension plan may require us to fund obligations earlier than we forecasted in order to meet minimum federal government requirements  which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it requires only a change in the format of presentation 
in july  asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  was issued  amending fasb accounting standards codification topic asc to simplify the impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets by allowing an entity to make a qualitative impairment assessment 
entities are required to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the addition of the optional qualitative assessment permits an entity to consider events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and if the entity concludes  based on an evaluation of all relevant qualitative factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  it will not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test for that asset 
the amendments to asc made by asu are effective for interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after september  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate borrowing facilities  we have previously entered into  and may in the future enter into  interest rate swap agreements to change the fixed variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain an appropriate balance of fixed rate and variable rate debt and to mitigate the impact of volatile interest rates 
we have not entered into new interest rate swap agreements since the expiration of our prior interest rate swaps on july  during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at february  expected maturity date by year dollars in thousands there after total fair value debt fixed rate debt average fixed rate variable rate debt average variable rate at february   million of our old notes was outstanding 
on january   we issued a notice of partial redemption for million of these notes  the transaction was completed on february  through additional borrowings on the second amended revolving credit facility 
as a result  variable rate debt includes million of the old notes 
fixed rate debt expected to mature in includes million of the old notes as we expect to pay this obligation in variable rate debt includes the second amended revolving credit facility that expires on the earlier of a march  and b the date that is days prior to the earlier of the maturity date of the old notes and the mortgage loan facility 
since the old notes have either been redeemed or are expected to be paid in see note above  the expected maturity of the second amended revolving credit facility is in seasonality and inflation our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each fiscal year  which includes the holiday season 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
while we experienced some inflationary conditions in our merchandise and transportation costs in the spring season of and throughout  we are anticipating merchandise cost decreases of approximately eight percent in the spring season of from spring levels  and merchandise costs ranging from flat to decreases of approximately six percent in fall from fall
