at march   the company had an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans 
the decrease in the balance of the allowance for loan losses at march  compared to a year ago reflects the decreased levels of non performing and classified loans  decreased charge offs  the decline in the loan portfolio and recently stabilizing real estate values 
nonperforming loans decreased million and day delinquent loans increased  during the year ended march  classified loans were million at march  compared to million at march  the decrease in nonperforming and classified assets can be attributed to the company s efforts to reduce its level of nonperforming and classified assets through write downs  collections and modifications 
the coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at march  compared to at march  this coverage ratio increased from march  primarily as a result of the decrease in nonperforming loans

the additional reserves associated with these impaired loans totaled  at march  the company s general valuation allowance to non impaired loans was at march  and management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio and the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
however  a further decline in local economic conditions  results of examinations by the company s regulators  or other factors could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses will be adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate or should collateral values further decline as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document

a million investment security that the company currently holds is a collateralized debt obligation cdo secured by trust preferred securities issued by other bank holding companies 
there was no impairment charge of this security for the years ended march   or management believes that it is probable that principal payments will exceed the company s recorded investment in this security  that the company does not intend to sell this security and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell this security before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis 
at march   the market for the company s cdo was determined to be inactive in management s judgment 
this determination was made by the company after considering the last known trade date for this specific security  the low number of transactions for similar types of securities  the significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade  the low number of new issuances for similar securities  the significant increase in the implied liquidity risk premium for similar securities  the lack of information that is released publicly and discussions with third party industry analysts 
due to the inactivity in the market  observable market data was not readily available for all significant inputs for this security 
accordingly  the trust preferred pooled security was classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
consistent with previous valuations  the company determined that an income approach valuation technique using cash flows and present value techniques that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs was the most appropriate valuation technique 
management used significant unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions of what a market participant would use to price this security 
significant unobservable inputs included selecting an appropriate discount rate  default rate and repayment assumptions 
the company estimated the discount rate by comparing rates for similarly rated corporate bonds  with additional consideration given to market liquidity 
the default rates and repayment assumptions were estimated based on the individual issuer s financial condition  historical repayment information  as well as our future expectations of the capital markets 
using this information  the company estimated the fair value of the security at march  to be million 
additionally  the company received two independent level valuation estimates for this security 
those valuation estimates were based on proprietary pricing models utilizing significant unobservable inputs 
although the company s estimate of fair value fell outside the range of valuations provided  the magnitude in the range of fair value estimates further supported the difficulty in estimating the fair value for these types of securities in the current environment 
additionally  the company believes that some of the assumptions used by the independent parties were overly aggressive and unrealistic 
therefore  the company believes its valuation at march  is reasonable
