we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and other energy based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide 
we offer easy to use products based on eight platforms coolglide  xeo  solera  genesisplustm  excelvtm  myqtm  varilitetm and trusculpttm each of which enables physicians and other qualified practitioners to perform safe and effective aesthetic procedures for their customers 
the xeo and solera platforms offer multiple hand pieces and applications  which allow customers to upgrade their systems  which we treat as upgrade revenue 
in addition to systems and upgrade revenue  we generate revenue from the sale of post warranty service contracts  providing services for products that are out of warranty  titan and trusculpt hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals 
in february  we acquired certain assets of iridex corporation s global aesthetic business and added their varilite product and their service business into our operations 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  from where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research and development  regulatory  sales and marketing  service  and administrative activities 
in the united states  we market  sell and service our products through direct sales and service employees  and a distribution relationship with pss world medical shared services  inc pss  a wholly owned subsidiary of pss world medical which has over sales representatives serving physician offices throughout the united states 
we also sell certain items such as our titan hand piece refills and marketing brochures online 
international sales are generally made through direct sales employees and a worldwide distributor network in over countries 
outside of the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france and japan 

table of contents products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  upgrades  service  titan and trusculpt hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products 
product revenue represents the sale of a system 
a system consists of a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser and or other energy based module  control system software and high voltage electronics  as well as one or more hand pieces 
however  depending on the application  the laser or other energy based module is sometimes contained in the hand piece such as with our pearl and pearl fractional applications instead of within the console 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows 
this provides customers the flexibility to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue which we classify as upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of prepaid service contracts  direct billings for detachable hand piece replacements and revenue for parts and labor on out of warranty products 
for our titan and trusculpt hand pieces  after a set number of treatments have been performed  the customer is required to send the hand piece back to the factory for refurbishment  which we refer to as refilling the hand piece 
in japan  we distribute merz pharma gmbh s merz radiesse dermal filler product  and obagi medical products  inc s obagi cosmeceutical products 
significant business trends 
we believe that our ability to grow revenue will be primarily dependent on the following continuing to expand our product offerings both through internal development and sourcing from other vendors 
ongoing investment in our global sales and marketing infrastructure 
use of clinical results to support new aesthetic products and applications 
enhanced luminary development and reference selling efforts to develop a location where our products can be displayed and used to assist in selling efforts 
customer demand for our products 
consumer demand for the application of our products 
marketing to physicians in the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties  as well as outside those specialties 
generating ongoing revenue from our growing installed base of customers through the sale of service  upgrade  titan and trusculpt hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceutical products 
our us revenue increased by and our international revenue increased by in  compared to we believe the increase in us revenues was attributable to several factors  including continued growth of excelv shipments  which began shipping in the second quarter of commencement of trusculpt shipments in the third quarter of incremental revenue from the iridex aesthetic acquisition in february expansion of our direct sales force in the united states 
improvements in the us macroeconomic environment 
our total international revenue increased by in  compared to  and represented of our total revenue 
the international revenue growth was sourced primarily from japan  france  and several of our international distributor countries 
in japan  our revenue increased by  primarily as a result of product sales and continued growth from our dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals business 
our gross margin declined to in  compared to in  which was attributable to several factors  including a product mix shift towards lower margin products  an increase in service revenue primarily as a result of the acquisition of the iridex service business that has a lower margin than our blended margin  and an increase in sales through distributors  which typically has a lower margin than our direct revenue 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared with million in this increase was associated with higher personnel expenses and an increase in travel and entertainment expenses associated with the increase in revenue  along with increased product demonstration related expenses 
as a percentage of net revenue  our sales and marketing expenses declined to  compared to in  due to the higher revenue in our research and development  or r d  expenses decreased to million in  compared with million in this decrease was associated with reduced personnel expenses resulting primarily from lower headcount and a decrease in material spending due to the timing  complexity and material component costs of the product being developed 
as a percentage of net revenue  r d expenses decreased to in  compared to in due primarily to the higher revenue in 
table of contents our general and administrative  or g a  expenses increased to million in  compared with million in this increase was due primarily to approximately  of non recurring integration expenses associated with the iridex business acquisition  higher legal and accounting fees and increase personnel expenses  partially offset by a decrease in facility costs associated with the relocation of one of our japan offices and the closure of our switzerland in and spanish offices march 
as a percentage of net revenue  g a expenses decreased to in  compared to in  due to the higher revenue in factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our industry is highly competitive and our future performance depends on our ability to compete successfully 
additionally  our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our product offerings with innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
if we fail to execute on the aforementioned initiatives  our business would be adversely affected 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in part i  item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of products  upgrades  titan and trusculpt hand piece refills  and dermal fillers and cosmeceuticals when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  are based on management s evaluation regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectability has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the later of meeting all acceptance criteria or the cash receipt 
we frequently enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services 
judgments are required as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement 
for multiple element arrangements entered into on or after january   we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
because we have neither vendor specific objective evidence vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price tpe for our systems  the allocation of revenue has been based on our best estimate of selling prices besp 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for our deliverables by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  features and functionality of the system  geographies  type of customer and market conditions 
typically  for our sales transactions involving systems and services  we deliver all system components to the customer at the same time and we defer the revenue for any undelivered the service component of the arrangement 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 

table of contents stock based compensation expense stock options we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of us gaap 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeiture rate  and expected risk free interest rate and dividend rate over the expected term 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise of options by employees 
we use historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to stock price movements to derive an employee behavioral pattern used to forecast expected exercise patterns 
we estimate volatility based on historical volatility and we also consider implied volatility when there is sufficient volume of freely traded options with comparable terms and exercise prices in the open market 
us gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share based compensation  as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted 
we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate  we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed 
adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods 
changes in expected risk free interest rate and dividend rate do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value  and determining this input is not highly subjective 
changes in the subjective assumptions of expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of income 
restricted stock units we grant restricted stock unit rsu awards to our management employees  officers and directors 
rsus are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant and the stock based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period using the straight line method 
shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees 
as a result  the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of rsus outstanding 
furthermore  we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid in capital when paid 
performance stock units performance stock unit psu awards were granted in for the first time to our officers 
psus are issued at target and the final award amount is determined at the end of the performance period  subject to the recipient s continued service through that date 
psus are measured based on the fair market value on the dates of grant of the target number of underlying shares 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period using the straight line method and the expected degree of achievement of the performance goals 
at the vest date  we will issue fully paid up common stock  net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our officers 
as a result  the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of psus outstanding 
furthermore  we will record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid in capital when paid 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include sub licenses and those acquired in conjunction with an acquisition in all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
in february  we acquired the global aesthetic business unit of iridex corporation  which included various laser systems such as the varilite and gemini and an installed base of customers  whose products are being serviced by us 
this acquisition was considered a business combination for accounting purposes  and as such  in addition to valuing all the assets  we recorded goodwill associated with the expected synergies from leveraging the customer relationships and integrating new product offerings into our business 
the fair values of the assets acquired were determined to be million of net tangible and intangible assets and million of goodwill 

table of contents identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their carrying value 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangibles based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets 
if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful amortization lives for the intangible assets involves judgments and the use of estimates 
the evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated  we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets new  shorter useful lives 
no impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended december    and a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment  which includes financial forecasts 
should conditions be different from management s current estimates  material write downs of long lived assets may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary  to reflect changes in raw material costs  labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates 
we provide for excess and obsolete inventories when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory provisions are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value and charged to cost of revenue to establish a lower cost basis for the inventories 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory provisions that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product that had previously been written off is sold 
warranty obligations we provide a one year standard warranty on all systems 
warranty coverage provided is for labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale  and as reviewed and updated quarterly  of the total costs that we expect to incur in repairing or replacing product parts that fail while still under warranty 
accrued warranty costs include costs of material  technical support labor and associated overhead 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update based on historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future due to actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differing from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would negatively impact our operating results 
provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes on earnings 
we perform a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 

table of contents our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance  foreign operations  research and development tax credits  state taxes  and certain benefits realized related to stock option activity 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes  should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
the effective tax rate was approximately in  in  and in our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower in countries where we have lower statutory rates and being higher in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in tax laws  accounting principles  interpretations thereof  net operating loss carryback  research and development tax credits  and due to changes in the valuation allowance of our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been  or are intended to be  indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
depending on the timing and nature of the distribution  if the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted while the company is able to utilize its net operating losses  it is likely there would be no material additional tax resulting from the distribution 
our deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  which assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
we have fully reserved our us federal and state deferred tax assets due to our history of operating losses 
litigation we have been  and may in the future become  subject to legal proceedings related to securities litigation  intellectual property  product liability claims  contractual disputes and other matters 
based on all available information at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable loss 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we record an estimated liability

these forecasted time horizons can vary among different suppliers 
our open inventory purchase commitments were not material at december  as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
income tax liability we have included in our consolidated balance sheet  in long term income tax liability with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest as of december  at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
other in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations  warranties  and indemnification obligations 
for example  we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers 
our exposure under the various indemnification obligations is unknown and not reasonably estimable as they involve future claims that may be made against us 
as such  we have not accrued any amounts for such obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and municipal bonds  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single type of investment or issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity of generally less than eighteen months 
based on discounted cash flow modeling with respect to our total investment portfolio as of december  and  assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio would have potentially declined by approximately  and  respectively
