item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements  including as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
see special note regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of this report and risk factors set forth in item a of this report 
executive summary we are a leading north american designer and manufacturer of hopper and tank railcars 
we provide our railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high quality products and related services offered by our three reportable segments manufacturing  railcar leasing and railcar services 
manufacturing consists of railcar manufacturing and railcar and industrial component manufacturing 
railcar leasing consists of railcars manufactured by us and leased to third parties under operating leases 
railcar services consist of railcar repair services  engineering and field services  and fleet management services 
although we began expanding our railcar leasing activity during  it was not required to be reported as a separate segment until the first quarter of accordingly  in we separately presented the results of the leasing business  which had previously been reported in the manufacturing segment 
to maintain comparability  prior periods have been restated to separately present the leasing segment s results 
the north american railcar market has been  and we expect it to continue to be highly cyclical 
we have seen significant improvements in the railcar manufacturing market over the past two years 
we cannot assure you that the railcar market will continue to improve or that our railcar orders and shipments will continue to increase 
for the year ended december   we achieved record earnings from operations and record earnings per share 
during the year ended december   our railcar shipments and manufacturing revenues increased compared to the same period in the prior year and the gross profit margin of our manufacturing segment increased 
our railcar shipments  including railcars manufactured for lease  of approximately  railcars in surpassed our shipments of approximately  railcars due to a strong demand profile in the tank railcar market 
in response to the increased customer demand seen in  primarily in the tank railcar market  we increased production rates at our tank railcar manufacturing facilities and intend to continue to make adjustments at our railcar manufacturing plants as demand requires 
our railcar leasing revenues increased significantly in compared to as we increased our lease fleet to approximately  railcars 
on a consolidated basis  the gross profit margin on our manufacturing segment increased to in compared to in as of december   we have a backlog of approximately  railcars  up from a total backlog of approximately  railcars as of december  our backlog as of december  included approximately  railcars that are being manufactured for lease

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had net working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had million outstanding of our senior unsecured notes 
additionally in december  we completed a lease fleet financing with availability of million of which we drew down million at closing as described below 
see below for discussion on our outstanding and available debt  our cash flow activities and our future liquidity 
outstanding and available debt senior unsecured notes in february  we issued the notes in an outstanding principal amount of million 
in september  we completed a voluntary partial early redemption of million of the notes at a rate of of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
on march   we completed a voluntary redemption of the remaining million of notes outstanding at a redemption rate of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
lease fleet financing in december  we completed a financing of our railcar lease fleet with availability of up to million 
this financing was done through our wholly owned subsidiary  longtrain leasing i  llc longtrain leasing 
this debt is an obligation of longtrain leasing that is generally non recourse to ari and is secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases 
the financing consists of a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility that matures in february the amount of the draws may not exceed the lesser of i million and ii of the net aggregate equipment value 
in conjunction with this financing  we made an initial draw of million  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the terms of the lease fleet financing contain certain covenants  all of which we were in compliance with as of december  during february  we made a second draw of million under this lease fleet financing  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
principal and interest payments are due monthly beginning march  in an aggregate annual amount equal to of the then outstanding principal amount thereof  with any remaining balance payable on february  the financing is secured by a first lien on substantially all assets of longtrain leasing  consisting of railcars  railcar leases  receivables and related assets  subject to limited exceptions 
the company is obligated to make any selections of transfers of railcars  railcar leases  receivables and related assets to be conveyed to longtrain leasing in good faith and without any adverse selection  to cause arl  as the manager  to maintain  lease  and re lease longtrain leasing s equipment no less favorably than similar portfolios serviced by arl and to repurchase or replace railcars that are reported as eligible units as defined in the credit agreement when they are not eligible units  subject to limitations on liability set forth in the credit agreement 
the borrowings under the lease fleet financing are solely the obligations of longtrain leasing 
ari has  however  entered into certain agreements relating to its transfer of certain railcars  railcar leases  receivables associated with such railcars and leases  and other related assets  to longtrain leasing and other agreements regarding the lease fleet financing 
these agreements contain certain representations  undertakings  and indemnities customary for asset sellers and parent companies in transactions of this type 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our accounts receivables  processing of payroll and associated taxes and payments to our suppliers 
vs 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities increased primarily due to an improvement in earnings from operations driven by an increase in railcar shipments on improved customer demand 
another factor for the increase in cash provided by operations is the impact of deferred income taxes  which increased primarily due to an increase in railcars added to our lease fleet that received the benefit of bonus accelerated depreciation 
the remainder of the increase was driven by changes in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by changes in accounts payable 
those items increased at a slower rate in compared to primarily due to a ramp up of production rates toward the end of that drove increases in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of a rebound in demand in  partially offset by a correlating increase in accounts payable in related to the increase in inventory 
shipment rates toward the end of were consistent with those experienced in vs 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities improved primarily due to an improvement in earnings from operations in compared to a loss in primarily driven by an increase in railcar shipments on improved customer demand 
another factor for the increase in cash provided by operations is the impact of deferred income taxes  which increased primarily due to an increase in railcars added to our lease fleet that received the benefit of bonus accelerated depreciation 
additionally  in we received a tax refund of million related to a prior year net operating loss whereas no tax refund was received in the remainder of the increase was primarily driven by changes in accounts payable offset by changes in inventory 
those items increased at a faster rate in compared to primarily as a result of a rebound in demand in cash flow from investing activities vs 
our net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used was primarily the result of increased spending for further expansion of our lease fleet in  as well as an increase in spending on capital projects and the purchase of short term investments  all of which were partially offset by the sale of a portion of our short term investments and decreased investments in our joint ventures in vs 
our net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used was primarily due to the beginning of the expansion of our lease fleet and the sale of short term investments in  all of which were partially offset by lower investments in our joint ventures in 
table of contents capital expenditures we continuously evaluate facility requirements based on our strategic plans  production requirements and market demand and may elect to change our level of capital investments in the future 
these investments are all based on an analysis of the estimated rates of return and impact on our profitability 
we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our costs through continued vertical integration of component parts 
from time to time  we may expand our business  domestically or abroad  by acquiring other businesses or pursuing other strategic growth opportunities including  without limitation  joint ventures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including million related to manufacturing railcars for lease to others  as well as costs that were capitalized for projects that will expand capabilities  maintain equipment  improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
cash flow from financing activities vs 
our net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used was primarily the result of an early redemption of million of our senior unsecured notes as well as dividends of million paid in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of million of debt under our lease fleet financing 
see discussion of dividends below 
vs 
our net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided was a result of the proceeds from an increase in stock options exercised in january dividends during december  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share of our common stock that was paid on december  prior to this payment  the company had not paid any dividends since july any decision to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our operating results  strategic plans  capital improvements  financial condition  debt covenants and other factors 
future liquidity our current liquidity consists of our existing cash balance  remaining availability under our lease fleet financing and future cash from operations 
given our strategic emphasis on growing our lease fleet and the capital required to manufacture railcars for lease for which we currently have firm orders  we expect that our longer term cash needs may require additional financing over and above our current liquidity position after considering the second draw under the lease fleet financing and the full repayment of our senior unsecured notes  as discussed above 
we expect our future cash flows from operations could be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the overall economy  the number of our railcar orders and shipments and our production rates 
our future liquidity may also be impacted by the number of our new railcar orders leased versus sold 
our operating performance may also be affected by other matters discussed under risk factors  and trends and uncertainties discussed in this discussion and analysis  as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect our long term liquidity 
our current capital expenditure plans for include projects that we expect will expand capabilities  maintain equipment  improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
capital expenditures for are projected to be approximately million to million  which includes additions to our lease fleet 
we also plan to increase our railcar lease fleet in to meet customer demand for leased railcars that have been ordered 
we cannot assure that we will be able to complete any of our projects on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance  our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our lease fleet financing and any other indebtedness we may enter into  and our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other investments  including additions to our lease fleet 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
other potential projects  including possible strategic transactions that could complement and expand our business units  will be evaluated to determine if the project or opportunity is right for us 
we anticipate that any future expansion of our business will be financed through existing resources  cash flow from operations  term debt associated directly with that project or other new financing 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet existing financial covenants or obtain term debt or other new financing on favorable terms  if at all 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations senior unsecured notes lease fleet financing interest payments on senior unsecured notes interest payments on lease fleet financing  pension and postretirement funding capital project related total the operating lease commitment includes the future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases for property and equipment leased by us 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these notes 
the senior unsecured notes were fully extinguished at par on march  see note of the consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the lease fleet financing 
on february   we drew another million on the facility that carries the same maturity and interest rate as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate on the lease fleet facility is libor plus and is payable monthly 
at december  libor was and was used to project interest payments into the future 
our pension funding commitments include minimum funding contributions required by law for our two funded pension plans as well as expected benefit payments for our one unfunded pension plan 
represents the costs for materials and to third parties related to various capital projects 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table above  our gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits of million 
while it is uncertain as to the amount  if any  of these unrecognized tax benefits that will be settled by means of a cash payment  we reasonably expect some change to this balance of up to million to occur within the next twelve months 
in july  we entered into an agreement with axis to purchase new railcar axles 
we do not have any minimum volume purchase requirements under this agreement 
other than operating leases  we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
contingencies we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
these laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities  and negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
certain real property we acquired from acf in has been involved in investigation and remediation activities to address contamination 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of these properties prior to their transfer to us by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
as of the date of this report  we do not believe that we will incur material costs in connection with any investigation or remediation activities relating to these properties  but we cannot assure that this will be the case 
if acf fails to honor its obligations to us  we could be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents on september   a complaint was filed by george tedder the plaintiff against us in the us district court  eastern district of arkansas 
the plaintiff alleged that we were liable for an injury that resulted during the plaintiff s break on april  at the initial trial on april   the jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff 
after ari appealed the initial ruling  the judge reduced the amount awarded to the plaintiff  which was fully accrued at december  in january  we filed an appeal related to the revised ruling but do not believe that any resolution to the case will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are from time to time party to various other legal proceedings arising out of our business 
such proceedings  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we believe that there are no proceedings pending against us that  were the outcome to be unfavorable  would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates and policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
a summary of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of these policies involve a high degree of judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies  in management s judgment  are those described below 
if different assumptions or conditions prevail  or if our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results could be materially different from those reported 
revenue recognition revenues from railcar sales are recognized following completion of manufacturing  inspection  customer acceptance and title transfer  which is when the risk for any damage or loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer 
revenues from railcar leasing are recognized on a straight line basis per terms of the lease 
if railcars are sold under an operating lease that is less than one year old  the proceeds from the railcars sold that were on lease will be shown on a gross basis in revenues and cost of revenues at the time of sale 
sales of railcars on operating leases that have been on lease for more than one year are recognized as a net gain or loss from the disposal of the long term asset as a component of earnings from operations 
revenues from railcar and industrial components are recorded at the time of product shipment  in accordance with our contractual terms 
revenues from railcar maintenance services are recognized upon completion and shipment of railcars from our plants 
we do not currently bundle railcar service contracts with new railcar sales 
revenues from fleet management  engineering and field services are recognized as performed 
revenues related to consulting type contracts are accounted for under the proportional performance method 
profits expected to be realized on these contracts are based on the total contract revenues and costs based on the estimate of the percentage of project completion 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are recorded to unbilled revenues and included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
billings in excess of revenues recognized on in progress contracts are recorded to unbilled costs and included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the term of the contracts and any adjustments are recorded on a cumulative basis in the period the revisions are made 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of our production facilities 
if any of our production facilities are not operating at normal capacity  unallocated production overheads are recognized as a current period charge 
we evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case  the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during the year ended december   no triggering events occurred 
the criteria for determining impairment of such long lived assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to be held and used to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the long lived assets 
if the long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
the estimated fair value of the long lived assets is measured by estimating the present value of the future discounted cash flows to be generated 
the north american railcar market has been  and we expect it to continue to be highly cyclical  generally fluctuating in correlation with the us economy 
we continually monitor our long lived assets for impairment in response to events or changes in circumstances 
goodwill in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance related to goodwill that allows companies to first consider qualitative factors as a basis for assessing impairment and determining the necessity of a detailed impairment test 
as of december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with a past business acquisition  all allocated to a reporting unit that is part of our manufacturing operations segment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of as a result  the company performed the qualitative goodwill analysis as of march   noting no indicators of impairment 
since march   no significant or unusual events have occurred that would indicate a change in valuation 
if there were indicators of impairment present  we would test for impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  which is determined using a combination of methods  including management s best estimate of future discounted cash flows expected to result from the business 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered impaired and the impairment recognized equals such difference 
when performing an impairment evaluation  we have historically utilized the market and income approaches and significant assumptions in our evaluation 
in our qualitative evaluation  the income approach was utilized 
see note and of the consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding these approaches 
product warranties we record a liability for an estimate of costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranty when manufacturing revenue is recognized 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are up to one year for parts and services and five years for new railcars 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and costs per claim 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the adequacy of our warranty liability based on changes in these factors 
actual results differing from estimates could have a material effect on results from operations in the event that unforeseen warranty issues were to occur 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense or benefit is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position on a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different from that taken by us  differences in a tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
any such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the consolidated financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate for recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
it is possible that some or all of our deferred tax assets could ultimately expire unused 

table of contents pension and postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and mortality and retirement rates  as discussed below discount rates the discount rate assumptions used to determine the december  benefit obligations were for our pension plans and for our postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine the net periodic cost were for our pension plans and for our postretirement benefit plans 
we review these rates annually and adjust them to reflect current conditions 
we deemed these rates appropriate based on the citigroup pension discount curve analysis along with expected payments to retirees 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets for our funded pension plans of for is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumptions are primarily long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality and retirement rates mortality and retirement rates are based on actual and anticipated plan experience 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension plans change in assumption effect on pre tax pension expense effect on december  projected benefit obligation in thousands decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected return on assets n a increase in expected return on assets n a this sensitivity analysis reflects the effects of changing one assumption 
various economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
a change in the discount rate for our postretirement benefit plans would be immaterial 
environmental certain real property we acquired from acf in has been involved in investigation and remediation activities to address contamination 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of these properties prior to their transfer to us by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
as of the date of this report  we do not believe that we will incur material costs in connection with any investigation or remediation activities relating to these properties  but we cannot assure that this will be the case 
if acf fails to honor its obligations to us  we could be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
further  we cannot assure that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings  or that we will be able to recover under our indemnity provisions if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  or that such costs would not be material to us 
share based compensation our share based awards have included stock options  stock appreciation rights sars and restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes merton black scholes and monte carlo models to estimate the fair value of our equity instrument awards and other share based awards issued under the equity incentive plan 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the equity award  future volatility  dividend yield  forfeiture rate and the risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected term of sars based on sec staff accounting bulletin official text topic d  which addressed the expected term aspect of the black scholes model 
it stated that companies that did not have adequate exercise history on equity instruments were allowed to use the simplified method prescribed by the sec  which called for an average of the vesting period and the expiration period of grants with plain vanilla characteristics 
these characteristics included service based vesting instruments granted at the money along with certain other requirements 

table of contents our sars have fair value estimates that are generated from the black scholes calculation 
this calculation requires inputs as mentioned above that may require some judgment or estimation 
we use our best judgment at the time of valuation to estimate fair value on the sars 
all sars granted are classified as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  given that they settle in cash  and thus  must be revalued every period 
as such  the fair value estimates on the sars we granted to our employees are subject to volatility inherent in the stock price since it is based on current market values at the end of every period 
share based compensation on all equity awards is expensed using a graded vesting method over the vesting period of the instrument 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  amounts due to from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is determined by the market close price and trading levels 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials  especially steel and heavy castings 
the cost of steel  heavy castings and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represents more than half of our direct manufacturing costs per railcar 
given the significant volatility in the price of raw materials  this exposure can affect our costs of production 
we believe that the risk to our margins and profitability has been somewhat reduced by the variable pricing provisions in place with our current railcar manufacturing contracts 
these contracts adjust the purchase prices of our railcars to reflect fluctuations in the cost of certain raw materials and components and  as a result  we are able to pass on to our customers any increased raw material and component costs with respect to the railcars we plan to produce and deliver to them during or we believe that we currently have good supplier relationships and do not currently anticipate that material constraints will limit our production capacity 
such constraints may exist if railcar production was to increase beyond current levels  or other economic changes were to occur that affect the availability of our raw materials 
our earnings could be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligation  which represented approximately of our total debt as of december   but represents of our total debt as of this filing 
as this variable rate debt obligation was entered into as of december  we incurred million of interest expense in related to such obligation 
for the interest incurred under the lease fleet financing  a one percentage point increase in the rate in fiscal year would have a nominal impact on our interest expense
