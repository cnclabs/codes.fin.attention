the special distribution was paid on december  to holders of record of loral voting and non voting common stock as of november  in accordance with loral s stock incentive plan  an equitable adjustment was made to outstanding stock based awards to reflect the special distribution 
certain holders of restricted stock units rsus who elected to receive the special distribution at the per share value will receive additional payments totaling million on their rsu settlement dates 

table of contents description of business subsequent to the sale  loral has one operating segment consisting of satellite based communications services 
loral participates in satellite services operations through its ownership interest in telesat holdings inc telesat holdco which owns telesat canada telesat  a leading global fixed satellite services operator  with offices and facilities around the world 
telesat provides its satellite and communication services from a fleet of satellites that occupy canadian and other orbital locations 
loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in telesat  the world s fourth largest satellite operator with approximately billion of backlog as of december  our economic interest in telesat decreased from to in december when certain key employees of telesat exercised a total of  stock options granted under telesat s share based compensation plan in exchange for  non voting preferred shares 
at december   telesat provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of in orbit satellites 
in addition  telesat owns the canadian payload on the viasat satellite and has one satellite  anik g  which telesat anticipates will be launched in the first half of the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once the investment in a satellite is made  the incremental costs to maintain and operate the satellite are relatively low over the life of the satellite  with the exception of in orbit insurance 
telesat has been able to generate a large contracted revenue backlog by entering into long term contracts with some of its customers for all or substantially all of a satellite s life 
historically  this has resulted in revenue from the satellite services business being fairly predictable 
telesat s commitment to providing strong customer service and its focus on innovation and technical expertise has allowed it to successfully build its business to date 
building on its existing contractual revenue backlog  telesat s focus is on taking disciplined steps to grow its core business and sell newly launched and existing in orbit satellite services  and  in a disciplined manner  use the cash flow generated by existing business  contracted expansion satellites and cost savings to strengthen the business 
telesat believes its satellite fleet produces a strong combination of ongoing revenue from backlog  continuing revenue growth and an effective foundation upon which it will seek to continue to grow its revenue and cash flows 
the growth is expected to come from the sale of available capacity on its existing in orbit satellites  the canadian payload on the viasat satellite which launched in october  the nimiq satellite which launched in may and the anik g satellite which is expected to launch in the first half of with nimiq commencing service in june  telesat s customer returned the nimiq satellite on october  telesat intends to use nimiq to pursue other revenue growth opportunities 
telesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates 
telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers who will commit to long term service agreements prior to the time the satellite construction contract is signed 
although telesat regularly pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  it does not procure additional or replacement satellites until it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such satellite capacity 
telesat anticipates that the relatively fixed cost nature of the business  combined with contracted revenue growth and other growth opportunities  will produce growth in operating income and cash flow 

table of contents in  telesat will remain focused on increasing utilization on its existing satellites  continuing the preparation for the launch and deployment of the anik g satellite  identifying and pursuing opportunities to expand its satellite fleet and maintaining cost and operating discipline 
on march   telesat entered into a new credit agreement the telesat credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which provided for the extension of credit under the following senior credit facilities in the principal amount of up to approximately billion together  the telesat senior credit facilities i a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to cad million  available in either canadian or us dollars  maturing on march   ii a term loan a facility denominated in canadian dollars  in the amount of cad million  maturing on march   iii a term loan b facility denominated in canadian dollars  in the amount of cad million  maturing on march   and iv a term loan b facility denominated in us dollars  in the amount of billion  maturing on march  simultaneously with entering into the telesat credit agreement  telesat terminated and paid all outstanding amounts under its previous credit facilities 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  on march   telesat redeemed all of its outstanding senior preferred shares  previously held by an affiliate of the public sector pension investment board psp  for approximately cad million in cash  which was equal to the outstanding liquidation value and accrued dividends on the senior preferred shares 
following the redemption of the senior preferred shares  an affiliate of psp provided a loan in the amount of approximately cad million to telesat  in the form of a subordinated promissory note 
in connection with the closing of the telesat credit agreement  telesat s board declared a special cash distribution to its shareholders  as a reduction of stated capital  in the amount of approximately cad million 
loral s share of this amount was approximately cad million 
on march   telesat paid its shareholders approximately cad million of the special distribution  which was funded by the proceeds from the telesat senior credit facilities and excess cash from operations 
of this amount  loral received approximately cad million million 
the approximately cad million distribution remaining was paid in july  with loral receiving approximately cad million million 
in connection with the cash distribution made to telesat s shareholders  telesat s board also authorized approximately cad million in special payments to executives and certain employees of telesat 
on march   as a direct result of the special cash distribution by telesat to its shareholders discussed above  the loral board of directors declared a special dividend of per share for an aggregate dividend of million 
the dividend was paid on april  to holders of record of loral voting and non voting common stock as of april  the dividend paid to loral s shareholders approximated the full amount of both dividend tranches received by loral from telesat 
as the dividend was paid prior to receipt of the second tranche from telesat  loral used its available cash balance to fund the difference between the loral dividend paid and the proceeds received from telesat 
on may   telesat issued  through a private placement  million of senior notes which mature on may  the senior notes are subordinated to telesat s existing and future secured indebtedness  including obligations under the telesat senior credit facilities  and are governed under the senior notes indenture 
the net proceeds of the offering  along with available cash on hand  were used to fund redemption or repurchase of all of telesat s senior notes due november  issued under an indenture dated as of june  and to pay certain financing costs and redemption premiums 
on october   telesat issued  through a private placement  an additional million of senior notes due telesat has used the net proceeds from the debt offering to fund the repayment of certain indebtedness owed to its principal shareholders  including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and for general corporate purposes 

table of contents telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations 
approximately of telesat s revenues received in canada for the year ended december   a substantial portion of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
as of december   telesat s us dollar denominated debt totaled cad billion 
as of december   a five percent increase decrease in the canadian dollar against the us dollar would have increased decreased telesat s net income by approximately cad million 
this analysis assumes all other variables  in particular interest rates  remain constant 
general subsequent to the sale  loral s remaining assets  primarily its ownership interests in telesat  will continue to have substantial value 
with the goal of maximizing shareholder value  we have previously explored  and expect in the future to continue to explore  potential strategic transactions involving telesat  including transactions that could result in public ownership of a portion of telesat 
there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms a strategic transaction involving telesat or loral may occur 
loral may  from time to time  explore and evaluate other possible strategic transactions and alliances which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  additional funds are likely to be required 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
in connection with the sale  loral has developed a plan for restructuring its corporate functions 
through mid  loral will reduce the number of employees at its headquarters 
during  loral charged approximately million to selling  general and administrative expenses  mainly for severance and related costs  and expects to make cash payments related to the restructuring primarily during and loral paid restructuring costs of approximately million during the year ended december  at december   the liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the restructuring was million which includes all expected future payments under the restructuring plan relating to the sale 
in connection with the corporate office restructuring as a result of the sale  on december   loral s board of directors approved termination of loral s supplemental retirement plan the serp 
the company expects to make lump sum payments to the participants in the serp between december  and december  in accordance with the requirements of section a of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
our unfunded benefit obligations include approximately million for future serp payments based on benefits earned as of december  in connection with the acquisition of our ownership interest in telesat in  loral has agreed that  subject to certain exceptions described in telesat s shareholders agreement  for so long as loral has an interest in telesat  it will not compete in the business of leasing  selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service  broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the c band  ku band and ka band including in each case extended band frequencies and the business of providing end to end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals  space segment  and  where appropriate  networking hubs

also during  in order to minimize our cash tax liability from the sale  we enhanced our extraterritorial income exclusion provided by former section of the internal revenue code and recorded an additional tax benefit of million 
without the sale  we would not have remeasured the extraterritorial income exclusion because it would have provided only a minimal cash tax benefit 
for and  the deferred tax provision included the impact of our equity in net income of telesat after having reversed our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents until the fourth quarter of  we had maintained a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets except with regard to the deferred tax assets related to amt credit carryforwards 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined  based on all available evidence  that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit from a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and therefore  a full valuation allowance was no longer required 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of our valuation allowance as a deferred income tax benefit to continuing operations 
as of december  and  we maintained a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets for certain tax credit and loss carryovers due to the limited carryforward periods and will continue to maintain such valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its full or partial reversal 
subsequent to the sale  to the extent that profitability from operations is not sufficient to realize the benefit from our remaining net deferred tax assets  we would generate sufficient taxable income from the appreciated value of our telesat investment  which currently has a nominal tax basis  in order to prevent federal net operating losses from expiring and realize the benefit of our remaining net deferred tax assets

following the may launch of telstar r estrela do sul  an ss l built satellite  the satellite s north solar array failed to fully deploy 
the north solar array anomaly has diminished the amount of power available for the satellite s transponders and has reduced the life expectancy of the satellite 
as a result  during the third quarter of  telesat carried out an impairment test for the satellite 
based on telesat management s best estimates and assumptions  there was no impairment in telstar r estrela do sul and as a result no adjustment to the carrying value of the asset was required 
in december  telesat received insurance proceeds of million from its insurers with respect to the claim telesat filed for the failed solar array deployment 

table of contents telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
telesat s main currency exposures as of december   lie in its us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt financing 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
as of december   telesat s us dollar denominated debt totaled cad billion 
as of december   a five percent increase decrease in the canadian dollar against the us dollar would have increased decreased telesat s net income by approximately cad million 
this analysis assumes all other variables  in particular interest rates  remain constant 
the equity losses in xtar  llc xtar  our owned joint venture  represent our share of xtar losses incurred in connection with its operations 
we regularly evaluate our investment in xtar to determine whether there has been a decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
we have performed an impairment test for our investment in xtar as of december   using the most recent forecast  and concluded that our investment in xtar was not impaired 
any further declines in xtar s projected revenues may result in a future impairment charge

it is expected that approximately of satellite services backlog will be recognized as revenue by telesat during as of december   telesat had received approximately million of customer prepayments 
critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition satellite manufacturing revenue prior to the sale is included in income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
substantially all of our satellite manufacturing revenue was associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts were recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we used this method because reasonably dependable estimates could be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates included forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties and performance incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
estimated amounts for performance incentives and penalties were included in contract value when and to the extent that it was probable such amounts would be paid or received 
performance incentives and penalties related primarily to on orbit performance of the satellite and early or late delivery of the satellite  although a limited number of contracts included performance incentives and penalties related to mass  payload performance and other items 
satellite construction contracts often include provisions for performance incentives pursuant to which a portion of the contract value typically about is at risk  over the life of the satellite typically years  contingent upon the in orbit performance of the satellite in accordance with contractual specifications 
these performance incentives are structured in two forms i under warranty payback  the customer pays the entire amount of the performance incentives during the period of satellite construction and such performance incentive amounts are subject to warranty claims  or ii under orbital receivables  the customer makes payments of performance incentives at regular intervals often monthly over the in orbit life of the satellite 
performance incentives  whether warranty payback or orbital receivables  were included in revenues during the construction period of the satellite 
the amount of performance incentives recorded as revenues was net of i a factor based on past experience to reflect the risk that a portion of the performance incentives would be lost due to non performance and ii in the case of orbital receivables  a discount for the time value of money because the amounts would be collected over the operating life of the satellite 
estimates for performance incentives and penalties were assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions were reflected when the conditions became known 
changes in estimates were typically the result of schedule changes that affected performance incentives and penalties  changes in contract scope  changes in new business forecasts that could affect the level of overhead allocated to a given contract and changes in estimates on contracts as a result of the complex nature of the satellites manufactured 
changes in estimates were included in sales and cost of sales using the cumulative catch up method  which recognizes the cumulative effect of changes in estimates on current and prior periods in the current period based on a contract s completion percentage 
provisions for losses on contracts were recorded when estimates determined that a loss would be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped were paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period resulted in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates resulted in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss 
for the years ended december   and  cumulative catch up adjustments related to prior year activity as a result of changes in contract estimates decreased increased income from discontinued operations before income taxes by million  million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share for discontinued operations by  and  respectively 

table of contents fair value measurements us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants 
us gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to observable inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets at the measurement date 
level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and pricing inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models  and similar techniques 
these provisions are applicable to all of our assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december  level level level in thousands assets cash equivalents money market funds  note receivable land note liabilities indemnifications sale of ss l the company does not have any non financial assets or non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis we review the carrying values of our equity method investments when events and circumstances warrant and consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary 
the fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available  and may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
an impairment charge would be recorded when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its current fair value and is determined to be other than temporary 

table of contents taxation loral is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
telesat is subject to tax in canada and other jurisdictions and loral will provide in operating earnings any additional us current and deferred tax required on distributions received or deemed to be received from telesat 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying anticipated statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the tax effects of an uncertain tax position utp taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to utps in income tax expense on a quarterly basis 
we recognize the benefit of a utp in the period when it is effectively settled 
previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
evaluating the technical merits of a tax position and determining the benefit to be recognized involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying such evaluation 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain a qualified pension plan and  until it was terminated in december  we maintained a supplemental retirement plan 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
the discount rate determined on this basis for the qualified pension plan and other employee postretirement benefit costs was as of december   a decrease of basis points from december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
both investment types may include alternative investments which are permitted to be up to of total plan assets 
pension plan assets are primarily managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by russell 
we also engage non russell related investment managers through russell  in its role as trustee  to invest pension plan assets 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for  and for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 

table of contents these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs included in income from continuing operations are expected to increase to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to the effect of the termination of the supplemental retirement plan 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee postretirement benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
in addition  share based payment transactions with nonemployees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument issued 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model and other models as applicable to estimate the fair value of these stock based awards 
these models require us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the models  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation we recognize 
the company estimates expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed in each reporting period and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we emerged from bankruptcy on november   and as a result  we did not have sufficient stock price history upon which to base our volatility assumption for measuring our stock based awards 
in determining the volatility used in our models  we considered the volatility of the stock prices of selected companies in the satellite industry  the nature of those companies  our emergence from bankruptcy and other factors 
we based our estimate of the average life of a stock based award using the midpoint between the vesting and expiration dates 
our risk free rate of return assumption for awards was based on term matching  nominal  monthly us treasury constant maturity rates as of the date of grant 
we assumed no dividends during the expected term 
the ss l phantom stock appreciation rights program has been designed to incentivize and reward our employees based on the increase in a synthetically determined value of ss l s equity 
as ss l s common stock has not historically been publicly traded and thus does not have a readily ascertainable market value  its equity value under the program is derived from a formula that calculates equity value based on a multiple of adjusted ebitda plus cash on hand less debt at the end of the relevant year 
each phantom stock appreciation right provides the recipient with the right to receive an amount equal to the increase in our notional stock price over the base price at the date of grant multiplied by the number of phantom stock appreciation rights vested on the applicable vesting date 
the baseline price at each grant date is updated accordingly 
the phantom stock appreciation rights have fixed exercise dates 
as such  the phantom stock appreciation rights are automatically exercised and the value if any is paid out on each vesting date 
the phantom stock appreciation rights may be settled in loral stock or cash at our option 
the number of shares of loral stock to be issued on the vesting date is determined by dividing the value of the phantom stock appreciation rights by the price per share of loral stock on the vesting date 
accordingly  the phantom stock appreciation rights are accounted for as liability awards and the value of the awards is adjusted quarterly for changes in the value of the award resulting from increases or decreases in actual or forecasted adjusted ebitda for the relevant year 
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period 
for the liability retained by loral  the ss l notional stock price was frozen as of december  in connection with the sale 

table of contents contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when  in management s opinion  such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
accounting standards issued and not yet implemented for discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented that could have an impact on us  see note to the financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources loral as described above  after the sale  loral s principal asset is a economic interest in telesat 
in addition  we have a economic interest in xtar and the land note of million 
the operations of telesat and xtar are not consolidated but are presented using the equity method of accounting 
loral has no debt 
telesat has third party debt with financial institutions 
xtar has no external debt other than to its llc member  hisdesat  for restructured lease payments on the spainsat satellite

cash is maintained at loral  telesat and xtar to support the operating needs of each respective entity 
the ability of telesat to pay dividends or certain other restricted payments as well as consulting fees in cash to loral is governed by applicable covenants relating to its debt and its shareholder agreement 
the ability of xtar to pay dividends and management fees in cash to loral is governed by its operating agreement 
cash and available credit at december   loral had million of cash and cash equivalents  a note receivable from mda for million and no debt

a more detailed discussion of these cash changes by activity is set forth in the sections  net cash used in provided by operating activities  net cash provided by used in investing activities  and net cash used in provided by financing activities 
the company does not have a credit facility 
the ss l credit facility was terminated prior to the sale of ss l to mda on november  all outstanding obligations were settled prior to termination of the facility 
cash management we have a cash management investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
our cash management investment policy establishes what we believe to be conservative guidelines relating to the investment of surplus cash 
the policy allows us to invest in commercial paper  money market funds and other similar short term investments but does not permit us to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit us to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the cash management investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all of our liquidity requirements and to provide a competitive rate of return for similar risk categories of investment 
the policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
we operate the cash management investment program under the guidelines of our investment policy and continuously monitor the investments to avoid risks 
we currently invest our cash in several liquid prime aaa money market funds 
the dispersion across funds reduces the exposure of a default at one fund 

table of contents liquidity ss l had million of cash and cash equivalents on its books at december  ss l s cash activity was reflected as a discontinued operation for pending its sale to mda on november  excluding ss l  the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  at loral  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund projected expenditures for the next months 
during  our major cash outlays will be the tax payment of approximately million associated with the gain on the sale of ss l and payments under our supplemental retirement plan of million including the final lump sum distribution resulting from termination of the plan 
other cash outlays will include additional severance payments associated with further reductions of the corporate staff  long term incentive compensation funding  the funding of employee benefit programs  funding viasat litigation costs and funding general corporate expenses 
we expect the sale will enable us to reduce the annual run rate of corporate expenses  after a transition period  to approximately million  excluding costs related to the ss l transaction and net of consulting fees from telesat of million per year 
we are also considering an additional contribution to our qualified pension plan to reduce the unfunded obligation 
offsetting these expenditures will be the receipt of cash associated with the mda land note of million 
in addition to our cash on hand  we believe that  given the substantial value of our assets  which include our economic interest in telesat and our equity interest in xtar  we have the ability  if necessary  to access the financial markets for debt or equity at the parent company 
given the continuously changing financial environment  however  there can be no assurance that loral would be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms 
risks to cash flow in the fourth quarter of  we sold our subsidiary  ss l  to mda pursuant to the purchase agreement 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we are obligated to indemnify mda for pre closing taxes  covered litigation costs and covered litigation damages as such terms are defined in the purchase agreement relating to the viasat lawsuit  subject to certain sharing formulas and caps  and certain breaches of representations  warranties and covenants  subject to certain limitations on survival of claims  deductibles and caps 
to date  other than with respect to sharing of covered litigation costs see below  mda has submitted one claim for indemnification  which relates to pre closing taxes 
we intend to vigorously contest the underlying tax assessment  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
although no assurance can be provided  we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we have reduced the gain on sale by approximately million representing the estimated fair value of all potential indemnification liabilities as of the closing date of the sale 
viasat  inc and viasat communications  inc 
formerly known as wildblue communications  inc collectively  viasat have sued ss l and loral in the united states district court for the southern district of california

viasat s amended complaint seeks  among other things  damages including treble damages with respect to the patent infringement claims in amounts to be determined at trial and to enjoin ss l and loral from further infringement of the viasat patents and breach of contract 
ss l and loral have answered viasat s complaint and asserted defenses to viasat s claims and counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that neither ss l nor loral has infringed and that they are not infringing the viasat patents  that viasat s patents are invalid and that at least certain of viasat s patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct 
ss l has also asserted counterclaims against viasat for patent infringement  alleging  among other things  that viasat infringed certain ss l patents in connection with its manufacture and sale of certain satellite communication products and services 
ss l s counterclaims seek  among other things  damages including treble damages with respect to at least one of the patent infringement claims in amounts to be determined at trial and to enjoin viasat from further infringement of the ss l patents 
in january  viasat s motion for summary judgment seeking an order declaring that the claims in two of ss l s patents are invalid was denied by the court without prejudice 

table of contents we believe that each of ss l and loral has  and we intend vigorously to pursue  meritorious defenses and counterclaims to viasat s claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that ss l s and loral s defenses and counterclaims will be successful with respect to all or some of viasat s claims or that ss l will prevail with respect to its assertion that viasat has infringed ss l patents 
we believe that ss l s and loral s conduct was consistent with  and in due regard for  any applicable and valid intellectual property rights of viasat 
although no assurance can be provided  we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  loral is obligated to indemnify ss l for all covered litigation costs and covered litigation damages as such terms are defined in the purchase agreement  subject to certain capped cost sharing by ss l  and has retained control of the defense of the lawsuit by viasat against ss l and loral as well as ss l s counterclaims against viasat in the lawsuit 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  following a change of control of loral  the liability of loral for covered litigation costs and covered litigation damages is subject to a dollar cap

affiliate matters loral has made certain investments in joint ventures in the satellite services business that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting see note to the financial statements for further information on affiliate matters 
our consolidated statements of operations reflect the effects of the following amounts in income from discontinued operations related to transactions with or investments in affiliates in millions year ended december  in millions revenues elimination of loral s proportionate share of profits relating to affiliate transactions profits relating to affiliate transactions not eliminated commitments and contingencies our business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks  the most significant of which are summarized in item a risk factors and also in note to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk loral foreign currency in the normal course of business  we are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to limit this foreign exchange rate exposure  the company seeks to denominate its contracts in us dollars 
if we are unable to enter into a contract in us dollars  we review our foreign exchange exposure and  where appropriate  derivatives are used to minimize the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to operating results and cash flows 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents interest during  our excess cash was invested in money market securities  we did not hold any other marketable securities 
derivatives as a result of the use of derivative instruments  the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counterparty credit risk  the company has a policy of entering into contracts only with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
loral had no derivative instruments as of december  telesat foreign exchange risk telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
approximately of telesat s revenues for the year ended december   a large portion of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
as of december   a five percent increase decrease in the canadian dollar against the us dollar would have increased decreased telesat s net income by approximately cad million 
this analysis assumes all other variables  in particular interest rates  remain constant 
interest rate risk telesat is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its long term debt  which is primarily variable rate financing 
changes in the interest rates could impact the amount of interest that telesat is required to pay 
derivative financial instruments telesat uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
telesat s policy is that it does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
telesat uses  as required  the following instruments forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risk on anticipated transactions  mainly related to the construction of satellites and interest payments  cross currency basis swaps to hedge the foreign currency risk on a portion of its us dollar denominated debt  and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk related to debt financing which is primarily variable rate financing
