b ebitda consists of net income attributable to capella education company minus other income expense  net plus income tax expense and plus depreciation and amortization 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities  net of any interest expense for amortization of debt issuance costs 
we use ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 
we believe ebitda presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance  because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  as it removes depreciation  amortization  interest and taxes  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to ebitda year ended december  in thousands net income attributable to capella education company other income expense  net income tax expense depreciation and amortization ebitda c free cash flow is derived by deducting capital expenditures from cash flow from operating activities as presented in the statement of cash flows under gaap 
we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
however  free cash flow is not a recognized measurement under gaap  and when analyzing our cash generating ability  investors should use free cash flow in addition to  and not as an alternative for  cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we believe free cash flow is a meaningful measure to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to assess our cash generating capabilities 
we believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives 
management uses free cash flow as an indicator of the company s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations 
cash flow from operating activities adds back non cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of cash generating capabilities as is used by management to compare our current cash generating capabilities with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview executive overview we are an online postsecondary education services company 
as of december   our wholly owned subsidiaries included the following capella university the university is a regionally accredited university offering a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs primarily for working adults 
resource development international limited rdi is an independent provider of united kingdom uk university distance learning qualifications and markets  develops and delivers these programs worldwide via its offices and partners across asia  north america  africa and europe 
sophia learning  llc sophia is a social teaching and learning platform that integrates education with technology 
we believe we have the right operating strategies in place to continually differentiate ourselves in our markets and drive growth by supporting learner success  producing affordable degrees  expanding our comprehensive marketing strategy  and serving a broader set of our learner professional needs and establishing new growth platforms 
technology and the talent of our faculty and employees enable these strategies 
we believe these strategies and enablers will allow us to continue to deliver high quality  affordable education  resulting in continued growth over the long term 
we will continue to invest in these enablers to strengthen the foundation and future of our business 
key trends  developments and challenges the following developments and trends present opportunities  challenges and risks toward achieving our goal of providing attractive returns to our shareholders initiatives to improve learner success 
as we continue to position capella to drive sustainable growth  we are focused on improving learner success rates particularly in the first four quarters of enrollment  while maintaining a high standard of academic quality and rigor 
we have implemented various measures likely to affect our growth and profitability  at least in the near term  including the following investing in our actionable analytics capabilities to further leverage data  refine our models and accurately predict the likelihood of a prospective and new learner persisting to critical thresholds of success in the learner first four quarters of enrollment  piloting programs to create personalized pathways for different learner groups which focus on transitioning learners into the online environment  creating a supportive community  and providing a proactive support structure  providing clear information near real time to our learners  faculty  advisors and staff to help learners persist and successfully complete their programs  transitioning our marketing approaches to increase emphasis on attracting learners who are more likely to persist in our programs  promoting affordability and encouraging learners to remain enrolled by offering learner success grants to new learners who meet admissions requirements  enroll  and apply within certain timeframes  and  diversifying outside of capella university by creating innovative new learning technologies that have potential to increase affordability  and better serve the life long learning needs of working adult professionals and therefore increase learner success 
as a result of these initiatives  early cohort persistence improved by approximately four percent over the prior year 
early cohort persistence measures the four quarter weighted moving average new cohort persistence rate  since that is where our learner success strategy is primarily focused 
although these early results have been positive  we expect some of these initiatives will adversely impact our new and active enrollment  revenue  and operating margins in the near term 
we believe these efforts are in the best interest of our learners and over the long term will improve learner success and lifetime revenue  which  in turn  positions us for more sustainable long term growth 
comprehensive marketing strategy 
our strategic shift from a demand driven strategy towards a comprehensive marketing strategy which is focused on building relationships with prospective learners early in the decision cycle reinforces our commitment to quality inquiries by introducing prospective learners to capella through channels such as mass media and strategic relationships with employers  connecting with prospective learners by generating and nurturing inquiries through direct media such as natural search  our website  and display media  and engaging with prospective learners by developing meaningful relationships such as through social media or direct engagement 
according to our research  we believe the awareness and consideration of capella university as an educational option has increased compared to the prior year 
this shift has also resulted in improved conversion rates of prospective learners 
however  inquiry volume has not yet fully replaced previous levels 
we believe our comprehensive marketing strategy will produce long term efficiencies and increase our ability to attract high quality learners on a long term sustainable basis 
however  some of these initiatives may adversely impact our new enrollment  revenues  and operating margins in the near term 
current market and regulatory environment 
the market continues to present challenging conditions and competition is strong  however  we remain focused on attracting the right learners and learner success 
we believe our initiatives to improve learner success through innovation will position us to be a leader in the online postsecondary education market and to more closely align with employers 
in addition  many states have become more active in regulating on line education and enforcing consumer protection laws  especially with proprietary institutions 
while we have a strong track record of regulatory compliance  such actions  even if not directed at capella university  serve to make our operating environment more challenging 
establishing new growth platforms 
we seek to drive long term growth that is an extension of our core competencies into new markets 
we are pursuing this extension through a small business development team that is exploring early stage opportunities 
this may result in increased new business development costs focused on researching  identifying  and cultivating these new opportunities 
in july  we acquired rdi to access the fast growing international higher education market 
rdi has a presence in the uk and certain other countries 
although we believe the acquisition will have a positive impact on our revenue growth  rdi was dilutive to our earnings in  and is expected to be dilutive to our earnings throughout new enrollment growth 
overall  new enrollments grew approximately percent in compared to a decline of approximately percent in new enrollment growth in the second half of was led by our master and certificate programs 
the certificate programs were designed with the intent of offering an additional credential or creating a pathway for the learner to ultimately participate in master or doctoral programs 
certificate programs are shorter in length and generate less revenue per learner than our master or doctoral programs 
thus  if these learners do not matriculate into a degree program  this may result in a lower learner lifetime value  impacting revenue and operating margins 
redesign of programs and specializations 
in our continued efforts to drive affordability and speed to competency  we are focused on maximizing efficiencies in our existing programs while delivering the same learning outcomes 
our curriculum is based on competency mappings  which we are able to leverage as we redesign existing offerings 
we believe these types of redesigns have the potential to increase persistence rates  learner success  and affordability 
regulatory environment us pending legislation and congressional hearings 
in recent years  there has been increased focus by members of the us congress on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education 
congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held  and more are expected to be held in the future  regarding various aspects of the education industry including federal financial aid and military education funding that may result in regulatory changes that affect our business 
we have voluntarily provided substantial amounts of information about our business at the request of various congressional committees and individual members  and we intend to continue being responsive to congress in this regard 
in september  the help committee held a third hearing and sen 
harkin staff released its initial report entitled  the return on the federal investment in for profit education debt without a diploma 
after additional hearings and roundtable discussions and review of the information provided by proprietary institutions  senator harkin staff released its final report in july entitled  for profit higher education the failure to safeguard the federal investment and ensure student success 
the final report was not adopted by the full committee and the minority committee staff criticized it for relying on discredited sources and refusing to examine similar concerns in the non profit education sector 
nonetheless  the report may be influential as congress begins the process of reauthorizing the higher education act  which currently expires in september the report advocates significant changes in the requirements governing participation by for profit educational institutions in title iv student financial aid programs  including the following tie access to federal aid to meeting minimum student outcome thresholds  prohibit institutions from funding marketing  advertising and recruiting activities with federal financial aid dollars  improve cohort default rate tracking by expanding the default reporting rate period beyond years  require that proprietary colleges receive at least percent of revenues from sources other than federal funds  and use criteria beyond accreditation and state authorization for determining institutions access to federal financial aid 
in addition  other congressional hearings and roundtable discussions may be held regarding various aspects of the education industry that may affect our business 
we cannot predict what legislation  if any  may emanate from these congressional committee hearings or what impact any such legislation might have on proprietary institutions and our business in particular 
congressional scrutiny of proprietary institutions combined with federal budget deficits increases the likelihood of legislation that will adversely impact our business 
as congress addresses the historic us budget deficit  whether through across the board funding reductions  sequestration or otherwise  financial aid programs are a potential target for reduction 
if congress significantly reduced the amount of available title iv program funding  we would attempt to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students  however  private sources would not be able to provide as much funding to our students on as favorable terms as is currently provided by title iv 
in addition  private organizations could require us to guarantee all or part of this assistance and we might incur other additional costs 
for these reasons  private  alternative sources of student financial aid would only partly offset the impact on our business of reduced title iv program funding 
recent legislation 
the budget control act of bca  pl eliminated the availability of subsidized stafford loans to graduate and professional students for periods of instruction beginning on or after july   and terminated the availability of certain repayment incentives for loans made on or after july  without access to subsidized loans  graduate students could see higher debt balances and subsequently higher debt payments when they graduate or leave the institution 
while difficult to determine if these changes in the law directly impacted or continue to impact enrollment  any changes to the terms by which the department makes loans available to graduate students could impact our business 
the improving transparency of education opportunities for veterans act of this veterans education initiative was signed into law on january  the purpose of the bill is to require the department of veterans affairs va to develop a comprehensive policy to improve outreach and transparency for veterans and member of the armed forces with respect to higher education 
the details of this policy will be developed through rulemaking 
additional provisions include creation of a centralized mechanism for tracking and publishing feedback from students and state authorizing agencies on the quality of instruction  recruiting practices and post graduation employment 
a description of the different types of accreditation available to institutions and an explanation of federal financial aid 
for each institution  the va will list the tax status  accreditation type  state approving agency information  if the institution participates in title iv  tuition and fees  median debt  the cohort default rate  enrollment graduation retention rate  transfer credit policies  and support services available 
the bill also contains an incentive compensation provision as it relates to va tuition benefits 
the va will not approve courses or programs for va tuition benefits if a school participates in incentive compensation practices 
rulemaking by the us department of education 
in  the doe issued new title iv program integrity rules that address numerous topics 
the most significant to our business are the following adoption of a definition of gainful employment for purposes of the requirement for title iv student financial aid that a program of study offered by a proprietary institution prepare learners for gainful employment in a recognized occupation  implementation of standards for state authorization of institutions of higher education  implementation of standards around the new program approval section of gainful employment  and expansion of the definition of misrepresentation  relating to the department authority to suspend or terminate an institution participation in title iv programs if the institution engages in substantial misrepresentation about the nature of its educational program  its financial charges  or the employability of its graduates  and expansion of the sanctions that the department may impose for engaging in a substantial misrepresentation 
the department published final regulations on october   including disclosure and reporting provisions related to gainful employment metrics 
most of the october  final rules were effective july   however  the department published final gainful employment debt and repayment metrics  and new program approval requirements on june   with an effective date of july  on june   the doe released data to educational institutions showing the calculation of gainful employment metrics for for each of the institution covered programs 
this gainful employment information was released to the public on june  an institution programs must pass a loan repayment rate test or meet debt to discretionary income or debt to annual earnings ratios in order to remain eligible for federal financial aid 
these metrics were released for informational purposes only  and as pursuant to the department final rule published in june  the standards to determine whether a program prepares students for gainful employment went into effect on july  the informational metrics for are generally based on data reported for capella university learners and programs from federal fiscal years and as a result of a data transmission issue  there is an error in the debt data that the department used to calculate capella university debt to discretionary income and debt to annual earnings ratios 
the error produced more favorable debt to earnings metrics than we had anticipated 
we thus are unable to rely on the accuracy of the informational debt to earnings metrics provided by the department and have engaged with the department on this issue 
we are not aware of any similar data issues with respect to the loan repayment rate 
six of capella university programs did not satisfy the loan repayment rate standard  of which three programs do not have a sufficient number of graduates within the pertinent timeframe to be evaluated 
the size of the remaining three programs is not material to the total number of capella university learners 
on june   one day before the regulation was scheduled to take legal effect  the us district court for the district of columbia vacated the gainful employment debt measures regulation in its entirety  largely on grounds that the loan repayment rate aspect of the regulations was arbitrary and capricious 
although the district court vacated the debt measures regulation including the loan repayment and debt to income metrics promulgated by the department to assess whether a program prepared students for gainful employment and the related institutional reporting requirements and new program approval regulations  the gainful employment program disclosure requirements that took effect july  were left intact 
on july  the department filed a motion with the district court to reinstate the requirement that institutions report information used to calculate student loan repayment rates and debt to income ratios 
the department motion is still pending 
because of the significance of this regulation  and the basis on which the district court made its decision  we believe the department may appeal the full decision to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
further  the district court found that the department did possess statutory authority to define gainful employment by regulation and to develop specific metrics as part of such regulations 
the court decision  however  means that the gainful employment debt measures regulation did not take effect on july  minnesota office of higher education student debt information request 
the minnesota office of higher education mohe is developing state level metrics related to average student loan debt 
the data request was sent to all schools located within the state 
the final report will be published by institution and sector public year  public year  private not for profit  and private for profit covering average educational loan debt excluding plus loans of degree recipients by award level for the student loan debt is debt from all sources federal  state  institution  private known to the institution 
we are working with mohe on this request 
the date for the report to be published has not been determined 
student loan cohort default rates 
to remain eligible to participate in title iv programs  an educational institution student loan cohort default rates must remain below certain specified levels 
under current regulations  an educational institution will lose its eligibility to participate in title iv programs if its two year measuring period student loan cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive cohort years  or for any given year 
capella university two year cohort default rates for the and cohorts are and  respectively 
the cohort default rate requirements were modified by the higher education opportunity act enacted in august to increase by one year the measuring period for each cohort 
starting in september  the department will publish the official three year cohort default rates in addition to the two year rates  beginning with the cohort 
if an institution three year cohort default rate exceeds for three consecutive years compared to under the current two year standard  it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate 
we believe that our current repayment management efforts meet these requirements 
if an institution three year cohort default rates for the and cohorts exceed  the institution may be subject to provisional certification imposing various additional requirements for participation in title iv programs 
beginning with the three year cohort default rate for the cohort published in september  the three year rates will be applied for purposes of measuring compliance with the requirements 
if the three year cohort default rate for the cohort exceeds  the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in title iv programs  and if the institution three year cohort default rate exceeds for three consecutive years  beginning with the cohort  the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in title iv programs 
the department has published  for informational purposes  trial rates to assist institutions in understanding the impact of the new three year cohort default rate calculation 
capella university three year cohort default rate for the cohort is  and its trial three year cohort default rate for the cohort is 
this increase is primarily due to the overall economic environment  and an increased percentage of capella university learners enrolled in a bachelor program  who generally have a higher default rate compared to graduate learners 
overview of revenues and expenses revenues 
revenues consist principally of tuition  application fees  and commissions we earn from bookstore and publication sales 
during each of   and tuition represented approximately   and of our revenues  respectively 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the number of courses per learner  iii our degree and program mix  iv the number of programs and specializations we offer  v annual tuition adjustments  vi the number of colloquia events and learners at each event  and vii the amount of scholarships  tuition discounts  and leaner success grants offered to learners 
enrollments for a particular time period are defined as the number of learners registered in a course on the last day of classes within that period 
we offer monthly start options for newly enrolled learners 
learners who start their program in the second or third month of a quarter transition to a quarterly schedule beginning in their second quarter 
enrollments are a function of the number of continuing learners at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period  which are offset by graduations  withdrawals and inactive learners during the period 
inactive learners for a particular period include learners who are not registered in a class and  therefore  are not generating revenues for that period  but who have not withdrawn from capella university 
we believe that our enrollments are influenced by the attractiveness of our program offerings and learning experience  the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting efforts  the quality of our faculty  the number of programs and specializations we offer  the availability of federal and other funding  the length of our educational programs  the seasonality of our enrollments  general economic conditions  and the regulatory environment 
the following is a summary of our capella university learners as of the last day of classes for the years ended december    and year ended december  doctoral master s bachelor s other total tuition and fees 
our tuition rates vary by type and length of program and by degree level  such as doctoral  master s or bachelor s 
for all learners in master s and bachelor s programs  tuition is charged on a per course basis 
prices per course ranged from approximately  to  for the academic year beginning in july and from  to  for the academic year beginning in july 
the price of the course varies based upon the number of credit hours  the degree level of the program and the discipline 
the majority of doctoral programs are priced at a fixed quarterly amount ranging from approximately  to  per learner for the academic year and from  to  per learner for the academic year  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
for select doctoral programs  tuition is charged on a per course basis 
prices per course ranged from  to  for the academic year and from  to  for the academic year 
other in the enrollment table above refers primarily to certificate seeking learners 
certificate programs generally consist of four courses  and the price of a course depends on the number of credit hours and the discipline 
prices per course in certificate programs generally ranged from approximately  to  for the academic year and from  to  for the academic year 
tuition increases have not historically been  and may not be in the future  consistent across our programs and specializations due to market conditions  program differentiation or changes in operating costs that have an impact on price adjustments of individual programs or specializations 
capella university implemented a weighted average tuition increase of for the academic year 
refer to the university s website  www 
capella 
edu  for tuition costs and credits required by individual degree 
these program costs will vary by learner based upon the program and specialization selected  the number of courses taken per quarter and the number of transfer credits earned at other institutions 
reductions in tuition charges from our standard rates primarily include discounts associated with military and various corporate  healthcare  federal and educational marketing relationships  along with institutional scholarships  and learner success grants 
learner success grants are generally awarded over four to eight quarters 
a large portion of our learners rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in the years ended december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues calculated on a cash basis were attributable to funds derived from title iv programs 
in addition to title iv funding  our learners receive financial aid from other governmental sources  tuition reimbursement from their employers or the department of defense or finance their education with their own funds or through private financing institutions 
reductions in tuition charges from our standard rates primarily include discounts associated with military and various corporate  healthcare  federal and educational marketing relationships  along with institutional scholarships  and learner success grants 
learner success grants are generally awarded over four to eight quarters 
operating costs and expenses 
we recently evaluated the presentation of our operating expenses and determined that additional disaggregation will provide more meaningful information and increased transparency of our operations 
the following details the additional disaggregation and a description of the costs included in our operating expense categories  including i instructional costs and services expenses  ii marketing and promotional expenses  iii admissions advisory expenses  and iv general and administrative expenses 
instructional costs and services we previously reported a portion of our admissions advisory function and an allocation of human resources costs in instructional costs and services on the consolidated statements of income 
we have disaggregated and are presenting separately admissions advisory  which is discussed in more detail below  and are including all human resources costs in general and administrative expenses 
consolidated instructional costs and services now primarily consists of compensation and costs related to the delivery and administration of our educational programs and includes costs related to faculty  learner support services  financial aid  the development of courses and programs and other related costs  associated asset impairment charges  and now includes bad debt expense 
also included are expenses related to an allocation of facility  depreciation and amortization  and information technology costs that are attributable to providing educational services to our learners 
marketing and promotional we previously reported a portion of our admissions advisory function and an allocation of human resources costs in marketing and promotional on the consolidated statements of income 
we have disaggregated and are presenting separately admissions advisory  which is discussed in more detail below  and are including all human resources costs in general and administrative expenses 
this category now primarily consists of costs related to marketing activities to build capella brand  increase awareness and consideration in prospective learners  and generate inquiries for enrollment 
these marketing activities include costs for advertising  participation in seminars and trade shows  compensation for marketing personnel and development of key marketing relationships with corporate  healthcare  armed forces  government and educational organizations 
marketing and promotional expenses also includes associated asset impairment charges  and an allocation of facility  depreciation and amortization  and information technology costs that are attributable to marketing and promotional efforts 
our marketing and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our marketing efforts  salaries and benefits for our sales personnel  brand spending  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
admissions advisory we previously reported costs related to our admissions advisory personnel in the instructional costs and services and marketing and promotional categories of the consolidated statements of income 
effective during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we began separately stating these costs on the consolidated statements of income 
we believe the disaggregation of admissions advisory expenses better represents our operations 
this category primarily consists of costs related to compensation for admissions personnel for example  enrollment services and registrar office as well as other costs directly related to the admissions advisory function 
admissions advisory expenses also include associated asset impairment charges  and an allocation of facility  depreciation and amortization  and information technology costs that are attributable to admissions advisory efforts 
general and administrative we previously reported bad debt expense and an allocation of human resources costs in the general and administrative category of the consolidated statements of income 
we are now presenting bad debt expense in instructional costs and services  and including all human resources costs in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative primarily consists of costs related to corporate costs  legal and professional fees and other related costs such as salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  new business development  finance  compliance and other corporate functions 
general and administrative expenses also include associated asset impairment charges  and an allocation of facility  depreciation and amortization  and information technology costs attributable to such functions 
we have changed our presentation of operating expenses for prior periods to conform to the above disaggregation 
there were no changes to total operating expense or operating income as a result of these changes in presentation 
the following table presents operating expenses as previously reported and as changed on the consolidated statements of income  in thousands year ended december  as reported as reclassified as reported as reclassified costs and expenses instructional costs and services marketing and promotional admissions advisory general and administrative reduction of workforce total costs and expenses other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees charged on the unused portion of the credit facility  and increases in the fair value of the rdi contingent consideration 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest consists of sophia s noncontrolling owner s portion of sophia s losses  prior to acquiring the remaining noncontrolling interest in critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  share based compensation expense  other than temporary impairments  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
tuition revenue represented approximately   and of our revenues recognized for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
course tuition revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of instruction  which is generally from one and a half to three months 
if a learner withdraws or drops a course  we follow the university refund policy  which generally is percent refund through five days  percent refund from six to twelve days  and zero percent refund for the remainder of the period 
the refund policy varies slightly for learners within certain states due to state rules or regulations 
we do not recognize revenue for learners who enroll but never engage in the courseroom 
refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the learner withdraws from a course 
if a partial refund is given to a learner in accordance with the university refund policy  the portion of the revenue which has been earned by us is recognized over the remaining period of instruction 
when we are required to return title iv funds to the department of education  the learner is not released from his or her payment obligation to the university and therefore  does not impact revenue recognition colloquia tuition revenue is recognized over the length of each colloquium  which ranges from three to days 
deferred revenue in any period represents the excess of tuition and fees received as compared to tuition and fees recognized in revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we enter into arrangements to provide program development and management consulting services to our corporate partners to establish or expand their internal employee training programs 
these arrangements often include the delivery of multiple products and services  primarily including the licensing of our learning delivery platform  hosting the training institute  providing maintenance and support  and course loading services 
we identify the elements delivered through these arrangements and allocate related fees based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue is recognized for each element in a manner consistent with the product or service delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our learners to make required payments 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts amount based on an analysis of the accounts receivable detail and historical write off experience  and current economic conditions  recoveries and trends 
in establishing our credit practices  we seek to strike an appropriate balance between prudent learner credit policies and learner retention 
accordingly  we periodically review and alter learner credit policies to achieve that objective by restricting or expanding the availability of credit we extend 
changes to credit practices may impact enrollments  revenues  accounts receivables  our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
if changes in credit practices result in higher receivable balances  if the financial condition of our learners deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be necessary  which will result in increased instructional costs and services expenses in the period such determination is made 
as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
during   and  we recognized bad debt expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
contingencies 
we accrue for costs associated with contingencies including  but not limited to  regulatory compliance and legal matters when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
we base these accruals on management s estimate of such costs  which may vary from the ultimate cost and expenses associated with any such contingency 
share based compensation 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values of the share award on the date of grant 
the fair value of our service based stock awards is estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december  expected life in years expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average fair value of options granted the expected life of our options granted during the years ended december    and is based upon our historical stock option activity 
the expected volatility assumption for the years ended december    and is based upon our own historical stock price and the expected life of the options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of regular dividend payments 
we have not historically and currently do not pay dividends 
in determining share based compensation expense  significant management judgment and assumptions are required concerning such factors as expected term  expected volatility and forfeitures 
in our opinion  the assumptions that have the most significant affect on the fair value of our service based stock options and  therefore  share based compensation expense  are the expected life and expected volatility 
the following table illustrates how changes to the black scholes option pricing model assumptions would affect the weighted average fair values as of the grant date for grants made during fiscal year expected volatility expected life years as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
marketable securities other than temporary impairments 
available for sale marketable securities are carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices or other observable inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace for identical or similar assets  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least monthly  and evaluates individual securities with fair values below amortized cost at the balance sheet date 
in order to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  management must conclude whether they intend to sell the impaired security and whether it is more likely than not that they will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if management intends to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not they will be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss or impairments on securities management has the intent to sell before recovery are recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment on debt securities related to other factors is recorded consistent with changes in the fair value of all other available for sale securities as a component of shareholders equity in other comprehensive income or loss 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value assigned to the underlying assets acquired and assumed liabilities 
at the time of an acquisition  we allocate the goodwill and related assets and liabilities to its respective reporting unit 
management identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segment constitutes businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the respective reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a two step test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of its net assets 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we completed our goodwill impairment test for the rdi reporting unit using the first day of the fourth quarter as the assessment date  and did not identify any impairment charges for the year ended december  we chose not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead performed step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test using a combination of an income based approach  and a market based approach to determine the fair value 
the income approach consisted of a discounted cash flow model that included projecting future cash flows for the rdi reporting unit  calculating a terminal value  and discounting such cash flows by a risk adjusted rate of return 
generally  the market based approach incorporates information from comparable transactions in the market and publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit to develop a multiple which is then applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit to determine value 
the determination of fair value of the rdi reporting unit consists primarily of using unobservable inputs under the fair value measurement standards 
we believe that the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of the rdi reporting unit  include  but are not limited to  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows  the discount rate applied to those cash flows  terminal growth rates  selection of comparable market multiples and applying weighting factors when a combination of valuation methods is used 
the assumptions used in determining the expected future cash flows consider various factors such as historical operating trends particularly in student enrollment  the political environment the reporting unit operates in  anticipated economic and regulatory conditions  accreditation status and reasonable expectations for planned business  and long term operating strategies and initiatives 
the discount rate is based on our assumption of a prudent investor required rate of return of assuming the risk of investing in a particular company in a specific country 
the terminal growth rate reflects the sustainable operating income a reporting unit could generate in a perpetual state as a function of revenue growth  inflation and future margin expectations 
we also believe that the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment tests are consistent with a reasonable market participant view while employing the concept of highest and best use of the asset 
finite lived intangible assets that are acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair market value on their acquisition date and are amortized on a straight line basis to reflect the economic useful life of the asset 
as of december  and  we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to the extent necessary 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our income tax expense  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for state and uk income tax purposes  respectively 
the state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through  and the uk net operating loss carryforwards do not expire 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future 
a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent we conclude a deferred tax asset is not considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during the fourth quarter of  we were no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our uk deferred tax assets would be fully realized 
therefore  during  we recorded a charge to establish a valuation allowance of million primarily related to our uk deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance charge is included in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of income 
the accounting estimate for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
a valuation allowance established or revised as a result of our assessment is recorded through income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   our net deferred tax liability was million 
the valuation allowance of million primarily relates to our uk deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized in the future 
we are subject to us federal income tax and multiple state jurisdictions  as well as uk corporation tax and hong kong profits tax 
during  the internal revenue service irs commenced an income tax audit for the tax year and an income tax audit remains open in the state of new york for tax years for us federal and uk corporation tax purposes  the statute of limitations remains open on tax years from for hong kong  the statute of limitations is years and for state purposes  the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction  but is generally from to years 
for hong kong and those states that generated net operating losses in earlier years  the statute of limitations begins to run in the year subsequent to the utilization of net operating losses 
we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as of december   we had thousand of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this total  thousand net of the federal benefit on state issues  represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
we continue to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
we recognized thousand  thousand  and million in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
in october   the statute of limitations expired on state issues related to tax year with no material impact expected on the unrecognized tax benefits 
in september and october  the statute of limitations will expire on approximately thousand in unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state issues from tax years results of operations the following selected financial data table should be referenced in connection with a review of the discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  in thousands change change of revenue vs

quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial and operating data each quarter during the years ended december  and the unaudited information reflects all adjustments  which include only normal and recurring gaap adjustments  necessary to present fairly the information shown 
first second third fourth total in thousands  except enrollment and per share data revenues operating income net income attributable to capella education company net income attributable to capella education company per common share basic diluted total enrollment revenues operating income net income attributable to capella education company net income attributable to capella education company per common share basic diluted total enrollment our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to changes in enrollment 
the capella university learner population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations and learner attrition 
the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments has typically been the greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year  which corresponds with a traditional fall school start 
the larger relative increases in enrollments in the fourth quarter have resulted in larger sequential increases in capella university revenue during the fourth quarter than in other quarters 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses does not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues  resulting in larger relative increases in operating income in the fourth quarter relative to increases between other quarters 
in addition  we typically implement tuition increases at the beginning of an academic year  which coincides with the start of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns 
in addition to our recurring seasonal patterns described above  our quarterly revenue is impacted by the timing of our colloquia tuition revenue  as evidenced in the fourth quarter of both and we typically have fourteen to sixteen colloquia per year 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during the years ended december    and primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at december  and respectively 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased primarily due to lower net income and general business activities during on september   we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na  and certain other lenders 
the credit agreement provides million of borrowing capacity  with an increase option of an additional million 
the credit agreement has a term of five years ending september  as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
significant portions of our revenues are derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements under title iv programs 
learners must apply for new loans and grants each academic year  which begins july loan funds are provided through the william d 
ford direct loan program in multiple disbursements for each academic year 
the disbursements are usually received by the beginning of the third week of the term 
these factors  together with the timing of when our learners begin their programs  affect our operating cash flow 
based on current market conditions and recent regulatory or legislative actions  we do not anticipate any significant near term disruptions in the availability of title iv funding for our learners 
on july   we acquired of the share capital of rdi for million approximately million  net of cash acquired 
in connection with the agreement  we will make an additional payment of million approximately million if rdi is granted taught degree awarding power tdap 
the timing of when rdi may be awarded tdap is dependent on approval from the british government 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe our cash provided by operations and other sources of liquidity  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we can further supplement our liquidity position with the million credit facility to fund our operations or to fund strategic investments  if needed 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income  and a decrease in cash from accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payroll  vendor invoices  and income tax payments 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income  an increase in accounts receivable due to a change in the return to title iv participation requirements  and a decrease in cash from accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to a decrease in accrued bonus expense  and the timing of payroll and vendor invoices 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities is primarily related to capital expenditures and the sale  maturity  or purchase of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of net maturities of tax exempt municipal securities  which was partially offset by cash used for capital expenditures and to acquire the remaining interest in sophia 
net maturities of marketable securities were million during the year ended december   and million during the year ended december  the maturities of marketable securities in were primarily held as cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe the credit quality and liquidity of our investment portfolio as of december  is strong 
the unrealized gains and losses of the portfolio may remain volatile as changes in the general interest rate environment and supply demand fluctuations of the securities within our portfolio impact daily market valuations 
to mitigate the risk associated with this market volatility  we deploy a relatively conservative investment strategy focused on capital preservation and liquidity 
however  even with this approach  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further due to unpredictable market developments 
in addition  these unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
capital expenditures in primarily consisted of investments in a new visitor center  foundational upgrades  data analytics  and other investments related to improving the learner experience and academic quality 
we expect our capital expenditures in will be approximately five to six percent of revenues and we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
we currently lease all of our facilities and expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million for the year ended december    and  respectively 
in  we used cash to repurchase million of common stock under our repurchase program  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash used to repurchase common stock decreased million in over  and increased million in over contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms due in each of the periods presented  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases a purchase obligations b total contractual obligations a minimum lease commitments for our headquarters  rdi s office space  miscellaneous office equipment and software license agreements 
b purchase obligations include commitments for marketing related and service contracts 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  thousand of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future borrowings associated with our credit facility  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of any commitment fees charged on the unused portion of the credit facility 
therefore  the maximum estimated commitment fee of million per annum is excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
under the terms of the rdi purchase agreement  we will make an additional payment of million approximately million if taught degree awarding powers tdap is granted to rdi 
as the timing of when rdi may be awarded tdap is dependent on approval from the british government  the contingent consideration of million is excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
the million represents the fair value of the contingent consideration and is included in other liabilities as of december  on january   rdi entered into an agreement to assign its lease in the uk to glasgow caledonian university gcu for the remainder of the lease term 
under the terms of the agreement  gcu covenants to the lessor that it will pay the remaining rents under the lease term 
however  the lessor required that rdi act as guarantor for gcu in the event gcu defaults under the lease 
the company believes default by gcu under the lease  and therefore any future payment by rdi under this arrangement  is remote 
as a result  we have excluded the arrangement from the contractual obligations table above 
regulation and oversight we are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state governmental agencies and accrediting bodies 
in particular  the higher education act hea and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the doe subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny on the basis of numerous standards that schools must satisfy to participate in title iv programs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    or there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 which is included in accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in u

the guidance was effective for the company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning january   and applied prospectively 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company financial condition  results of operations  or disclosures 
we have reviewed and considered all recent accounting pronouncements and believe there are none that could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe the risk related to cash equivalents and marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy  which focuses on capital preservation and liquidity 
in addition  all investments must have a minimum standard poor s rating of a minus or equivalent by at least one agency at the purchase date 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and december  were rated bbb or higher 
in addition  we utilize money managers who conduct initial and ongoing credit analysis on our investment portfolio to monitor and minimize the potential impact of market risk associated with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
despite the investment risk mitigation strategies we employ  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 
unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain assets in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents and marketable securities bearing a combination of fixed and variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values  or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we use the us dollar as our reporting currency 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the local currencies 
accordingly  our foreign currency exchange risk is related to the following exposures adjustments resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates 
these translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  earnings volatility translation of income and expense items of the foreign subsidiaries using an average monthly exchange rate for the respective periods  and  gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long term investment nature  as well as gains and losses from foreign currency transactions 
these items are recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
in fiscal year  we recorded thousand in net foreign currency translation losses that are included in other comprehensive income 
these losses are primarily the result of the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies during fiscal year we have not used derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
