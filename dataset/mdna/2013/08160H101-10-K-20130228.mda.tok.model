overview we are a worldwide provider of integrated electronic manufacturing services 
we provide our services to original equipment manufacturers oems of computers and related products for business enterprises  medical devices  industrial control equipment which includes equipment for the aerospace and defense industry  testing and instrumentation products  and telecommunication equipment 
the services that we provide are commonly referred to as electronics manufacturing services ems 
we offer our customers comprehensive and integrated design and manufacturing services from initial product design to volume production including direct order fulfillment and post deployment services 
our manufacturing and assembly operations include printed circuit boards and subsystem assembly  box build and systems integration  the process of integrating subsystems and  often  downloading and integrating software  to produce a fully configured product 
our precision technology manufacturing capabilities complement our proven electronic manufacturing expertise by providing further vertical integration of critical mechanical components 
these capabilities include precision machining  advanced metal joining  and functional testing for multiple industries including medical  instrumentation  aerospace and semiconductor capital equipment 
we also are able to provide specialized engineering services  including product design  printed circuit board layout  prototyping  and test development 
we believe that we have developed strengths in the manufacturing process for large  complex  high density printed circuit boards as well as the ability to manufacture high and low volume products in lower cost regions such as brazil  china  malaysia  mexico  romania and thailand 
during the past several years  we have made the necessary changes to align our business operations with our customers demand 
these changes include  among other activities  moving production between facilities  reducing staff levels  realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized million  million and million pre tax of restructuring charges  primarily related to the closure of facilities  capacity reductions and costs associated with involuntary termination of employees in connection with reductions in workforce of certain facilities worldwide 
we believe that our global manufacturing presence increases our ability to be responsive to our customers needs by providing accelerated time to market and time to volume production of high quality products 
these capabilities enable us to build stronger strategic relationships with our customers and to become a more integral part of their operations 
our customers face challenges in planning  procuring and managing their inventories efficiently due to customer demand fluctuations  product design changes  short product life cycles and component price fluctuations 
we employ production management systems to manage their procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost effective manner so that  where possible  components arrive on a just in time  as and when needed basis 
we are a significant purchaser of electronic components and other raw materials  and can capitalize on the economies of scale associated with our relationships with suppliers to negotiate price discounts  obtain components and other raw materials that are in short supply  and return excess components 
our expertise in supply chain management and our relationships with suppliers across the supply chain enables us to reduce our customers cost of goods sold and inventory exposure 
we recognize revenue from the sale of manufactured products built to customer specifications and excess inventory when title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  which generally is when the goods are shipped 
revenue from design  development and engineering services is recognized when the services are performed and collectibility is reasonably certain 
such services provided under fixed price contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment as we typically warrant workmanship only 
therefore  our warranty provisions are generally not significant 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
our procurement of materials for production requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
our gross margin for any product depends on the sales price  the proportionate mix of the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically have the potential to realize higher gross margins on products where the proportionate level of labor and manufacturing overhead is greater than that of materials 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product and higher gross margins 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
severe flooding in thailand and suspension of thailand operations our facilities in ayudhaya  thailand were flooded and remained closed from october  to december  as a result of the flooding and temporary closing of our facilities  we recognized estimated property losses of million and incurred million of flood related costs during the three months ended december  we carried property and business interruption insurance that we believe was appropriate and adequate for this situation 
our combined limit for real and personal property as well as business interruption insurance was approximately million 
as such  during the three months ended december   we recorded estimated recoveries from insurance for these property losses and flood related costs totaling million 
these estimated insurance recoveries included million of property losses from the involuntary conversion of property  plant and equipment and inventory and million of other costs directly related to the flooding in thailand 
during the year ended december   we reduced the previously estimated property losses and the corresponding estimated insurance recoveries for these property losses by million 
in addition  we received million of insurance proceeds  which exceeded our previously recorded insurance receivable by million 
the insurance proceeds included million for thailand property losses and million for other flood related costs 
as of december   we have collected our recorded insurance receivable for these property losses and flood related costs 
during the year ended december   we recognized additional thailand flood related charges totaling million  which were offset by the insurance recoveries of million in excess of previously recognized inventory and property  plant and equipment losses 
while all of these charges consist of costs directly attributable to the thailand flood which we expect to recover from our insurance  we will record additional insurance recoveries when the appropriate recognition criteria have been met 
we cannot estimate the timing of the receipt of insurance proceeds we will ultimately realize 
we do not expect to incur additional significant thailand flood related charges 
as a result of the flooding  we have been unable to renew or otherwise obtain adequate cost effective flood insurance to cover assets at our thailand facilities 
we continue to investigate all flood risk mitigation alternatives in thailand 
in the event we were to experience a significant uninsured loss in thailand or elsewhere  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ayudhaya  thailand facilities are among our largest 
as a result  the impact on revenue and operations was significant in the fourth quarter of we and our customers implemented contingency and recovery plans as a result of the flood to help enable us to meet customer needs 
as part of those plans  we restarted production at our korat  thailand facility in november  and we shifted production from our ayudhaya facilities to our various other sites around the globe 
as a result of the capital purchases associated with our contingency and recovery plans  we have incurred approximately million in capital expenditures 
summary of results sales for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion in this increase in sales was primarily due to increased demand from our existing customers  including new program wins  most notably in the computers and related products for business enterprises industry  the telecommunication equipment industry and the medical devices industry  in addition to our recovery from the thailand flooding that impacted us in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by decreased demand from customers in the testing and instrumentation products industry as a result of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry and market uncertainty in the global economy 
our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers  some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to our major customers or their products  or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services  could have an adverse effect on us 
a substantial percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers  and the loss of a major customer  if not replaced  would adversely affect us 
sales to our ten largest customers represented and of our sales in and  respectively 
in and  sales to international business machines corporation represented and  respectively  of our sales 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  from in the same period of this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales  partially driven by new programs  our continued focus on cost controls  and our recovery from the thailand flood that resulted in lower sales volume and resulting under absorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  the gross profit was impacted by million of settlement costs associated with the transfer of a major program 
we experience fluctuations in gross profit from period to period 
different programs contribute different gross profits depending on factors such as the types of services involved  location of production  size of the program  complexity of the product and level of material costs associated with the various products 
moreover  new programs can contribute relatively less to our gross profit in their early stages when manufacturing volumes are usually lower  resulting in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  a number of our new and higher volume programs remain subject to competitive constraints that could exert downward pressure on our margins 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced gross profit 
we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future 
during the year ended december   the company recognized million pre tax of restructuring charges  primarily related to capacity reduction and reductions in workforce of certain facilities worldwide  primarily in europe 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  long lived assets  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of the receivables 
to evaluate a specific customer s ability to pay  we analyze financial statements  payment history and various information or disclosures by the customer or other publicly available information 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us  we set up a specific allowance in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory obsolescence reserve we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reserve for estimated obsolescence as necessary in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demands and market conditions 
we evaluate our inventory valuation on a quarterly basis based on current and forecasted usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
customers frequently make changes to their forecasts  requiring us to make changes to our inventory purchases  commitments  and production scheduling and which may require us to cancel open purchase commitments with our vendors 
this process may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of our customers revised needs  or parts that become obsolete before use in production 
we record inventory reserves on excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are established on inventory which we have determined our customers are not responsible for or on inventory which we believe our customers will be unable to fulfill their obligation to ultimately purchase 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
during  we evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets using the criteria described above and concluded that our projected future taxable income in the us is sufficient to utilize additional net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance by million in the us and  at the same time  decreased our valuation allowance by million in foreign jurisdictions 
we are subject to examination by tax authorities for varying periods in various us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
during the course of such examinations  disputes may occur as to matters of fact and or law 
in most tax jurisdictions the passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations  thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting an examination of the tax period s for which such statute of limitations has expired 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our tax liabilities 
our subsidiary in thailand has filed for a refund of million of previously paid income taxes applicable to the years and  which is included in other assets 
the thailand tax authorities have conducted their initial examination of the applicable refund filings 
we received official notification that the tax authorities have rejected our refund claim during the fourth quarter of we have filed an appeal of the rejected refund claim as we believe that the conclusions of the thailand tax authorities are incorrect 
during  we recorded a reserve for uncertain tax benefits of million against this refund claim 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge would be recognized by the amount that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill is assessed annually for impairment  and is assessed for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment assessment  our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
as of december   and  we had goodwill associated with our asia business segment of approximately million 
beginning in  we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  or if we elect to not perform a qualitative assessment  then we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill 
this two step process involves determining the fair values of the reporting units and comparing those fair values to the carrying values  including goodwill  of the reporting unit 
based on our qualitative assessment of goodwill as of december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our asia business segment was greater than its carrying amount  and therefore no further testing was required 
we completed our annual impairment tests performed as of december  and and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
we estimated that the fair value of our asia business segment exceeded its carrying amount by approximately and  respectively  as of december  and the decrease in was primarily a result of the thailand flood 
circumstances that may lead to future impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy or other factors 
in and  we determined the fair value of our reporting units  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  based upon a combination of the income approach discounted cash flow method and market approach market comparable model methodologies 
in concluding on the fair value estimates of our reporting units in and  the income approach was given a weighting and the market approach was given a weighting based on the quality and suitability of information available in performing the income approach  relative to the market approach 
the income approach methodology utilized in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing required various judgmental assumptions about revenues  operating margins  growth rates  working capital requirements and appropriate discount rate 
in determining those judgmental assumptions  we considered a variety of data  including for each reporting unit its annual budget for the upcoming year  its longer term business plan  anticipated future cash flows  market data  and historical cash flow growth rates 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow method were i projected revenue growth over a ten year period and the annual compounded average growth rate  ii projected operating margins over a ten year period  and iii a weighted average cost of capital 
under the market approach  the value of our reporting units was estimated by comparing it to publicly traded firms in similar lines of business and geographic markets 
the market approach takes into account  among other things  the market value of total invested capital to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples of comparable companies adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects 
the selected multiples were then applied to the present value of our reporting unit s projected ebitda to arrive at an indicated range of value 
this value was then adjusted for a control premium of in and in based on a review of premiums paid for companies similar in nature to our reporting units and then adjusted for any working capital requirement excess deficit to determine a final value under the market approach 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option and the expected stock price volatility 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation could increase or decrease 
for restricted stock unit awards with performance conditions  compensation expense is based on the probability that the performance goals will be achieved  which is monitored by management throughout the requisite service period 
if it becomes probable  based on our expectation of performance during the measurement period  that more or less than the previous estimate of the awarded shares will vest  an adjustment to stock based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate

results of operations the following table presents the percentage relationship that certain items in our consolidated statements of income bear to sales for the periods indicated 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this report 
year ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges thailand flood related charges  net of insurance income from operations other expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion in the increase in sales was primarily due to increased demand from our existing customers  including new program wins  most notably in the computers and related products for business enterprises industry  telecommunication equipment industry and the medical devices industry  in addition to our recovery from the thailand flooding that impacted us in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by decreased demand from customers in the testing and instrumentation products industry as a result of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry and market uncertainty in the global economy 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our sales by industry for and computers and related products for business enterprises industrial control equipment telecommunication equipment medical devices testing and instrumentation products computers and related products for business enterprises 
sales to customers in the computers and related products for business enterprises industry for the year ended december  increased to million from million in primarily as a result of new program wins 
industrial control equipment 
sales to customers in the industrial control equipment industry for the year ended december  increased to million from million in telecommunication equipment 
sales to customers in the telecommunication equipment industry for the year ended december  increased to million from million in primarily as a result of our recovery from the thailand flooding that impacted us in the fourth quarter of as well as new program wins 
medical devices 
sales to customers in the medical devices industry for the year ended december  increased to million from million in primarily as a result of new program wins 
testing and instrumentation products 
sales to customers in the testing and instrumentation products industry for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in as a result of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry and market uncertainty in the global economy 
our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers  some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to our major customers or their products  or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services  could have an adverse effect on us 
adverse worldwide economic conditions have impacted our customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
a substantial percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers  and the loss of a major customer  if not replaced  would adversely affect us 
sales to our ten largest customers represented and of our sales in and  respectively 
in and  sales to international business machines corporation represented and  respectively  of our sales 
our international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
see item a for factors pertaining to our international sales and fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency and for further discussion of potential adverse effects in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
during and  and  respectively  of our sales were from our international operations 
we had a backlog of approximately billion at december   as compared to the year end backlog of billion 
backlog consists of purchase orders received  including  in some instances  forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts 
although we expect to fill substantially all of our backlog at december  during  we do not have long term agreements with all of our customers and customer orders can be canceled  changed or delayed by customers 
the timely replacement of canceled  changed or delayed orders with orders from new customers cannot be assured  nor can there be any assurance that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
because of these factors  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for from million in due primarily to an increase in sales 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  from in the same period of this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales  partially driven by new programs  our continued focus on cost controls  and our recovery from the thailand flood that resulted in lower sales volume and resulting under absorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  the gross profit was impacted by million of settlement costs associated with the transfer of a major program 
we experience fluctuations in gross profit from period to period 
different programs contribute different gross profits depending on factors such as the types of services involved  location of production  size of the program  complexity of the product  and level of material costs associated with the various products 
moreover  new programs can contribute relatively less to our gross profit in their early stages when manufacturing volumes are usually lower  resulting in inefficiencies and under absorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
in addition  a number of our new and higher volume programs remain subject to competitive constraints that could exert downward pressure on our margins 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher variable compensation expenses offset by reduced overhead resulting from cost controls and lower employee related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were and  respectively  for and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily associated with the impact of higher sales volumes in restructuring charges we recognized million in restructuring charges during primarily related to capacity reduction and reductions in workforce of certain facilities worldwide  primarily in europe 
the recognition of the restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with planned exit activities 
to the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
thailand flood related charges  net of insurance during  we recognized additional thailand flood related charges totaling million offset by insurance recoveries totaling million in excess of previously recognized inventory and property  plant and equipment losses 
during  we recognized million in thailand flood related charges  net of estimated insurance recoveries 
the flood related charges consist of costs directly attributable to the thailand flood  which are expected to be recovered from insurance in subsequent periods 
we will record additional insurance recoveries when the appropriate recognition criteria have been met 
we do not expect to incur significant additional thailand flood related charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense of million represented an effective tax rate of for  compared with income tax benefit of million at a negative effective tax rate of in in  we recorded a million tax expense related to changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
in  we recorded a million tax benefit as a result of a tax rate incentive received by one of our china subsidiaries during the first quarter of  a million tax benefit as a result of a decrease in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  a million tax benefit related to the settlement of income tax audits offset by a tax expense of million of additional reserves for uncertain tax benefits 
excluding these tax benefits  the effective tax rate would have been in compared to in this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the proportion of the consolidated taxable income earned in jurisdictions taxed at higher tax rates 
we have been granted certain tax incentives  including tax holidays  for our subsidiaries in china  malaysia and thailand that will expire at various dates  unless extended or otherwise renegotiated  through  and  respectively  and are subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
on january  the american taxpayer relief act atra of was signed into law 
some of the provisions were retroactive to january  had the atra had been enacted and signed prior to january  our overall tax expense would have been approximately million lower in this million tax benefit will be reflected in income tax expense in the first quarter of as a discreet event 
net income we reported net income of approximately million  or per diluted share for  compared with net income of approximately million  or per diluted share for the net increase of million in was due to the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  decreased to billion compared to billion in this decrease was primarily due to reduced demand from customers in addition to the thailand flood 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our sales by industry for and computers and related products for business enterprises industrial control equipment telecommunication equipment medical devices testing and instrumentation products during the year ended december   sales to customers in the medical devices industry  testing and instrumentation industry  computers and related products for business enterprises industry  and telecommunication equipment industry decreased   and  respectively  from these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales to customers in the industrial control equipment industry during the same period 
during and  and  respectively  of our sales were from our international operations 
we had a backlog of approximately billion at december   as compared to the year end backlog of billion 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million for from million in the impact on revenue and operations from the flooding in thailand was significant in the fourth quarter of in addition to the lower sales volume and the resulting under absorbed manufacturing overhead costs  the decrease in gross profit was also a result of million of settlement costs associated with the transfer of a major program  new program ramp costs and capacity expansion costs  primarily in asia  incurred in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to reduced stock based compensation expenses  decreased overhead resulting from cost controls and lower variable compensation expenses  which were partially offset by higher other employee related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were and  respectively  for and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due to the impact of lower sales volumes during restructuring charges we recognized million in restructuring charges during primarily related to the decision to close our dublin  ireland facility 
thailand flood related charges  net of insurance we recognized million in thailand flood related charges  net of insurance recoveries during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense benefit income tax benefit of million represented a negative effective tax rate of for  compared with income tax expense of million at an effective tax rate of for the same period in in  we recorded a million tax benefit as a result of a tax rate incentive received by one of our china subsidiaries during the first quarter of  a million tax benefit as a result of a decrease in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  a million tax benefit related to the settlement of income tax audits offset by million of additional reserves for uncertain tax benefits 
in  we recorded a million tax benefit as a result of a decrease in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in the us  and a million tax benefit as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations primarily related to an intercompany transaction between two of our subsidiaries 
excluding these tax benefits  the effective tax rate would have been in compared to in this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the proportion of the consolidated taxable income earned in jurisdictions taxed at lower tax rates  an increase in tax incentives in certain foreign jurisdictions and the reduced tax rate in china for one of our subsidiaries during see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net income we reported net income of approximately million  or per diluted share for  compared with net income of approximately million  or per diluted share for the net decrease of million in was due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our growth and operations through funds generated from operations and proceeds from the sale and maturity of our investments 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  and million at december   of which million at december  and million at december  was held outside the us in various foreign subsidiaries 
substantially all of the amounts held outside of the us are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
under current tax laws and regulations  if cash and cash equivalents held outside the us were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the cash provided by operations during consisted primarily of net income of million adjusted for million of depreciation and amortization  a million decrease in inventories  and a decrease in prepaid expense and other assets resulting from thailand flood insurance recoveries  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accounts payable 
working capital was million at december  and million at december  we experienced a strong demand pull from customers late in the fourth quarter of which reduced inventories and improved cash flows from operations 
we are continuing the practice of purchasing components only after customer orders or forecasts are received  which mitigates  but does not eliminate  the risk of loss on inventories 
supplies of electronic components and other materials used in operations are subject to industry wide shortages 
in certain instances  suppliers may allocate available quantities to us 
if shortages of these components and other material supplies used in operations occur  vendors may not ship the quantities we need for production and we may be forced to delay shipments  which would increase backorders and therefore impact cash flows 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to the purchases of additional property  plant and equipment totaling million  offset by thailand flood property insurance proceeds totaling million and proceeds from the redemptions of investments totaling million 
purchases of additional property  plant and equipment were primarily of machinery and equipment in the americas and asia 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   share repurchases totaled million and we received million from the exercise of stock options 
under the terms of a credit agreement the us credit agreement  we have a million five year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes with a maturity date of july  the us credit agreement includes an accordion feature under which total commitments under the facility may be increased by an additional million  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and lender approval 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the us credit agreement is payable quarterly  at our option  at libor plus to or a prime rate plus to  based upon our leverage ratio as specified in the us credit agreement 
a commitment fee of to per annum based upon our liquidity ratio on the unused portion of the revolving credit line is payable quarterly in arrears 
as of december  and december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and million was available for future borrowings 
the us credit agreement is secured by our domestic inventory and accounts receivable  of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the voting capital stock of each direct foreign subsidiary and substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries other tangible and intangible assets 
the us credit agreement contains customary financial covenants as to debt leverage and fixed charges  and restricts our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  repurchase shares  sell assets and merge or consolidate with other persons 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants and restrictions

our operations  and the operations of businesses we acquire  are subject to certain foreign  federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental  waste management  health and safety matters 
we believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements and we seek to ensure that newly acquired businesses comply or will comply substantially with applicable requirements 
to date  the costs of compliance and workplace and environmental remediation have not been material to us 
however  material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new  modified or more stringent requirements in the future 
in addition  our past  current and future operations  and the operations of businesses we have or may acquire  may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public  or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental  waste management or health and safety concerns

as of december   we have million remaining under the repurchase program to repurchase additional shares 
we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common shares 
management believes that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next twelve months 
management further believes that our ongoing cash flows from operations and any borrowings we may incur under our credit facilities will enable us to meet operating cash requirements in future years 
should we desire to consummate significant acquisition opportunities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facility or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable
