item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the two years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  dram and flash memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we sell products in these markets both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that assemble circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been cyclical  and have experienced periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
the global electronics market strengthened significantly in and  following the severe global recession of our results were favorably impacted as an improving economy and worldwide demand for cell phones  smart phones  laptops and other consumer electronics drove the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules  and thereby increasing demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products 
these factors coupled with new product introductions led to significantly increased sales of alignment sensors and our stand alone solder paste inspection spi and automated optical inspection aoi systems 
we successfully doubled our share of the aoi market in as our new qx aoi system was favorably received by large original design manufacturers in china  where we have an established installed base of spi systems and where the fast inspection times of the qx are required 
during the second half of  our results were impacted by an increasingly sluggish global economy and weak smt  semiconductor and solar market conditions 
these conditions caused manufacturers to delay plans for new capacity expansion the main driver of our business 
in addition  because a significant portion of the customers that use our spi and aoi systems produce laptop computers  our sales were negatively impacted in by ongoing changes in the electronics market  as consumers moved away from laptops and instead to smart phones  tablets and other mobile computing devices such as those of apple and samsung that are manufactured by companies that have not purchased our systems 
we experienced reduced year over year demand for our smt sensor and system products in backlog at december  totaled million  compared to million at the end of this year s third quarter  and million at the end of we presently believe the fourth quarter of and first quarter of should mark the low point of this market cycle 
in the third quarter of  we consolidated research and development for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis headquarters facility 
we believe this move  which resulted in a restructuring charge of  will streamline our business and provide our sensor engineers in minneapolis with more efficient access to our wafersense technology and products 
due to the consolidation initiative  we no longer manage our semiconductor operations as a separate segment  and no longer report semiconductor segment information 
this action had no impact on our global sales and service capabilities and sales of wafersense products will remain an important component of our product mix 
in addition to the semiconductor consolidation  and in response to the sluggish economy and weak smt  semiconductor and solar market conditions  we reduced our global workforce by approximately or employees during the fourth quarter of  recording severance costs of  we anticipate annual savings of approximately  resulting from consolidation of research and development for our semiconductor products and million from the fourth quarter reduction in our global workforce 
in addition  we anticipate using some of the savings to fund new investments and hire new employees to strengthen our software engineering and marketing capabilities 
despite the challenging economic and competitive environment  cyberoptics financial condition remains strong 
cash and marketable securities were million as of december   down modestly from million at december  our sizable cash position is allowing us to maintain our commitment to the development of important next generation products that  we believe  will position us to capture additional market share as the smt market rebounds 
we have restructured management in our research and development organization  earmarked expenditures to expand management and personnel in our marketing organization  and committed resources to development of products with ease of use and inspection performance that exceeds the performance of current and foreseeable competitive products 
under development is an enhanced spi system with a new user interface  as well as a new aoi system  both designed with significantly enhanced resolution required for accurately inspecting today s smallest circuit board components used in smart phones  tablets and other applications requiring higher resolution due to smaller component sizes 

table of contents we anticipate that sales will improve as progresses reflecting an improving global economy  particularly in china  an important market for our products  and that there will be a gradual rebound of solar sensor sales 
we believe the introduction of new spi and aoi offerings in will strengthen our competitive position in the market for inspection systems used to manufacture mobile computing products  new smaller personal computer products like ultra books and other similar devices 
we expect increased investment in our marketing organization and in next generation products during that will provide a path to longer term growth and stability 
our board of directors has authorized a million share repurchase program 
the common stock will be acquired from time to time in open market transactions  block purchases and other transactions complying with the securities and exchange commission s rule b we adopted a b trading plan to implement the repurchase program 
our ability to achieve our forecast and to implement our strategy effectively is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks  including the risks identified in item a of this annual report on form k 
we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful 
revenues our revenues decreased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands in thousands oem alignment sensors semiconductor sensors smt inspection systems total revenue from sales of oem alignment sensors decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in  and decreased by million or in  from million in the decrease in sales of oem alignment sensors in resulted largely from a sluggish global economy and weak smt market conditions  causing manufacturers to delay plans for new capacity expansion 
in addition  sales of solar wafer alignment cameras for the photovoltaic cell market were down million or in to  reflecting the continued impact of aggressive production capacity expansion in the solar market during and early we anticipate a gradual rebound in sales of solar and fuel cell sensors in the decrease in sales of oem alignment sensors in resulted from a challenging comparison to  when sales of capital equipment for printed circuit board production benefited from pent up demand as the global economy was emerging from the deep recession of revenue from sales of our semiconductor products decreased by  or  to million in  from million in  and increased by or million in  from million in the decrease in sales of semiconductor sensors in was driven by weak market conditions and continuing declines in sales of older wafer mapper and frame grabber products 
we anticipate that sales of these products will continue to slowly decline in the future  given that the products are mature  and any new investment is expected to be minimal 
sales of wafersense products in were roughly flat on a year over year basis at million  mainly due to weak market conditions late in the year 
revenue from sales of wafersense products increased by million  or  to million in  from million in  due to improving conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment  and increased market acceptance of our wafersense products 
revenue from sales of our smt inspection system products decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in  and increased by or million in  from million in revenue from sales of spi systems decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in  and decreased by  or in  from million in revenue from sales of aoi systems decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in and increased over in  from million in sales of aoi systems in benefited from our new qx tabletop system and qxi in line system which were introduced early in the year 
sales of these products totaled million in the decrease in sales of our smt inspection system products in was driven by a persistently sluggish global economy and weak market conditions 
in addition  because a significant portion of the customers that use our spi and aoi systems produce laptop computers  our sales were negatively impacted in by ongoing changes in the electronics market  as consumers moved away from laptops and instead to smart phones  tablets and other mobile computing devices such as those of apple and samsung that are manufactured by companies that have not purchased our systems the large increase in sales of smt inspection system products in was driven by favorable market acceptance of our new qx aoi system by large original design manufacturers in china  where we have an established installed base of spi systems  and where the fast inspection times of the qx are required  resulting in a market share increase for our aoi products in 
table of contents export revenue totaled million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in sales to international customers continue to be significant  as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
we believe that ongoing introduction of new system products will strengthen our future competitive position in the smt inspection systems market  resulting in market share increases  and that technology trends toward smaller components and increased production speeds will continue to drive demand in the future 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue decreased by million or to million in  after increasing by to million in the decrease in the cost of revenue in was due to a decline in sales 
the increase in cost of revenue in was due to a increase in sales 
items included in cost of revenue that fluctuate with the level of sales include raw materials  direct labor and factory overhead costs 
gross margin as a percentage of oem alignment and semiconductor sensor sales was in  compared to in  and in the decrease in gross margin percentage in was due largely to sluggish sales of certain higher margin smt alignment sensors  including the absence of revenues from solar wafer alignment cameras 
factory de leverage also had an impact on gross margins in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of oem alignment and semiconductor sales in was largely due to revenue increases from new higher margin products  including a increase in wafersense sales  and initial sales of our d spi sensor to german based viscom ag 
gross margin as a percentage of stand alone smt inspection systems sales was in  compared to in and in the increase in gross margin percentage in was due largely to the ongoing shift in our sales mix of stand alone smt inspection systems to higher margin qx aoi systems and away from spi systems 
our markets are highly price competitive  particularly the electronic assembly market  resulting in continual pressure on our gross margins 
we compensate for pricing pressure by introducing new products with more features and improved performance and through manufacturing cost reduction programs 
for example  our latest stand alone smt inspection system products combine a reduction in cost with enhanced performance 
other recently introduced products  including our off line and integrated in line qx and qxi aoi tabletop systems  solar wafer alignment camera  wafersense sensors and the d spi sensor we sell to viscom ag  have more favorable margins than our existing products 
operating expenses research and development expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in  and million or of revenue in the slight decrease in research and development expenses in resulted from savings of  related to the third quarter consolidation of research and development for our semiconductor products and lower project costs for proto types and consulting  offset in part by higher expenses for additional wages and benefits due to annual pay increases and headcount additions to strengthen our inspection systems product development team 
the  or increase in research and development expense in resulted from higher research and development costs in singapore due to a weaker us dollar  higher recruitment costs  along with additional wages and benefits due to annual pay increases and headcount additions  offset in part by lower project costs for proto types and consulting 
our research and development efforts in were focused on new products  including an enhanced spi system with a new user interface  as well as enhanced qx aoi systems  designed with significantly improved resolution and performance required for accurately inspecting the smallest circuit board components used in smart phones  tablets and other applications requiring higher resolution due to smaller component sizes 
other product development efforts include an spi system which will offer a increase in inspection speed for high volume production environments  along with enhancements to our off line qx tabletop aoi system and our qxi in line system 
as we complete these products and invest in next generation products  we anticipate a slight increase in research and development expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million or decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in was due to a reduction in commissions for third party sales representatives of  and a reduction in internal sales commissions and incentive bonuses of  resulting from the decline in sales  and a  reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the  or increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to additional business development activities and the impact of the weakening united states dollar on costs attributable to our foreign sales offices  offset in part by a reduction in commissions for third party sales representatives  as more sales were sold through distribution channels  and a  reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents our restructuring actions will provide annual operating expense savings of up to million  exclusive of savings that will impact cost of revenue and gross margin 
a portion of the annual savings was realized in the fourth quarter of in addition  we anticipate using some of the savings to fund additional investments and hire new employees to strengthen our software engineering and marketing capabilities 
re organization and restructure charge in the third quarter of  we consolidated research and development for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis headquarters facility  resulting in a  restructuring charge for severance and relocation expenses 
we believe this move will streamline our business and provide our sensor engineers in minneapolis with more efficient access to our wafersense technology and products 
we anticipate annual savings of up to  resulting from consolidation of research and development for our semiconductor products 
additional severance costs of  were incurred in the fourth quarter of when we reduced our global workforce by approximately or employees in response to the sluggish economy and weak smt  semiconductor and solar market conditions 
we anticipate annual savings of up to million from the fourth quarter workforce reduction 
no restructuring or severance costs were incurred in a summary of our restructuring accrual follows in thousands semiconductor r d consolidation fourth quarter workforce reduction total balance  january  cost incurred payments made balance  december  the remaining accrued severance in the amount of  at december  will be paid prior to july  interest income and other interest income and other includes interest earned on investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
interest income and other decreased in and  due to smaller gains resulting from foreign currency transactions and lower interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on invested funds 
in  we also recognized a  permanent impairment loss on our investment in an equity security 
fluctuations in the level of gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange forward contracts impact the level of interest income and other reported in any given period 
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses  net of underlying currency hedges of  in  compared to foreign currency transaction gains  net of underlying currency hedges of  in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of a negative 
even though we incurred a loss in  we still recorded income tax expense and our effective tax rate was negatively impacted  because we concluded that a million non cash charge was needed to record a valuation allowance against substantially all of our united states and singapore based deferred tax assets due to the decline in our level of profitability and near term financial outlook 
the valuation allowance may be reversed once our operations and outlook materially strengthen 
we recorded income tax expense of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate for reflects the benefit of having a significant portion of our operations in singapore where corporate income tax rates are substantially lower than the united states 
lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions favorably impacted our income tax rate by 
other items favorably impacting our income tax rate in include benefits from the federal research and experimentation r d tax credit and the domestic manufacturer s production incentive deduction 
an increase in our valuation allowance for state r d tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards negatively impacted our effective tax rate by in 
table of contents we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
during  the internal revenue service completed an audit of our federal income tax return 
the audit resulted in no change to our reported level of taxable income or income tax liability  and had no impact on our financial condition 
due to the carryback of our federal taxable loss to the years  the internal revenue service could potentially examine our federal income tax returns for those years 
the statute of limitations for examination of these returns had previously expired 
we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in due to use of cash for investing activities  including purchases of marketable securities  net of maturities and sales  of million  and equipment purchases of million  offset in part by proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of  our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
combined balances of cash and marketable securities decreased to million as of december   from million as of december  operations provided virtually no cash in  reflecting our net loss of million  offset in part by non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred income taxes  non cash gains from foreign currency transactions  unrealized loss on available for sale equity security and stock compensation costs 
deferred income tax expense of million resulting from the valuation allowance we recorded in was the largest component of total non cash expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included decreases in accounts receivable of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in inventory of million  increases in refundable income taxes of million  decreases in accounts payable of million  decreases in advance customer payments of  and decreases in accrued expenses of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable and advance customer payments resulted from substantially lower sales levels and activity in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of inventories have increased as sales levels have been lower than anticipated 
higher income tax refunds receivable are due to income tax payments made in and an increase in refundable income taxes resulting from our loss in accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased due to lower commission and incentive compensation accruals  resulting from lower levels of revenue and profitability  and payment of incentive compensation accruals in the decrease in accounts payable resulted from a significant reduction in new raw material purchases as we work to reduce inventory levels resulting from lower than anticipated sales in operating activities provided million of cash in cash provided by operations included net income of million  which included non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and stock compensation expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included decreases in inventory of million and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in accounts receivable of  and decreases in accounts payable of million 
better sales forecasting and inventory management resulted in lower inventory purchases in the latter half of and a corresponding reduction in inventory and accounts payable levels 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased due to higher warranty  commission and incentive compensation accruals  resulting from higher sales levels and improved operating results 
accounts receivable were higher due to a slight slowdown in our collection efficiency 
investing activities used million of cash in  compared to using million of cash in changes in the level of investment in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases  sales and maturities of those securities  used million of cash in and used million of cash in we used million of cash in and  of cash in for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
the increase in fixed asset purchases in was due to new network storage equipment  office improvements and research and development test equipment 
financing activities provided  of cash in  compared to providing  of cash in cash from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan totaled  in and  in common stock repurchases totaled  in at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  purchase commitments for inventory can vary based on the volume of revenue and resulting inventory requirements 
while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our board of directors has authorized a million share repurchase program 
the common stock will be acquired from time to time in open market transactions  block purchases and other transactions complying with the securities and exchange commission s rule b we adopted a b trading plan to implement the repurchase program 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed above 
related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the two year period ended december  inflation and foreign currency transactions changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength or weakness of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
most of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
we manufacture our smt system products in singapore and a portion of our raw material purchases are denominated in singapore dollars 
we also have r d and sales personnel located in singapore and sales offices located in other parts of the world 
although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue  they can impact our costs and influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is months and  accordingly  at december   all of our open foreign exchange forward contracts had maturities of one year or less 
the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of our foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges at december  was approximately million 
at december   our open foreign exchange forward contracts were in an unrealized gain position equal to  on a pre tax basis due to a significant weakening of the us dollar in relation to the singapore dollar in if the exchange rate between the us dollar and the singapore dollar were to remain unchanged over the next twelve months  we would realize this gain through our statement of operations 
however  because we do not fully hedge all of our future anticipated cash flows in singapore dollars  the portion of our costs that we do not hedge would be higher in relation to recent quarters 
if the us dollar were to strengthen in future periods in relation to the singapore dollar  the unrealized gain on our open foreign exchange forward contracts would be reduced  but costs that are not hedged would decrease 
the ultimate impact of any fluctuation in the relationship between the us dollar and singapore dollar is dependent on the level of singapore denominated cash flows in future periods and our hedging activity 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
under the amended guidance  all changes in oci are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the fasb subsequently met on october  and decided that the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred 
we adopted the remaining amended disclosure requirements effective january  our adoption of the amended disclosure requirements had no impact on our consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for amounts classified out of other comprehensive income to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amended guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  there will be no impact to the consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms  and include shipping and handling costs 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt system products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
our multiple deliverable arrangements typically include the sale of an smt inspection system  installation and training  and in some cases  an extended warranty 
revenue from installation and training are recognized as the services are provided 
revenue from extended warranties are recognized ratably over the warranty period 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element at inception of an arrangement using the relative selling price method 
selling price is determined based on a selling price hierarchy  consisting of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence or estimated selling price 
management s best estimate of the selling price of an smt machine is based on the cost build up of the product and a reasonable margin based on geographic location and market conditions 
we use vsoe to establish fair value for extended warranty  installation and training services 
if vsoe is not available to establish fair value for extended warranty  installation and training services  we estimate a selling price based on the cost build up for the particular service and a reasonable gross margin 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  at december  and  at december  
table of contents allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties was  at december  and  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we formulate our assumptions regarding future demand and market conditions based on order trends and input from customers regarding their future requirements 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of  at december  and  at december  valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
for goodwill  if the carrying value of our net assets net book value exceeds fair value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill by estimating our fair value utilizing the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
when considering fair value  we also gave consideration to the control premium in excess of our current market capitalization that might be obtained from a third party acquirer 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
at december  and we have remaining goodwill equal to  our recent analyses performed in and indicate that this goodwill is not impaired 
however  our conclusion could change in the future  if our assumptions about future economic conditions  revenue growth or profitability change 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the future 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not threshold ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent 
the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
de recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 

table of contents as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and us gaap income  research and development tax credit carry forwards and federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards or credits are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards 
significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
at december   we concluded that a valuation allowance is needed for substantially all of our united states and singapore based deferred tax assets due to the decline in our level of profitability and near term financial outlook 
in analyzing the need for a valuation allowance  we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions where we operate  our financial performance in recent quarters  statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
finally  we considered both our near and long term financial outlook and timing regarding when we might return to profitability 
after considering all available evidence both positive and negative  we concluded that a valuation allowance of million is required for substantially all of our us and singapore based deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  of  was needed for various long term state tax credit carry forwards  state operating loss carry forwards and capital losses for which recovery was not deemed to be more likely than not 
deferred tax assets at december   include  for net operating loss carry forwards incurred in the uk by cyberoptics ltd  which was acquired in a valuation allowance has not been recorded against these deferred tax assets 
the utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on cyberoptics ltd 
s ability to generate sufficient uk taxable income during the carry forward period 
derivatives and hedging 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the accompanying balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
the maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is months 
accordingly  at december  and december   all of our open foreign exchange forward contracts had maturities of one year or less 
the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of our foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was approximately million at december  and million at december  we estimate hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis by considering the difference between the prices of a hypothetical forward contract maturing on the last day of a given month  to the prices of a series of hypothetically perfect daily forward contracts 
hedge ineffectiveness and the amounts excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in earnings on cash flow hedges were not material for the years ended december  and at december   the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts representing a gain in the amount of  was recorded in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
