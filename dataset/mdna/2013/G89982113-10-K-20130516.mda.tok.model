index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition  exploration  development and production 
we have focused our operations in countries that have established  yet underexplored  petroleum systems  have stable governments  are net importers of petroleum  have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing  royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies 
as of december   we held interests in approximately million net onshore and offshore acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in turkey  bulgaria and romania 
as of may   approximately of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by n 
malone mitchell  rd  the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer 
financial and operational performance during  we derived of our oil and natural gas sales revenues from the production of oil and from the production of natural gas 
total oil and natural gas sales revenues increased to million for from million realized in  excluding sales of purchased natural gas 
the increase was primarily the result of a per boe increase in the average price received and a mbbl increase in oil production 
production increased to net mbbl of oil and decreased to  net mmcf of natural gas for  compared to net mbbl of oil and  net mmcf of natural gas for in  we incurred million in capital expenditures  including acquisition costs  compared to capital expenditures of million in the decrease is primarily due to the acquisitions of tbng  direct bulgaria  direct petroleum morocco  inc direct morocco and anschutz morocco corporation anschutz in during  we repaid all of our short term borrowings  compared to short term borrowings of million in at december   our debt outstanding was million  all of which was long term 
our net loss from continuing operations for was million  resulting primarily from million of exploration  abandonment and impairment of certain proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties

index to financial statements critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
our significant accounting policies are described in note significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas properties 
in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties  costs of productive wells  developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities 
acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using the unit of production method based on total proved reserves  and exploration well costs and additional development costs are amortized using the unit of production method based on proved developed reserves 
proceeds from the sale of properties are credited to property costs  and a gain or loss is recognized when a significant portion of an amortization base is sold or abandoned 
exploration costs  such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and exploration overhead  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs  including the cost of stratigraphic test wells  are initially capitalized but charged to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be non productive 
the determination of an exploratory well s ability to produce must be made within one year from the completion of drilling activities 
the acquisition costs of unproved acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost  net of accumulated impairment provisions  until such leases are transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of unproved properties 
impairment of long lived assets 
we follow the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment asc 
asc requires that our long lived assets be assessed for potential impairment of their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred 
oil and natural gas properties are evaluated by field for potential impairment 
other properties are evaluated for impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets as applicable 
an impairment on proved properties is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of an asset are less than its carrying value 
if an impairment occurs  the carrying value of the impaired asset is reduced to its estimated fair value  which is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
unproved oil and natural gas properties do not have producing properties and are valued on acquisition by an independent expert 
as reserves are proved through the successful completion of exploratory wells  the cost is transferred to proved properties 
the cost of the remaining unproved basis is periodically evaluated by management to assess whether the value of a property has diminished 
to do this assessment  management considers i estimated potential reserves and future net revenues from an independent expert  ii the company s history in exploring the area  iii the company s future drilling plans per its capital drilling program prepared by the company s reservoir engineers and iv operations management and other factors associated with the area 
impairment is taken on the unproved property cost if it is determined that the costs are not likely to be recoverable 
the valuation is subjective and requires management to make estimates and assumptions which  with the passage of time  may prove to be materially different from actual results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements business combinations 
we follow asc  business combinations asc  and asc  consolidation asc 
asc requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at fair value 
the statement applies to all business combinations  including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone 
under asc  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
accordingly  transactions costs related to acquisitions are to be recorded as a reduction of earnings in the period they are incurred and costs related to issuing debt or equity securities that are related to the transaction will continue to be recognized in accordance with other applicable rules under us gaap 
asc requires non controlling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity 
the statement applies to the accounting for non controlling interests and transactions with non controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency translation 
we follow asc  foreign currency matters asc 
asc requires the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation 
exchange gains or losses from re measuring transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency are included in earnings 
for certain of our controlled entities  translation adjustments result from the process of translating the functional currency of subsidiary financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency 
these translation adjustments are reported separately and accumulated in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the accounting basis of the assets and liabilities affected by the change are adjusted to reflect the difference between the exchange rate when the asset or liability arose and the exchange rate on the date of the change 
other recent accounting pronouncements and reporting rules in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value  as well as similar disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles  clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the asc disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted asu on january  the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu 
asu deferred the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
the amendments became effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we adopted asu on january  the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment asu 
asu allows both public and nonpublic entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted asu on january  the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements

index to financial statements in december  fasb issued asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
asu requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
application of asu will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  fasb issued asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
the update provides an entity with the option first to assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
after assessing the qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption was permitted 
we did not early adopt the provisions of asu we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  fasb issued asu  new disclosures for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income to be presented in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented or in the footnotes to the financial statements 
additionally  the amendment requires cross referencing to other disclosures currently required for other reclassification items 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
we have reviewed other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future earnings or operations

such translation adjustments accumulate on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as foreign currency translation adjustments 
as of december  and december   we had losses of million and million  respectively  in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of translation adjustments 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a gain of million and a loss of million  respectively  of foreign currency translation adjustments 
we are also subject to foreign currency exposures as a result of our operations in the other foreign countries in which we operate and foreign currency fluctuations as oil prices received are referenced in us dollar denominated prices 
we record foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as a component of other expense income for gains and losses which result from re measuring transactions and monetary accounts into our functional currency in earnings 
as of december   we had million try approximately million in cash and cash equivalents that are remeasured into our

for and  we recorded a foreign exchange gain of million and a foreign exchange loss of million  respectively 
we estimate that a change in the exchange rates would impact such cash balances and our net loss by approximately million 
we have not used foreign currency forward contracts to manage exchange rate fluctuations 
commodity price risk our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas 
the prices for oil and natural gas are extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supplies  weather conditions  economic conditions and government actions 
pursuant to our amended and restated credit facility  at least one of the borrowers is required to maintain commodity derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas 
as a result  temi has entered into costless collar and three way collar derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas to hedge the price of oil 
pursuant to our amended and restated credit facility  we cannot enter into hedge agreements that  when aggregated with any other hydrocarbon hedge agreement then in effect  covers notional volumes in excess of of the reasonably projected production volumes attributable to our proved developed reserves 
the derivative contracts economically hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil production 
while the use of the hedging arrangements will limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
the costless collars provide us with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price we will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price we will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly 
these contracts may or may not involve payment or receipt of cash at inception  depending on the ceiling and floor pricing 
the three way collar contracts consist of a purchased put  a sold call and a purchased call 
the purchased put establishes a lower limit floor price  the sold call establishes an upper limit ceiling price and the purchased call establishes a second floor price on the hedged volumes 
the three way collar contracts require our counterparty to pay us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price 
we are required to pay our counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price but below the second floor price  and our counterparty is required to pay us if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the second floor price 
neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price 
the three way collar contracts are settled monthly 
we have elected not to designate our derivative financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes  and accordingly  we record such contracts at fair value and recognize changes in such fair value in current earnings as they occur 
our commodity derivative contracts are carried at their fair value in earnings as they occur 
we recognize unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts on a mark to market basis in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss under the caption loss on commodity derivative contracts 
settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
if commodity prices decrease  this commodity price change could have a positive impact to our earnings 
conversely  if commodity prices increase  this commodity price change could have a negative effect on our earnings 
each derivative contract is evaluated separately to determine its own fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net unrealized loss on commodity derivative contracts of million 
we recorded a net unrealized loss on commodity derivative contracts of million in
