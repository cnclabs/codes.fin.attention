executive overview we are a global provider of business process  information technology it and professional services that are focused on digital enablement 
we operate in two reporting segment content services cs and innodata advanced data solutions iads 
the following table sets forth  for the period indicated  certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december  dollars in millions years ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue revenues direct operating costs selling and administrative expenses impairment charge income loss from operations other income income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss loss attributable to non controlling interest net income loss attributable to innodata inc and subsidiaries revenues we price our services based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized  and we recognize revenue in the period in which the services are performed and delivered 
revenues for contracts billed on a time and materials basis are recognized as services are performed 
revenues under fixed fee contracts  which are not significant to the overall revenues  are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  as services are performed or milestones are achieved 
we formed our iads segment in mid to design and develop new capabilities to enable clients in the financial services  insurance  medical and healthcare sectors to improve decision support through digital technologies 
iads operates through two subsidiaries synodex and docgenix 
synodex offers a range of data analysis services in the healthcare  medical and insurance areas 
docgenix provides services to financial services institutions 
as of december   we own of synodex  a limited liability company  and of docgenix  a limited liability company 
the subsidiaries are at an early stage of development  and reported minimal revenues in there were no revenues in our top two clients generated approximately  and of the company s total revenues in the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
another client accounted for less than of our total revenues for the year ended december   but for and of our total revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively 
one other client accounted for less than of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  but for of our total revenues for the year ended december  no other client accounted for or more of revenues during these periods 
further  in the years ended december   and  revenues from non us clients accounted for  and  respectively  of the company revenues 
we may lose any of these  or our other major clients  as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our clients requirements  the completion or termination of a project or engagement  or the client s selection of another service provider 
we may also experience significant volume fluctuation 
our services are typically subject to client requirements  and in many cases are terminable upon to days notice 
direct operating costs direct operating costs consist of direct payroll  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  travel  telecommunications  computer services and supplies  realized gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency forward contracts and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses consist of management and administrative salaries and incentives  sales and marketing costs  new services research and related software development  professional fees and consultant costs and other administrative overhead costs 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues total revenues were million for the year ended december   a increase from the million for the year ended december  revenues from the content services segment were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from the iads segment were million for the year ended december  there were no revenues from the iads segment for the year ended december  the million increase in the content services segment is principally attributable to higher revenues from e book related services that we performed for one of our significant clients 
we experienced sequential declines in revenue from this client in the last three quarters of our top two clients generated million or and million or of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
another client accounted for less than of our total revenues for the year ended december   but for of our total revenues for the year ended december  no other client accounted for or more of revenues during these periods 
further  in the years ended december  and  revenues from non us clients accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
direct operating costs direct operating costs were approximately million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million or approximately 
direct operating costs for the content services segment were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million or approximately 
direct operating costs for the iads segment were approximately million and million for the respective periods  net of intersegment profits 
the increase in direct operating costs for the content services segment was principally attributable to an increase in production headcount and other operating costs in support of increased revenues 
the increase in direct operating costs was partially offset by a decrease in direct labor costs achieved primarily from productivity gains 
the productivity gains were principally the result of increased efficiency  improvements in our processes and innovation in our technology 
the increase in direct operating costs for the iads segment represents production costs for initial engagements  increase in production labor costs to perform pilot engagements and facility overhead costs for our new delivery center in asia 
direct operating costs as a percentage of total revenues declined to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  direct operating costs for the content services segment as a percentage of content services segment revenues were approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million  or approximately 
selling and administrative costs for the content services segment were million and million in these respective periods 
selling and administrative expenses for the iads segment for the respective periods were million and million  net of intersegment profits 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses for the content services segment for the year ended december  is principally attributable to compensation costs of new hires  wage increases and an increase in other miscellaneous administrative costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million from the recovery of bad debts from a previously fully reserved account receivable 
selling and administrative expenses for the content services segment  as a percentage of content services segment revenues  declined to for the year ended december   from for the year ended  and this was primarily as a result of higher revenues 
the million increase in selling and administrative expenses for the iads segment is primarily attributable to compensation costs of new personnel hired for sales and marketing and increases in other administrative costs 
impairment charge docgenix provided services to three clients in and we expect to continue to provide services to some of these clients in the existing docgenix product and service offering did not gain traction in the market place beyond its initial clients 
in order to reach a broader market we will need to revise our approach from that represented by the existing product and service 
as a result in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the carrying value of the fixed assets of our docgenix subsidiary compared to its fair value and concluded that the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
this resulted in an impairment charge of million 
restructuring costs in the second half of  we restructured our operations  and recorded a one time charge of approximately million million in direct operating costs and million in selling  general and administrative costs representing severance and other personnel related expenses 
we expect cost savings of approximately million per year from this restructuring activity 
income taxes for the year ended december   our us entity recorded a benefit from income tax on account of losses incurred by our us entity 
with respect to our foreign subsidiaries  we recorded a provision for income taxes in accordance with the local tax regulations 
as some of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax holidays or preferential tax rates  our overall effective tax rate was lower compared to the us statutory tax rate 
in addition  the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to tax in the us unless the earnings are repatriated 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes for the us entity and certain  but not all of our foreign subsidiaries  as certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax holidays or preferential tax rates 
in addition  the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to tax in the us unless the earnings are repatriated 
the effective tax rate at was lower for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  as the income attributable to our higher tax jurisdictions was lower 
beginning in  unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on distribution to the united states  because such earnings are not anticipated to be remitted to the united states 
if such earnings were to be distributed  we could be subject to united states income taxes that may not be fully offset by foreign tax credits 
determination at this time  of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings  expectation of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
at december  and  we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
pursuant to an income tax audit by the indian bureau of taxation in march  one of our indian subsidiaries received a tax assessment approximating  including interest  through december   for the fiscal tax year ended march  we disagree with the basis of the tax assessment and filed an appeal with the appeal officer against the assessment 
in october  the matter was resolved with a judgment in our favor 
under the indian income tax act  however  the income tax assessing officer has a right to appeal against the judgment passed by the appeal officer 
in december  the income tax assessing officer exercised this right  against which we filed an application to defend the case and we intend to contest it vigorously 
the indian bureau of taxation has also completed an audit of our indian subsidiary s income tax return for the fiscal tax year ended march  the ultimate outcome was favorable  and there was no tax assessment imposed for the fiscal tax year ended march  in and  the indian subsidiary received a final tax assessment for the fiscal years ended march  and from the indian bureau of taxation 
the tax assessment amounted to  and  including interest through december   for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we disagree with the basis of these tax assessments  have filed an appeal against the assessments  and we intend to contest the assessment vigorously 
in january  the indian subsidiary received a final tax assessment approximately million  including interest  for the fiscal year ended march  from the indian bureau of taxation 
we disagree with the basis of this tax assessment  and have filed an appeal against the assessment 
due to this assessment  we recorded a tax provision amounting to  including interest through december  based on recent experience and the current development  we believe that the tax provision of  including interest is adequate 
the indian bureau of taxation commenced an audit of this subsidiary s income tax return for the fiscal year ended march  the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time 
as we are continually subject to tax audits by the indian bureau of taxation  we have assessed the likelihood of an unfavorable assessment for all fiscal years where we are not subject to a final tax assessment as of december   and have recorded an additional tax provision amounting to approximately million including interest through december  in january  one of our philippine subsidiaries received an informal tax assessment for an amount totaling million for the year ended december  although  we have not yet received formal notice of this assessment  we have had a discussion with the tax examiner 
based on this discussion  we believe that it is reasonably likely that we will be successful in contesting the assessment 
accordingly  we recorded no tax provision on said informal tax assessment 
in addition  we will continuously monitor the outcome and will record an appropriate tax provision in the event there is any change in circumstances 
we had unrecognized tax benefits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the portion of unrecognized tax benefits relating to interest and penalties was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and  if recognized  would have an impact on our effective tax rate 
we are subject to various tax audits and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business 
management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these audits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
net income we generated net income of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  net income for the content services segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the significant increase in net income for the content services segment was primarily due to an increase in gross margins resulting from higher revenues  and an increase in productivity due to improvements in processes and technology 
this increase was partly offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses primarily due to compensation costs of new hires  wage increases and an increase in other administrative costs 
a lower provision for income taxes and higher losses attributable to non controlling interests in the year ended december  compared to year ended december  also contributed to an increase in net income 
net loss for the iads segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   net of intersegment profits 
the increase in net loss was principally on account of new personnel hired for operations  and sales and marketing  increase in facility overhead costs and other administrative costs  and a million impairment charge for our docgenix subsidiary 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or approximately 
the million increase in revenues is principally attributable to higher revenues from our e book related services that we perform for one of our larger clients and revenue from analytics services that we perform for a major accounting firm 
our top three clients generated million or and million or of our revenues in the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
another client accounted for less than of our revenues for the year ended december   and for million or of our revenues for the year ended december  no other client accounted for or more of our total revenues in either period 
further  for the years ended december  and  revenues from clients located in foreign countries principally in europe amounted to million or and million or  respectively  of our total revenues 
there were no revenues for the year ended december  from our recently formed iads segment 
direct operating costs direct operating costs were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million or approximately 
the increase in direct operating costs was attributable to an increase in production headcount and other operating costs in support of increased revenues 
in addition  direct operating costs increased on account of foreign exchange rate fluctuations caused by a strengthening of the philippine peso and indian rupee against the us dollar 
the us dollar depreciated against the asian currencies in the first three quarters of  however  it surged significantly in the fourth quarter of this resulted in a net loss on the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts in the fourth quarter of the realized gain on the settlement of forward contracts in was million as compared to million in the increase in direct operating costs was partially offset by a decrease in direct labor costs achieved primarily from productivity gains 
the productivity gains were principally the result of increased efficiency  improvements in our processes and innovation in our technology 
included in total direct operating costs is approximately million in start up costs that we incurred for the iads segment during the year ended december  the changes in revenues and direct operating expenses mentioned above resulted in a decline in direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  excluding the start up costs incurred for the iads segment from the total direct operating costs  direct operating costs would have increased by approximately in as compared to and  as a percentage of revenues  would have been in  compared to in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million or 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase in selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is principally attributable to compensation costs of new personnel hired for sales and marketing  severance costs of million  increases in variable employee incentives and million on account of our continued investments for the iads segment  which includes approximately million incurred towards professional fees for creating best in class information and a data security environment for the iads segment 
excluding the million start up costs incurred for the iads segment  selling and administrative expenses would have increased by approximately in as compared to and  as a percentage of revenues  would have been approximately in  compared to in income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes primarily for our foreign subsidiaries  which was partially offset by a tax benefit recorded for the us entity 
the benefit from income tax recorded by the us entity resulted from losses incurred by the us entity during the year ended december  these losses were incurred primarily on account of start up costs incurred for the iads segment  with no associated revenue in certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries are subject to preferential tax rates 
in addition  one of the foreign subsidiaries enjoys a tax holiday 
due to the tax holiday and the preferential tax rates  the income tax rate for the company was substantially reduced 
certain overseas income is not subject to tax in the us unless repatriated 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes primarily for our foreign subsidiaries  which was more than offset by the benefit recorded for the us entity 
the benefit from income tax recorded by the us entity resulted primarily from losses incurred by the us entity during the year ended december  one of our foreign subsidiaries enjoyed a tax holiday in in addition  certain of our foreign subsidiaries enjoy preferential tax rates 
certain overseas income is not subject to tax in the us unless repatriated 
net income loss we generated net income of million in compared with a net loss of million in the change was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margins resulting from an increase in revenues  and an increase in productivity due to improvements in processes and technology 
this increase was partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates  an increase in selling and administrative expenses primarily due to hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  and an increase in variable employee incentives  and start up costs incurred for the iads segment amounting to million 
the change in net income also reflects an increase in interest income and an increase in the tax provision in compared to a tax benefit recorded in liquidity and capital resources selected measures of liquidity and capital resources  expressed in thousands  are as follows december  cash and cash equivalents    short term investments    working capital    at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  of which million was held by our foreign subsidiaries  and short term investments of million which was entirely held by our operating foreign subsidiaries located in asia 
a significant portion of the amounts held outside of the unites states could be repatriated to the united states  but under current law  would be subject to unites states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credit 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the unites states 
we have used  and plan to use  our existing cash for i expansion of existing operations  ii general corporate purposes  including working capital  iii possible business acquisitions  and iv continuing investments in iads 
as of december   we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately million compared to working capital of approximately million at december  we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues

adjustments for non cash items principally consisted of million for depreciation and amortization  stock compensation expense of million  million for a net change in deferred taxes and million for pension costs 
working capital activities primarily consisted of a use of cash of million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable and a use of cash of million for an increase in other assets  partially offset by a source of cash of million for accrued salaries and wages representing payroll and incentive accruals and a source of cash amounting to million for an increase in accounts payable 
cash provided by our operating activities in was million  resulting from a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of million  and million provided from working capital

working capital activities primarily consisted of a source of cash of million as a result of net collections on accounts receivable  a use of cash of million for an increase in other assets  a use of cash amounting to million for a decline in accounts payable  and a source of cash of million for income and other taxes 
at december   our days sales outstanding were approximately days as compared to days as of december  and days as of december  the increase in our days sales outstanding is primarily on account of a significant growth in revenue from one of our large clients 
this client is a large company with a strong balance sheet 
net cash provided by used in investing activities during  and  cash used in our investing activities for capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
capital spending in for content services segment was million that principally consisted of purchases of technology equipment  including workstations  computer software and leasehold improvements  and to establish a new delivery center in asia

during  we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology  equipment  infrastructure upgrades  development of proprietary software platform  tools and technologies for both cs and iads will approximate to million  a portion of which we may finance 
also  included in the investing activities during the year ended december  and is the sale of short term and long term investments primarily representing proceeds on the maturity of certificates of deposit in amounts of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we purchased short term and long term investments consisting of million of certificates of deposit 
net cash provided by used in financing activities payment of long term obligations approximated million  million and million for  and  respectively 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options for the year ended december  were million 
there were no stock option exercises during the years ended december  and in june  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
in we acquired  shares of our common stock for approximately million  at a volume weighted average price of per share 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  additional shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million  at a volume weighted average price of per share 
as of september  we repurchased  shares of our common stock representing almost the entire june authorization 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in open market or private transactions 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the september authorization 
as we operate in a number of countries around the world  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
our primary exposure relates to non us based operating expenses in the philippines  india and israel 
our us entity has historically funded expenditures for our foreign subsidiaries 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk and therefore we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuating future cash flows arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
we may continue to enter into these or other such instruments in the future  to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of these foreign currencies 
in addition to our exposure to future cash flows  a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are held by our operating foreign subsidiaries and therefore we are exposed to foreign exchange risk on such cash and cash equivalents and short term investments arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
at present  we do not enter into any hedging instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk on such assets  however  we may do so in the future 
future liquidity and capital resource requirements we have a million line of credit pursuant to which we may borrow up to of eligible accounts receivable 
borrowings under the credit line bear interest at the bank s alternate base rate plus or libor plus 
the line  which expires in june  is collateralized by our accounts receivable 
we have no outstanding obligations under this credit line as of december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  funds generated from our operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next twelve months 
however  if circumstances change  we may need to raise debt or additional equity capital in the future 
we have historically funded our foreign expenditures from our us corporate headquarters on an as needed basis 
in the second quarter of  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s  which will give us the ability to offer from time to time up to an aggregate of million of securities  which may consist of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  or units consisting of any of the foregoing 
the registration is intended to give us flexibility should financing opportunities arise 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual obligations in thousands at december   and the effect that those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
contractual obligations total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations vendor obligations non cancelable operating leases    total contractual cash obligations    future expected obligations under our pension benefit plans have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 
inflation  seasonality and prevailing economic conditions our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in asia 
we are exposed to higher inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate 
we generally perform work for our clients under project specific contracts  requirements based contracts or long term contracts 
we must adequately anticipate wage increases  particularly on our fixed price contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our clients 
our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations 
we experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects  which may have some normal start up delays  or we may be unable to replace a project entirely 
these and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  as some of our asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter  we typically incur higher wages  due to overtime  that reduce our margins 
critical accounting policies and estimates basis of presentation and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments  long lived assets  goodwill  valuation of deferred tax assets  value of securities underlying stock based compensation  litigation accruals  pension benefits  valuation of derivative instruments and estimated accruals for various tax exposures 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish credit terms for new clients based upon management s review of their credit information and project terms  and perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients  adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate  based upon payment history and an assessment of their current credit worthiness 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we determine this allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  our estimate of the client s current ability to pay its obligation to us  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
while credit losses have generally been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will be consistent with those experienced in the past 
in addition  we would have credit exposure if the financial condition of one of our major clients were to deteriorate 
in the event that the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in the period in which services are performed and delivery has occurred and when all the criteria of staff accounting bulletin have been met 
revenues for contracts billed on a time and materials basis are recognized as services are performed 
revenues under fixed fee contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting as services are performed or milestones are achieved 
revenues from fixed fee projects accounted for less than of our total revenue for each of the three years in the period ended december  certain reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of clients are recorded on a net basis in revenues 
long lived assets we assess the recoverability of long lived assets  which consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and iv a change in the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed  initially using a projected undiscounted cash flow method 
we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in the impairment review conducted by us  the carrying value of the fixed assets of our docgenix subsidiary exceeded its fair value 
we recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  no impairment charges were recorded for the years ended december  and income taxes we determine our deferred taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates  as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we consider future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future considering the future taxable income  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
change in valuation allowance from period to period is included in our tax provision in the period of change 
we indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries 
unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on distribution to the united states  because such earnings are not anticipated to be remitted to the united states 
in addition we have provided for an accrual for potential tax obligations resulting from income tax audits and other potential tax obligations 
we account for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions  and recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions under income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step fair value based test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
if impairment is determined  we will recognize additional charges to operating expenses in the period in which they are identified  which would result in a reduction of operating results and a reduction in the amount of goodwill 
our most recent test for impairment was conducted as of september   in which the estimated fair values of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as such  no impairment was identified or recorded 
accounting for stock based compensation we are authorized to grant stock options to officers  directors  employees and others who render services to the company under the stock plan approved by the stockholders 
we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
the fair value is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business 
our legal reserves related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not a loss is probable 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
the reserves are adjusted if necessary 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
pensions most of our non us subsidiaries provide for government mandated defined pension benefits covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
pension assumptions are significant inputs to actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations 
two critical assumptions discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurements 
these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually on a plan and a country specific basis 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors  and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of these differences are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted new guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb by presenting total comprehensive income loss and the components of net income loss in one statement 
the adoption of this guidance resulted only in a change in how we present other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated financial statements and did not have any impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued guidance on comprehensive income which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income 
this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to our credit line with a financial institution which is priced based on the bank s alternate base rate at december  plus or libor at december  plus 
we have not borrowed under this line in to the extent we utilize all or a portion of this line of credit  changes in the interest rate will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
foreign currency risk we have operations in several international markets that subject us to foreign currency fluctuations 
although the majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts is incurred in the local currencies of several international markets where we carry on our operations 
our significant operations are based in the philippines  india  sri lanka and israel where revenues are generated in us dollars and the corresponding expenses are generated in philippine peso  indian rupee  sri lanka rupee and israeli shekel 
to mitigate the exposure of fluctuating future cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
these foreign currency forward contracts were entered into with a maximum term of twelve months and have an aggregate notional amount of approximately million as of december  we may continue to enter into these  or other such instruments  in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of these foreign currencies 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations will continue to present economic challenges to us and could negatively impact our overall results of operations 
a appreciation in the us dollar s value relating to the hedged currencies would decrease the forward contracts fair value by approximately million as of december  similarly  a depreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the forward contracts fair value by approximately million as of december  any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive forward contracts  if utilized  would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying cash flows 
other than the aforementioned forward contracts  we have not engaged in any hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions or arrangements 
as of december   our foreign locations held cash and short term investments totaling approximately million 
these assets are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
at present  we do not enter into any hedging instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk on such assets  however  we may do so in the future
