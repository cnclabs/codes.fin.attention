borrowing sources include advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and overnight borrowings from the bank s customers and correspondent banks 
all borrowings  except for lines of credit with the bank s correspondent banks  require collateral in the form of loans or securities 
collateral levels  therefore  limit borrowings and the available lines of credit extended by the bank s creditors 
as a result  deposits remain critical to the future funding and growth of the business 
deposit growth within the banking industry has been subject to strong competition from a variety of financial services companies 
this competition may require financial institutions to adjust their product offerings and pricing to adequately grow deposits 
competition the banking business is highly competitive  and the profitability of mid penn depends principally upon the bank s ability to compete in its market area 
the bank actively competes with other financial services companies for deposit  loan  and trust business 
competitors include other commercial banks  credit unions  savings banks  savings and loan associations  insurance companies  securities brokerage firms  finance companies  mutual funds  and service alternatives via the internet 
financial institutions compete primarily on the quality of services rendered  interest rates on loans and deposits  service charges  the convenience of banking facilities  location and hours of operation and  in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers  relative lending limits 
many competitors are significantly larger than the bank and have significantly greater financial resources  personnel and locations from which to conduct business 
in addition  the bank is subject to banking regulations while certain competitors may not be 
there are relatively few barriers for companies wanting to enter into the financial services industry 
for more information  see the supervision and regulation section below 
mid penn bancorp  inc 
mid penn has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service 
mid penn s customer service model is based on convenient hours  efficient and friendly employees  local decision making  and quality products 
the gramm leach bliley act see discussion below  which breaks down many barriers between the banking  securities and insurance industries  may significantly affect the competitive environment in which mid penn operates 
the flow of cash into mutual funds  much of which is made through tax deferred investment vehicles such as k plans  and a generally strong economy  have  until recently  fueled high returns for these investments  in particular  certain equity funds 
the recent economic turmoil has negatively impacted the returns on many of these investments and impacted the manner in which investors distribute their funds across investment alternatives 
the safety of traditional bank products has again become an attractive option during this period of market volatility 
mid penn s ability to attract funds in the future will be impacted by the public s appetite for the safety of insured or local investments versus the returns offered by alternative choices as part of their personal investment mix 
supervision and regulation general bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws

gramm leach bliley financial modernization act the gramm leach bliley act glb became effective on march  the primary purpose of glb was to eliminate barriers between investment banking and commercial banking and to permit  within certain limitations  the affiliation of financial service providers

activities cited by glb as being financial in nature include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the federal reserve has determined to be closely related to banking 
in addition to permitting financial services providers to enter into new lines of business  the law allows firms the freedom to streamline existing operations and to potentially reduce costs

the fdic has not advised the bank of any specific minimum leverage ratios 
the capital ratios of mid penn and the bank are described in note to mid penn s consolidated financial statements  which are incorporated herein by reference 
banking regulators continue to indicate their desire to further develop capital requirements applicable to banking organizations 
changes to capital requirements could materially affect the profitability of mid penn or the fair value of mid penn stock 
fdic improvement act as a result of the fdic improvement act of  banks are subject to increased reporting requirements and more frequent examinations by the bank regulatory agencies 
the agencies also have the authority to dictate certain key decisions that formerly were left to management  including compensation standards  loan underwriting standards  asset growth  and payment of dividends 
failure to comply with these standards  or failure to maintain capital above specified levels set by the regulators  could lead to the imposition of penalties or the forced resignation of management 
if a bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the banking agencies have the authority to place an institution into receivership 
safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia  the federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards for depository institutions such as the bank 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines

if the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails to implement an accepted plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions be taken  including restricting asset growth  restricting interest rates paid on deposits  and requiring an increase in the institution s ratio of tangible equity to assets 
payment of dividends and other restrictions mid penn is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary  the bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the bank can  among other things  finance  or otherwise supply funds to  mid penn 
specifically  dividends from the bank are the principal source of mid penn s cash funds and there are certain legal restrictions under pennsylvania law and pennsylvania banking regulations on the payment of dividends by state chartered banks 
the relevant regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit mid penn and the bank from engaging in what  in the opinion of such regulatory body  constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the payment of dividends could  depending upon the financial condition of mid penn and the bank  be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice 
prompt corrective action in addition to the required minimum capital levels described above  federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective actions which federal banking agencies are required to take  and certain actions which they have discretion to take  based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls 
regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution  which is not adequately capitalized 
under the rules  an institution will be deemed to be adequately capitalized if it exceeds the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements 
however  it will be deemed undercapitalized if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than the prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan  along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party 
in addition  an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions mid penn bancorp  inc 
including a prohibition on payment of dividends  a limitation on asset growth and expansion  in certain cases  a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers  and a prohibition on the payment of certain management fees to any controlling person

in certain cases  bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors  or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser 
if an institution is deemed critically undercapitalized and continues in that category for four quarters  the statute requires  with certain narrowly limited exceptions  that the institution be placed in receivership 
deposit insurance the fdic insures deposits of the bank through the deposit insurance fund dif 
the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium 
the amount each institution is assessed is based upon a variety of factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund 
the fdic insures deposits up to  the bank pays an insurance premium into the dif based on the quarterly average daily deposit liabilities net of certain exclusions 
the fdic uses a risk based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the dif 
the fdic places each institution in one of four risk categories using a two step process based first on capital ratios the capital group assignment and then on other relevant information the supervisory group assignment 
subsequently  the rate for each institution within a risk category may be adjusted depending upon different factors that either enhance or reduce the risk the institution poses to the dif  including the unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposits related to each institution 
finally  certain risk multipliers may be applied to the adjusted assessment 
in  the fdic increased the amount assessed from financial institutions by increasing its risk based deposit insurance assessment scale 
the quarterly annualized assessment scale for ranged from twelve basis points of assessable deposits for the strongest institutions to basis points for the weakest 
on november   the fdic approved a rule to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and an insured institution s risk based deposit insurance assessments will continue to be calculated on a quarterly basis  but will be paid from the amount the institution prepaid until the later of the date that amount is exhausted or june   at which point any remaining funds would be returned to the insured institution 
consequently  mid penn s prepayment of dif premiums made in december resulted in a prepaid asset of  at december  at december    and the prepaid asset was   and  respectively 
beginning with the second quarter of  as mandated by the recently enacted dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  the assessment base that the fdic will use to calculate assessment premiums will be a bank s average assets minus average tangible equity 
as the asset base of the banking industry is larger than the deposit base  the range of assessment rates will change to a low of basis points through a high of basis points  per of assets  however  the dollar amount of total actual premiums is expected to be roughly the same 
the fdic is required under the dodd frank act to establish assessment rates that will allow the deposit insurance fund to achieve a reserve ratio of of insurance fund insured deposits by september in addition  the fdic has established a designated reserve ratio of  a target ratio that  until it is achieved  will not likely result in the fdic reducing assessment rates 
in attempting to achieve the mandated ratio  the fdic is required to implement assessment formulas that charge banks over billion in asset size more than banks under that size 
those new formulas began in the second quarter of  but did not affect the bank 
under the dodd frank act  the fdic is authorized to make reimbursements from the insurance fund to banks if the reserve ratio exceeds  but the fdic has adopted the designated reserve ratio of and has announced that any reimbursements from the fund are indefinitely suspended 
proposed regulatory capital changes in june  the federal reserve bank  the fdic and the occ issued proposed rules that would revise bank regulatory capital requirements and the risk weighted asset rules 
these rules represent the most extensive changes to bank capital requirements in the recent past 
the rules will extend large parts of a regulatory capital administration to all us banks and their holding companies  other than the smallest bank holding companies generally  those with under million in consolidated assets 
the implementation of the rules has been delayed several times and it is uncertain when they will go into effect at this time 
below is a summary summary of proposed rules for capital revise the definition of regulatory capital components and related calculations  which would include conservative guidelines for determining whether an instrument could qualify as regulatory capital  add common equity tier capital as a new regulatory capital component  increase the minimum tier capital ratio requirement  create a capital conservation buffer that would limit payment of capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the institution does not hold enough common equity tier capital  provide for a transition period for several aspects of the rule  and mid penn bancorp  inc 
incorporate the new and revised regulatory capital requirements into the prompt corrective action rules 
summary of proposed rules for risk weighted assets the proposal would expand the number of risk weighted categories and increase the required capital for certain categories of assets  including higher risk residential mortgages and higher risk construction real estate loans 
in addition  the rule would revise risk weights for residential mortgages based on ltv ratios and certain loan characteristics  assigning risk weights between and increase capital requirements for past due loans from to and set the risk weight for high volatility commercial real estate loans at  and revise the risk weighted percentage for unused commitments with an original maturity of one year or less from to unless the commitment is unconditionally cancelable by the bank 
the risk weighted asset rule will apply to all us banks and savings banks and almost all of their holding companies  although smaller  non complex banking organizations will not need to comply with some of the rule s requirements 
the corporation is in the process of assessing the impact of these proposed changes on the regulatory ratios of the corporation and the bank on the capital  operations  liquidity and earnings of the corporation and bank 
environmental laws management does not anticipate that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have any material effect on mid penn s capital  expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
however  environmentally related hazards have become a source of high risk and potentially unlimited liability for financial institutions 
in  the pennsylvania general assembly enacted the economic development agency  fiduciary and lender environmental liability protection act  which among other things  provides protection to lenders from environmental liability and remediation costs under the environmental laws for releases and contamination caused by others 
a lender who engages in activities involved in the routine practices of commercial lending  including  but not limited to  the providing of financial services  holding of security interests  workout practices  foreclosure or the recovery of funds from the sale of property shall not be liable under the environmental acts or common law equivalents to the pennsylvania department of environmental resources or to any other person by virtue of the fact that the lender engages in such commercial lending practice 
a lender  however  will be liable if it  its employees or agents  directly cause an immediate release or directly exacerbate a release of regulated substance on or from the property  or known and willfully compelled the borrower to commit an action which caused such release or violate an environmental act 
the economic development agency  fiduciary and lender environmental liability protection act does not limit federal liability which still exists under certain circumstances 
consumer protection laws a number of laws govern the relationship between the bank and its customers 
for example  the community reinvestment act is designed to encourage lending by banks to persons in low and moderate income areas 
the home mortgage disclosure act and the equal credit opportunity act attempt to minimize lending decisions based on impermissible criteria  such as race or gender 
the truth in lending act and the truth in savings act require banks to provide certain disclosure of relevant terms related to loans and savings accounts  respectively 
anti tying restrictions which prohibit conditioning the availability or terms of credit on the purchase of another banking product further restrict the bank s relationships with its customers 
privacy laws in  the federal banking regulators issued final regulations implementing certain provisions of glb governing the privacy of consumer financial information 
the regulations limit the disclosure by financial institutions  such as mid penn and the bank  of nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain financial products or services for personal  family  or household purposes 
subject to certain exceptions allowed by law  the regulations cover information sharing between financial institutions and nonaffiliated third parties 
more specifically  the regulations require financial institutions to provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  provide annual notices of their privacy policies to their current customers  and provide a reasonable method for consumers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
mid penn bancorp  inc 
protection of customer information in  the federal banking regulators issued final regulations implementing the provisions of glb relating to the protection of customer information 
the regulations  applicable to mid penn and the bank  relate to administrative  technical  and physical safeguards for customer records and information 
these safeguards are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records  and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
affiliate transactions transactions between mid penn and the bank and its affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of a bank or savings institution is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by  or is under common control with the bank or savings institution 
generally  a subsidiary of a depository institution that is not also a depository institution is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of sections a and b 
sections a and b are intended to protect insured depository institutions from suffering losses arising from transactions with non insured affiliates  by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate  and requiring that such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
effective april   regulation w of the federal reserve comprehensively amended sections a and b 
the regulation unifies and updates staff interpretations issued over the years  incorporates several new interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate  and addresses new issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of non banking activities engaged in by bank and bank holding companies in recent years and authorized for financial holding companies under the glb 
the usa patriot act in  the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act was signed into law 
the usa patriot act broadened the application of anti money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions  such as broker dealers  and strengthened the ability of the us government to detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions  including state chartered banks establish an anti money laundering program that includes training and audit components  comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account  take additional required precautions with non us owned accounts  and perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships 
the usa patriot act also expanded the conditions under which funds in a us interbank account may be subject to forfeiture and increased the penalties for violation of anti money laundering regulations 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
the bank has adopted policies  procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the usa patriot act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies  procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations 
anti money laundering and anti terrorism financing under title iii of the usa patriot act  also known as the international money laundering abatement and anti terrorism financing act of  all financial institutions  including mid penn and the bank  are required in general to identify their customers  adopt formal and comprehensive anti money laundering programs  scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern  and be prepared to respond to inquiries from us law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions 
additional information sharing among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement authorities is encouraged by the presence of an exemption from the privacy provisions of the glb act for financial institutions that comply with this provision and the authorization of the secretary of the treasury to adopt rules to further encourage cooperation and information sharing 
the effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the bank merger act  which applies to the bank 
jobs act on april   president obama signed the jumpstart our business startups act the jobs act into law 
the jobs act is aimed at facilitating capital raising by smaller companies and banks and bank holding companies by implementing the following changes mid penn bancorp  inc 
raising the threshold requiring registration under the securities exchange act of the exchange act for banks and bank holdings companies from to  holders of record  raising the threshold for triggering deregistration under the exchange act for banks and bank holding companies from to  holders of record  raising the limit for regulation a offerings from million to million per year and exempting some regulation a offerings from state blue sky laws  permitting advertising and general solicitation in rule and rule a offerings  allowing private companies to use crowdfunding to raise up to million in any month period  subject to certain conditions  and creating a new category of issuer  called an emerging growth company  for companies with less than billion in annual gross revenue  which will benefit from certain changes that reduce the cost and burden of carrying out an equity ipo and complying with public company reporting obligations for up to five years 
while the jobs act is not expected to have any immediate application to the corporation  management will continue to monitor the implementation rules for potential effects which might benefit the corporation 
dodd frank act the dodd frank act  which became law in july  significantly changes regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry  including creating a financial services oversight council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation  centralizing responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  which will be responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws  permanently raising the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  establishing strengthened capital standards for banks  and disallowing certain trust preferred securities from qualifying as tier capital subject to certain grandfather provisions for existing trust preferred securities  establishing new minimum mortgage underwriting standards  granting the federal reserve board the power to regulate debit card interchange fees  and implementing corporate governance changes 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking that will take effect over several years  thus making it difficult to assess the impact of the statute on the financial industry  including mid penn  at this time 
it is difficult to predict at this time the specific impact the dodd frank act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations is presently unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
effects of government policy and potential changes in regulation changes in regulations applicable to mid penn or the bank  or shifts in monetary or other government policies  could have a material effect on our business 
mid penn s and the bank s business is also affected by the state of the financial services industry in general 
as a result of legal and industry changes  management believes that the industry will continue to experience an increased rate of change as the financial services industry strives for greater product offerings  market share and economies of scale 
from time to time  legislation is enacted that has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  and before various bank regulatory agencies 
mid penn cannot predict the likelihood of any major changes or the impact such changes might have on mid penn and or the bank 
various congressional bills and other proposals have proposed a sweeping overhaul of the banking system  including provisions for limitations on deposit insurance coverage  changing the timing and method financial institutions use to pay for deposit insurance  expanding the power of banks by removing the restrictions on bank underwriting activities  and tightening the regulation of bank derivatives activities  and allowing commercial enterprises to own banks 
mid penn s earnings are  and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had  and will likely continue to have  an impact on the operating results of commercial banks because of the federal reserve s power to implement national monetary policy to  among other things  curb inflation or combat recession 
the federal reserve has a major impact on the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
from time to time  various types of federal and state legislation have been proposed that could result in additional regulation of  and restrictions on  the business of mid penn and the bank 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the united states  mid penn bancorp  inc 
the bank s business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal legislation and regulations that may increase the costs of doing business 
congress is currently debating major legislation that may fundamentally change the regulatory oversight of banking institutions in the united states 
whether any legislation will be enacted or additional regulations will be adopted  and how they might impact mid penn cannot be determined at this time

item a 
risk factors mid penn is subject to interest rate risk mid penn s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond mid penn s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest mid penn receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i mid penn s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of mid penn s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of mid penn s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  mid penn s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on mid penn s results of operations 
any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
mid penn is subject to lending risk as of december   approximately of mid penn s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans 
these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
because mid penn s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
mid penn s allowance for possible loan and lease losses may be insufficient mid penn maintains an allowance for possible loan and lease losses  which is a reserve established through provisions for possible losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires mid penn to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem mid penn bancorp  inc 
credits and other factors  both within and outside of mid penn s control  may require an increase in the allowance 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review mid penn s allowance for possible loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance  mid penn may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect mid penn s profitability mid penn s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating both commercial and consumer loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  credit unions  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of its competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce the corporation s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of mid penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition  and more convenient branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than mid penn  which could decrease the deposits that mid penn attracts or require mid penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect mid penn s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  mid penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds 
mid penn s banking subsidiary also competes with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations  which may offer more favorable terms 
some of its non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over mid penn s banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit mid penn s margins on banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
we have  shares of series b preferred stock outstanding which have preference over the common stock as to dividends and liquidation distributions  among other preferential rights as of the date hereof  we have issued and outstanding  shares of non cumulative  non voting  non convertible perpetual preferred stock  series b  par value per share the series b preferred stock 
the series b preferred stock affords holders a preference to assets upon liquidation and an annual dividend which rights impact the outstanding shares of common stock 
the preferred stock right to annual dividends makes less likely the possibility that we will declare dividends on the common stock 
in the event of a liquidation of the corporation assets  holders of series b preferred stock will have a right to receive as a liquidation payment any remaining assets of the corporation prior to any distributions to holders of the common stock and the holders of the series b preferred stock may be able to block actions otherwise approved by the holders of the common stock if such action is adverse to their rights 
the basel iii capital requirements may require us to maintain higher levels of capital  which could reduce our profitability if adopted as proposed  basel iii targets higher levels of base capital  certain capital buffers and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital 
although the new capital requirements are phased in over the next decade and may change substantially before final implementation  basel iii signals a growing effort by domestic and international bank regulatory agencies to require financial institutions  including depository institutions  to maintain higher levels of capital 
the direction of the basel iii implementation activities or other regulatory viewpoints could require additional capital to support our business risk profile prior to final implementation of the basel iii standards 
if mid penn is required to maintain higher levels of capital  mid penn may have fewer opportunities to invest capital into interest earning assets  which could limit the profitable business operations available to mid penn and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
future credit downgrades of the united states government due to issues relating to debt and the deficit may adversely affect the mid penn as a result of failure of the federal government to reach agreement over federal debt and the ongoing issues connected with the debt ceiling  certain rating agencies placed the united states government s long term sovereign debt rating on their equivalent of negative watch and announced the possibility of a rating downgrade 
the rating agencies  due to constraints related to the rating of the united states  also placed government sponsored enterprises in which mid penn invests and receives lines of credit on negative watch and a downgrade of the united state s credit rating would trigger a similar downgrade in the credit rating of these government sponsored enterprises 
furthermore  the credit rating of other entities  such as state and local governments  may also be downgraded should the united states credit rating be downgraded 
the impact that a credit rating downgrade may have on the national and local economy could have an adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
mid penn bancorp  inc 
a breach of information security could negatively affect our earnings increasingly  we depend upon data processing  communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks  and over the internet 
while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents  we cannot be certain all our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack  despite safeguards we have instituted 
in addition  we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs 
disruptions to our vendors systems may arise from events that are wholly or partially beyond our vendors control including  for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages 
if information security is breached  despite the controls we and our third party vendors have instituted  information can be lost or misappropriated  resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others 
these costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage  if any  which would adversely affect our earnings 
in addition  our reputation could be damaged which could result in loss of customers  greater difficulty in attracting new customers  or an adverse affect on the value of our common stock 
mid penn s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management periodically reviews and updates mid penn s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of mid penn s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
mid penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiary  which is subject to regulatory limits mid penn is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries 
its ability to pay dividends depends on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits  and retained earnings  imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies 
the ability of mid penn s subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability  financial condition  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
there is no assurance that mid penn s subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that mid penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future 
federal reserve board policy  which applies to mid penn as a registered bank holding company  also provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one year period 
mid penn s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock 
mid penn s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in central pennsylvania mid penn s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in central pennsylvania  especially in dauphin  lower northumberland  western schuylkill and eastern cumberland counties  which mid penn defines as our primary market 
the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation  recession  unemployment  real estate values  trends in the national and global economics  and other factors beyond our control 
an economic recession or a delayed recovery over a prolonged period of time in central pennsylvania area could cause an increase in the level of the bank s non performing assets and loan and lease losses  thereby causing operating losses  impairing liquidity  and eroding capital 
mid penn cannot assure you that adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on mid penn s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
mid penn may not be able to attract and retain skilled people mid penn s success depends  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by mid penn can be intense and mid penn may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of mid penn s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on mid penn s business because of their skills  knowledge of mid penn s market  years of industry experience  and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
mid penn is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to mid penn s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to mid penn s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to mid penn they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of mid penn and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
the trading volume in mid penn s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies mid penn s common stock is listed for trading on nasdaq  the trading volume in its common stock  however  is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of mid penn s common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the mid penn bancorp  inc 
individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which mid penn has no control 
given the lower trading volume of mid penn s common stock  significant sales of mid penn s common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause mid penn s stock price to fall 
mid penn operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations mid penn is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal  state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on mid penn and its operations 
additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect mid penn s powers  authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on mid penn s results of operations and financial condition 
in response to the financial crisis that commenced in  congress has taken actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions  and the federal deposit insurance corporation has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts 
the recently enacted dodd frank act provides for the creation of a consumer protection division at the board of governors of the federal reserve system that will have broad authority to issue regulations governing the services and products we provide consumers 
this additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely impact our operations 
that legislation also contains provisions that  over time  could result in higher regulatory capital requirements and loan loss provisions for the bank  and may increase interest expense due to the ability in july to pay interest on all demand deposits 
in addition  there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
these proposals could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
recent regulatory changes impose limits on our ability to charge overdraft fees  which may decrease our non interest income as compared to more recent prior periods 
the potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations  or changes in policy  affecting many aspects of our operations  including capital levels  lending and funding practices  and liquidity standards 
new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations  and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our loans and investments  the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
the soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect mid penn financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
mid penn has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose mid penn to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  mid penn s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by mid penn cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to mid penn 
any such losses could have a material adverse affect on the mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
prior levels of market volatility were unprecedented and future volatility may have materially adverse effects on our liquidity and financial condition in the recent past  the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption for more than two years 
in some cases  the markets exerted downward pressure on stock prices  security prices  and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength 
if the such levels of market disruption and volatility return  there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects  which may be material  on our liquidity  financial condition  and profitability 
mid penn s banking subsidiary may be required to pay higher fdic insurance premiums or special assessments which may adversely affect its earning 
poor economic conditions and the resulting bank failures have increased the costs of the fdic and depleted its deposit insurance fund 
additional bank failures may prompt the fdic to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue special assessments 
mid penn generally is unable to control the amount of premiums or special assessments that its subsidiary is required to pay for fdic insurance 
any future changes in the calculation or assessment of fdic insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock at the current rate or at all 
pennsylvania business corporation law and various anti takeover provisions under our articles and bylaws could impede the takeover of mid penn various pennsylvania laws affecting business corporations may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire mid penn  even if the acquisition would be advantageous to shareholders 
in addition  we have various anti takeover measures in place under our articles of mid penn bancorp  inc 
incorporation and bylaws  including a supermajority vote requirement for mergers  a staggered board of directors  and the absence of cumulative voting 
any one or more of these measures may impede the takeover of mid penn without the approval of our board of directors and may prevent our shareholders from taking part in a transaction in which they could realize a premium over the current market price of our common stock 
mid penn may need to or be required to raise additional capital in the future  and capital may not be available when needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders federal banking regulators require mid penn and its subsidiary bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations 
these capital levels are determined and dictated by law  regulation  and banking regulatory agencies 
in addition  capital levels are also determined by mid penn s management and board of directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support mid penn s business operations 
if mid penn raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities  it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock 
furthermore  a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on mid penn s stock price 
new investors also may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to mid penn s current shareholders  which may adversely impact its current shareholders 
mid penn s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of its control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  mid penn cannot be certain of its ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms and acceptable time frames or to raise additional capital at all 
if mid penn cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed  its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired 
additionally  the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect mid penn s financial condition and results of operations 
mid penn s profitability depends significantly on the economic conditions in the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the local region in which it does business mid penn s profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the specific markets in which mid penn operates 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  mid penn provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in south central pennsylvania 
the local economic conditions in this area has a significant impact on the demand for mid penn s products and services  as well as the ability of mid penn s customers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing loans  and the stability of mid penn s deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment  changes in securities markets  or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  consequently  have a material adverse effect on mid penn s financial condition and results of operation 
if we conclude that the decline in the value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary  we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings we review our investment securities portfolio at each quarter end reporting period to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value 
when the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value  we are required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary 
if we conclude that the decline is other than temporary  we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings 
changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and or prolonged price declines have resulted and may result in our concluding in future periods that there is additional impairment of these securities that is other than temporary  which would require a charge to earnings to write down these securities to their fair value 
due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset is impaired  the impairment disclosed may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future 
mid penn s financial performance may suffer if its information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments effective and competitive delivery of mid penn s products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes  both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables mid penn to reduce costs 
mid penn s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations 
many of mid penn s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
additionally  as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves  keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for mid penn 
there can be no assurance that mid penn will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce its ability to compete effectively

the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
mid penn s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements due to a variety of factors  including  without limitation the effects of economic deterioration on current customers  specifically the effect of the economy on loan customers ability to repay loans  governmental monetary and fiscal policies  as well as legislative and regulatory changes  including the effects of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the effects of the failure of the federal government to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling or avoid sequester  and the negative results on economic or business conditions resulting therefrom  the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices  as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies  as well as the financial accounting standards board and other accounting standard setters  the risks of changes in interest rates on the level and composition of deposits  loan demand  and the values of loan collateral  securities and interest rate protection agreements  as well as interest rate risks  the effects of competition from other commercial banks  thrifts  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market and other mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in mid penn s market area and elsewhere  including institutions operating locally  regionally  nationally and internationally  together with such competitors offering banking products and services by mail  telephone  computer and the internet  the costs and effects of litigation and of unexpected or adverse outcomes in such litigation  technological changes  acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses  the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan and lease losses and estimations of values of collateral and various financial assets and liabilities  acts of war or terrorism  volatilities in the securities markets  and deteriorating economic conditions 
all written or oral forward looking statements attributable to mid penn are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of mid penn s consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation and notes thereto and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
mid penn is not aware of any known trends  events  uncertainties or of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on mid penn s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
critical accounting estimates mid penn s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and estimates that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
management of the corporation considers the accounting judgments relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses  the evaluation of the corporation s investment securities for other than temporary impairment  and the assessment of goodwill for impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which mid penn bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis may be susceptible to significant change

valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  investment valuation is based on pricing models  quotes for similar investment securities  and observable yield curves and spreads 
in addition to valuation  management must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of the investments that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of the loss in the consolidated statement of income

management s discussion and analysis provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
mid penn s provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s monthly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans and leases  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan and lease growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve 
during  mid penn continued to experience a challenging economic and operating environment 
given the economic pressures that impact some borrowers  mid penn has maintained the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with mid penn s assessment process  which took into consideration the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio and shifting collateral values from december  to december  for the year ended december   the provision for loan and lease losses was  as compared to  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   mid penn had net charge offs of  compared to net charge offs of  during the year ended december  loans charged off during were comprised of fifteen commercial real estate loans totaling  eight of these loans totaling  were to three borrowers with the remaining loans to unrelated borrowers

following its model for loan and lease loss allowance adequacy  management recorded a  provision in  as well as a provision of  in  and  in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to at december  and at december  several factors contributed to this reduction 
first  the growth in the loan portfolio was very modest 
this modest growth did not have a material impact on the amount of required reserves within the allowance for loan and lease losses from qualitative or quantitative factors 
secondly  while total risk elements within the loan portfolio remained virtually unchanged from to  their composition within the allowance computation model changed significantly 
loans internally classified as special mention fell from  at december  to  at december   or a reduction of  loans internally classified as substandard but not impaired increased  from  at december  to  at december  additionally during  the historic loss experience within these segments of the portfolio migrated downward as high levels of activity during rolled out of the calculation and were replaced by more current experience 
the combination of the shifting balances and migrating loss experience resulted in a reduction of  in required balances in the allowance for loan and lease losses

mid penn does not normally structure construction loans with interest reserve components 
mid penn has not in the past performed any commercial real estate or other type loan workouts whereby an existing loan was restructured into multiple new loans 
also  mid penn does not extend loans at maturity solely due to the existence of guarantees  without recognizing the credit as impaired

further discussion of troubled debt restructured loans can be found in note to mid penn s consolidated financial statements  which are incorporated herein by reference 
as of december   there were no defaulted troubled debt restructured loans as all troubled debt restructured loans were current with respect to their associated forbearance agreements 
mid penn entered into forbearance agreements on all loans currently classified as troubled debt restructures and all of these agreements have resulted in additional principal repayment

mid penn considers a commercial loan or commercial real estate loan to be impaired when it becomes days or more past due and not in the process of collection 
this methodology assumes the borrower cannot or will not continue to make additional payments 
at that time the loan would be considered collateral dependent as the discounted cash flow dcf method indicates no operating income is available for evaluating the collateral position  therefore  all impaired loans are deemed to be collateral dependent 
mid penn evaluates loans for charge off on a monthly basis 
policies that govern the recommendation for charge off are unique to the type of loan being considered 
commercial loans rated as nonaccrual or lower will first have a collateral evaluation completed in accordance with the guidance on impaired loans 
once the collateral evaluation has been completed  a specific allocation of allowance is made based upon the results of the evaluation 
in the event the loan is unsecured  the loan would have been charged off at the recognition of impairment 
if the loan is secured  it will undergo a day waiting period to ensure the collateral shortfall identified in the evaluation is accurate and then charged down by the specific allocation 
once the charge down is taken  the remaining balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact not restructured 
commercial real estate loans rated as impaired will also have an initial collateral evaluation completed in accordance with the guidance on impaired loans 
an updated real estate valuation is ordered and the collateral evaluation is modified to reflect any variations in value 
a specific allocation of allowance is made for any anticipated collateral shortfall and a day waiting period begins to ensure the accuracy of the collateral shortfall 
the loan is then charged down by the specific allocation 
once the charge down is taken  the remaining balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact not restructured 
the process of charge off for residential mortgage loans begins upon a loan becoming delinquent for days and not in the process of collection 
the existing appraisal is reviewed and a lien search is obtained to determine lien position and any instances of intervening liens 
a new appraisal of the property will be ordered if deemed necessary by management and a collateral evaluation is completed 
the loan will then be charged down to the value indicated in the evaluation 
consumer loans are recommended for charge off after reaching delinquency of days and the loan is not in the process of collection 
the entire balance of the consumer loan is recommended for charge off at this point 
as noted above  mid penn assesses a specific allocation for both commercial loans and commercial real estate loans prior to charging down or charging off the loan 
once the charge down is taken  the remaining balance remains a nonperforming loan with the original terms and interest rate intact not restructured 
in addition  mid penn takes a preemptive step when any commercial loan or commercial real estate loan becomes classified under its internal classification system 
a preliminary collateral evaluation in accordance with the guidance on impaired loans is prepared using the existing collateral information in the loan file 
this process allows mid penn to review both the credit and documentation files to determine the status of the information needed to make a collateral evaluation 
this collateral evaluation is preliminary but allows mid penn to determine if any potential collateral shortfalls exist 
larger groups of small balance loans  such as residential mortgages and consumer installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  individual consumer and residential loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement 
mid penn bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis mid penn s rating system assumes any loans classified as sub standard non accrual to be impaired  and all of these loans are considered collateral dependent  therefore  all of mid penn s impaired loans  whether reporting a specific allocation or not  are considered collateral dependent 
it is mid penn s policy to obtain updated third party valuations on all impaired loans collateralized by real estate within days of the credit being classified as sub standard non accrual 
prior to receipt of the updated real estate valuation mid penn will use any existing real estate valuation to determine any potential allowance issues  however no allowance recommendation will be made until which time mid penn is in receipt of the updated valuation 
the credit department employs an electronic tracking system to monitor the receipt of and need for updated appraisals 
to date  there have been no significant time lapses noted with the above processes 
in some instances mid penn is not holding real estate as collateral and is relying on business assets personal property for repayment 
in these circumstances a collateral inspection is performed by mid penn personnel to determine an estimated value 
the value is based on net book value  as provided by the financial statements  and discounted accordingly based on determinations made by management 
occasionally  mid penn will employ an outside service to provide a fair estimate of value based on auction sales or private sales 
management reviews the estimates of these third parties and discounts them accordingly based on management s judgment  if deemed necessary 
for impaired loans with no valuation allowance required  mid penn s practice of obtaining independent third party market valuations on the subject property within days of being placed on non accrual status sometimes indicates that the loan to value ratio is sufficient to obviate the need for a specific allocation in spite of significant deterioration in real estate values in mid penn s primary market area 
these circumstances are determined on a case by case analysis of the impaired loans 
mid penn actively monitors the values of collateral on impaired loans 
this monitoring may require the modification of collateral values over time or changing circumstances by some factor  either positive or negative  from the original values 
all collateral values will be assessed by management at least every months for possible revaluation by an independent third party 
mid penn does not currently  or plan in the future to  use automated valuation methodologies as a method of valuing real estate collateral 
as of december   mid penn had several unrelated loan relationships  with an aggregate carrying balance of  deemed impaired 
this pool of loans is further broken down into a group of loans with an aggregate carrying balance of  for which specific allocations totaling  have been included within the loan loss reserve for these loans 
the remaining  of loans requires no specific allocation within the loan loss reserve 
the  pool of impaired loan relationships is comprised of  in real estate secured commercial relationships and  in business relationships 
there are specific allocations against the real estate secured pool totaling  spread among thirteen relationships composed primarily of customers engaged in real estate investment activities 
the group of impaired business relationships with specific allocations is made up of six relationships and a specific allocation of  has been set aside against these credits 
five small business relationships account for  of the specific allocations due to the negative effects of the economy on their businesses 
one additional large commercial participation loan in this pool has shown exceptional collateral devaluation and is responsible for a specific allocation of  of the total pool attributable to this segment 
management currently believes that the specific reserves are adequate to cover probable future losses related to these relationships 
the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established in the form of a provision expense for loan and lease losses and is reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
in conjunction with an internal loan review function that operates independently of the lending function  management monitors the loan portfolio to identify risk on a monthly basis so that an appropriate allowance is maintained 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a monthly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses to the board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review 
in making the evaluation  management considers the results of recent regulatory examinations  which typically include a review of the allowance for loan and lease losses an integral part of the examination process 
in establishing the allowance  management evaluates on a quantitative basis individual classified loans and nonaccrual loans  and determines an aggregate reserve for those loans based on that review 
in addition  an allowance for the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio is determined based on historical loss experience within certain components of the portfolio 
these allocations may be modified if current conditions indicate that loan and lease losses may differ from historical experience 
mid penn bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis in addition  a portion of the allowance is established for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio which have not been identified by the quantitative processes described above 
this determination inherently involves a higher degree of subjectivity  and considers risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in historical loss experience 
these factors include changes in local  regional  and national economic and business conditions affecting the collectability of the portfolio  the values of underlying collateral  and the condition of various market segments 
changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of nonaccrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff as well as the quality of the institution s loan review system 
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and the terms of loans generally offered 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
while the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level believed to be adequate by management for covering estimated losses in the loan and lease portfolio  determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
changes in these estimates may impact the provisions charged to expense in future periods 
management believes  based on information currently available  that the allowance for loan and lease losses of  is adequate as of december  the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses among the major classifications is shown in table as of december of each of the past five years

the detailed computation of the bank s regulatory capital ratios can be found in note of item  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the greater a corporation s capital resources  the more likely it is to meet its cash obligations and absorb unforeseen losses 
too much capital  however  indicates that not enough of the corporation s earnings have been invested in the continued growth of the business or paid to shareholders 
the buildup makes it difficult for a corporation to offer a competitive return on the shareholders capital going forward 
for these reasons capital adequacy has been  and will continue to be  of paramount importance

liquidity mid penn asset liability management policy addresses the management of mid penn liquidity position and its ability to raise sufficient funds to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan growth and meet other operational needs 
mid penn utilizes its investments as a source of liquidity  along with deposit growth and increases in repurchase agreements and borrowings

liquidity from investments is provided primarily through investments and interest bearing balances with maturities of one year or less

effects of inflation a bank asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on its financial results depends principally upon mid penn ability to manage the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  mitigate the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same magnitude as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how mid penn is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net liabilities  as well as the composition of loans  investments and deposits should be considered

management s discussion and analysis item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  mid penn s primary source of market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in mid penn s future earnings earnings at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure or sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of mid penn portfolio of assets and liabilities 
each asset and liability reprices either at maturity or during the life of the instrument 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in a future period of time 
the principal purpose of asset liability management is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
net interest income is increased by increasing the net interest margin and by volume growth 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at an acceptable level 
mid penn utilizes an asset liability management model to measure the impact of interest rate movements on its interest rate sensitivity position 
mid penn s management also reviews the traditional maturity gap analysis regularly 
mid penn does not always attempt to achieve an exact match between interest sensitive assets and liabilities because it believes that an actively managed amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate in the management of the corporation s profitability 
modeling techniques and simulation analysis involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  non maturing deposit sensitivity  and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of mid penn s interest rate risk position over time 
management reviews interest rate risk on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes earnings scenarios whereby interest rates are increased and decreased by   and basis points 
these scenarios  detailed in table  indicate that mid penn would experience enhanced net interest income over a one year time frame due to upward interest rate changes  while a reduction in interest rates would result in a less pronounced reduction in net interest income over a one year time frame  however  actual results could vary significantly from the calculations prepared by management 
at december   all interest rate risk levels according to the model were within the tolerance limits of board approved policy with the exception of the up basis point scenario 
because this variance is to the benefit of mid penn  management is monitoring the situation but not taking any action at this time to remedy the variance to policy 
in addition  the table does not take into consideration changes  which management would make to realign its portfolio in the event of a changing rate environment
