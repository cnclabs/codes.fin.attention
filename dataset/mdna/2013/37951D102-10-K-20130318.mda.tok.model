item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations  estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in this form k  the company is restating i its audited financial statements as of  and for the period from february  date of inception to  december  and ii its unaudited interim financial statements as of  and for the quarterly periods ended  june  and september  and and march  the restatement results from the company prior accounting for its outstanding common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with its initial public offering in may as components of equity instead of as derivative liabilities 
the warrant agreement governing the warrants includes a provision the exercise price reduction provision that requires the company to reduce the exercise price by a stated formula if i the company completes a transaction involving a reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of its common stock  a merger or consolidation in which it is not the surviving company  or a sale of its assets and ii more than of the consideration payable to common stockholders as a result of that transaction is not common stock listed on a national securities exchange or the otc bulletin board 
in connection with the audit of the company s financial statements for the year ended december   the company s management further evaluated the warrants under accounting standards codification asc subtopic  contracts in entity s own equity 
asc section addresses equity versus liability treatment and classification of equity linked financial instruments  including common stock purchase warrants  and states that a warrant may be classified as a component of equity only if  among other things  the warrant is indexed to the issuer s common stock 
under asc section  a warrant is not indexed to the issuer s common stock if the terms of the warrant require an adjustment to the exercise price upon a specified event and that event is not an input to the fair value of the warrant 
based on management s evaluation  the company s audit committee  in consultation with management and after discussion with rothstein kass  the company s independent registered public accounting firm  concluded that the company s warrants are not indexed to the company s common stock in the manner contemplated by asc section because the transactions that would trigger the exercise price reduction provision are not inputs to the fair value of the warrants 
as a result  the company should have classified the warrants as derivative liabilities in its previously issued financial statements 
under this accounting treatment  the company is required to measure the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognize changes in the fair value from the prior period in the company s operating results for the current period 
the company s accounting for the warrants as components of equity instead of as derivative liabilities did not have any effect on the company s previously reported revenue  operating expenses  operating income  cash flows or cash 
the company has not amended its previously filed annual report on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatement

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and income and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash held in trust a total of  including approximately  of the net proceeds from our initial public offering   from the sale of the sponsor warrants and  of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  was placed in a trust account with american stock transfer trust company  llc serving as trustee 
the trust proceeds are invested in us government treasury bills with a maturity of days or less or money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations 
as of december   the balance in the trust account was  which includes  of interest earned since the inception of the trust 
warrant liability the company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with its public offering in accordance with the guidance contained in asc d under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities 
accordingly  the company classifies the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period 
this liability is subject to re measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised  and any change in fair value is recognized in the company s statement of operations 
the fair value of warrants issued by the company in the initial public offering and private placements has been estimated using the public warrants quoted market price 
income loss per common share basic income loss per common share is computed by dividing income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period in accordance with asc  earnings per share 
diluted income loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming common shares were issued upon the exercise of outstanding in the money warrants and the proceeds thereof were used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period 
the company uses the treasury stock method to calculate potentially dilutive shares  as if they were converted into common stock at the beginning of the period 
at december  and  the company had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
for all periods presented  the weighted average of these shares was excluded from the calculation of diluted income loss per common share because their inclusion would have been anti dilutive 
as a result  dilutive income loss per common share is equal to basic income loss per common share 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements management does not believe that any recently issued  but not effective  accounting standards  if currently adopted  would have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
we are not presently engaged in and  if we do not consummate a suitable business combination prior to the prescribed liquidation date of the trust account  we may not engage in  any substantive commercial business 
accordingly  we are not and  until such time as we consummate a business combination  we will not be  exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market driven rates or prices 
the net proceeds of our initial public offering held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of days or less or money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations 
given our limited risk in our exposure to government securities and money market funds  we do not view the interest rate risk to be significant
