item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our seat reconfiguration program 
we had one owned boeing aircraft being prepared for revenue service at december  this aircraft was placed in revenue service in january as of december   we have entered into lease agreements for nine a aircraft and purchase agreements for seven a aircraft 
based on scheduled delivery dates  these used aircraft will have an average age of approximately years at induction into the fleet 
the table below provides the expected number of operating aircraft at the end of each respective year based on scheduled deliveries of aircraft and md announced retirements number of aircraft at end of year md b a a total reflects announced retirement of two md aircraft and five seat md aircraft not included in the seat reconfiguration program 
does not include two additional aircraft which we expect to purchase from the owner of the other a aircraft  but which are not under contract at this time 
ground facilities we lease facilities at each of our leisure destinations and several of the other airports we serve 
our leases for our terminal passenger services facilities  which include ticket counter and gate space  and operations support areas  generally have a term ranging from month to month to two years  and may be terminated with a to day notice 
we have also entered into use agreements at each of the airports we serve that provide for non exclusive use of runways  taxiways and other facilities 
landing fees under these agreements are based on the number of landings and weight of the aircraft 
we are a party to a use and lease agreement as a signatory airline  for use of mccarran international airport for our operations in las vegas  nevada  which expires in june we have operational bases at airports at each of the major leisure destinations we serve 
in addition  we have an operational base in wendover  nevada to support our fixed fee flying under our agreement with peppermill resorts inc  and an operational base in bellingham  washington 
during  we established operational bases at oakland international airport and punta gorda airport  which required the leasing of additional facilities to support operations 
we served these airports prior to the establishment of these operational bases 
we use leased facilities at our operational bases to perform line maintenance  overnight parking of aircraft  and other operations support 
we lease additional space in cargo areas at the mccarran international airport and orlando sanford international airport for our primary line maintenance operations 
we also lease additional warehouse space in las vegas for aircraft parts and supplies

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of december  and investors should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the section entitled special note about forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
results during  we achieved our tenth straight profitable year  with net income of million or earnings per share diluted on operating revenues of million 
these net income and earnings per share results were both more than higher than  in which we ended with net income of million or earnings per share diluted on operating revenues of million 
our operating margin of for was driven by our highest ever annual ancillary revenue per passenger of  a increase compared to the prior year  and a year over year reduction in our non fuel unit costs of 
we grew our average number of aircraft in revenue service by from aircraft during to aircraft during the increase in average number of aircraft and the combination of increased seats in our md fleet  utilization of our boeing aircraft with seats and a increase in our scheduled service average stage length drove a increase in scheduled service asms year over year 
we experienced this asm production despite a year over year decline in our overall fleet average block hours per aircraft per day 
our total operating revenues in increased million or over due to a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in total average fare to 
we grew our ancillary revenue per passenger year over year by  which drove the increase in total average fare despite our flat scheduled service average base fare 
an increase in charges for bags resulting from the implementation of a new carry on bag fee and new boarding procedures was the main driver of our ancillary revenue per passenger increase 
our capacity growth  driven by an increase in our average number of aircraft and larger gauge aircraft  and a load factor year over year decline of percentage points  impacted our rasm which declined from in to in our load factor was negatively impacted during by expanded service to oakland san francisco bay area and our new service to hawaii 
our casm  excluding fuel  decreased from in to in  mainly attributable to a increase in system capacity which outpaced a increase in non fuel operating expenses 
drivers of improved casm  excluding fuel  were reduced engine repair expense in due to the completion of our engine overhaul program  better crew efficiency in and the impact of our variable pilot base pay scale 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and investment securities 
we were able to grow our unrestricted cash position during as cash generated by our operations more than covered investments in our fleet and information technology and payments to shareholders 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to return capital to shareholders 
we paid million in the form of a one time special cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record on november  and million to purchase company stock in the open market under our share repurchase program 
as of the end of  we are near completion of our md aircraft seat reconfiguration program which began during the third quarter of as of december   we had md aircraft with seats in revenue service 
the remaining six md aircraft  for a total of reconfigured aircraft  are expected to be in revenue service by the end of the first quarter of during  we also have made substantial progress on our automation projects including the transfer to our new website and distribution platform 
we successfully converted of our customer web traffic to our new booking engine in november although the enhancements to our technology infrastructure and development have required  and will continue to require significant capital investment  we believe these efforts will provide additional revenue opportunities by allowing us to capitalize on customer loyalty with additional product offerings 
in july  we implemented a cash discount to customers paying with debit cards in an effort to offer lower ticket prices and drive higher debit card usage to reduce our transaction costs 
the higher debit card usage contributed to lower transaction processing costs during aircraft operating fleet as of december   our total aircraft in service consisted of md aircraft and five boeing aircraft 
during  we placed two md aircraft into service which were previously held in storage and four boeing aircraft into service 
the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us as of the dates indicated as of december  as of december  as of december  own a b lease total b own a b lease c total b own a lease total md s mds d b total a does not include aircraft owned  but not added to our operating fleet as of the date indicated 
b includes md aircraft md s modified to a seat configuration 
these aircraft began to enter revenue service in the fourth quarter of we had reconfigured seat md aircraft as of december  and seven as of december  c in december  we exercised purchase options on two md aircraft and took ownership of these aircraft in january d used almost exclusively for fixed fee flying 
boeing aircraft not in service as of december   we owned six boeing aircraft  of which five aircraft were in revenue service at that time 
the remaining aircraft was being prepared for revenue service and was subsequently placed in service in january airbus aircraft in august  we entered into lease agreements for nine a aircraft with expected deliveries between the first quarter of and the second quarter of we accepted delivery of the first of these nine aircraft in january in december  we entered into purchase agreements for seven a aircraft 
we also intend to acquire an additional two a aircraft from one of the owners of the contracted for aircraft 
these a aircraft have commonality with the a aircraft we will lease  with use of the same engine type 
we expect to take delivery of the seven a aircraft under contract during with the additional two aircraft currently expected to be acquired in we expect seven of these aircraft will enter service in the airbus aircraft will be the third aircraft type in our operating fleet 
we are currently in the process of adding these airbus aircraft to our operating certificate and expect to place the first of these delivered aircraft into revenue service during the first half of refer to part i item properties for the expected number of operating aircraft at the end of future years which reflect the currently expected delivery of these airbus aircraft 
network as of december   we operate routes into our leisure destinations  including service from small cities  compared to routes from small cities as of december  during  we added two leisure destinations to our route network 
in june we began service to two leisure destinations in hawaii  with six routes to honolulu and one route to maui 
in addition to new leisure destinations  we experienced network growth from new routes involving existing leisure destinations 
in april  we established an operational base and expanded service at oakland international airport with seven new routes to serve the san francisco bay area 
with the addition of these seven new routes  we serve a total of nine routes into the san francisco bay area 
we have also established a base of operations at punta gorda florida with the expansion of service in june on four new routes into punta gorda 
with the addition of these four new routes  we serve a total of seven routes into punta gorda 
we have also increased routes to serve orlando  with as of december  compared to as of december   driven by profitability of our florida markets and identified opportunities for service from markets previously served by airtran which was discontinued after its acquisition by southwest 
the following shows the number of leisure destinations and small cities served as of the dates indicated includes cities served seasonally as of december  as of december  as of december  leisure destinations small cities served total cities served total routes trends and uncertainties although fuel cost volatility has significantly impacted our operating results in prior years  crude oil prices stabilized during  and we experienced a year over year increase of in our system average cost per gallon from to mainly driven by crack spread increases 
our fuel cost per asm declined in as the higher capacity boeing and additional seats from our md seat reconfiguration program provided us additional capacity over which to spread our fuel costs 
in comparison with  our asms per gallon of fuel increased in  as a result of the additional capacity from these seats 
as we introduce the airbus aircraft into revenue service in and after  we expect further increases in our asms per gallon of fuel as a result of fuel efficiency of this aircraft type 
fuel costs in the long term remain uncertain and fuel cost volatility would materially impact future operating costs 
in august  we received the results from the union vote of our pilots who have elected representation by the international brotherhood of teamsters  airline division 
we now have three employee groups which have voted for union representation  the other two being our flight attendants and flight dispatchers 
these three employee groups make up approximately of our total employees 
we are currently in various stages of negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement with the labor organizations for these employee groups 
during  we expect to receive deliveries of airbus a and a aircraft under the operating lease agreements and purchase agreements we entered into in we believe the introduction of these airbus aircraft into our operating fleet will provide a good fit for our existing business model 
when compared to our md aircraft  we believe the additional cost of ownership of these aircraft will be more than offset by cost savings from fuel efficiency and reduction in maintenance costs 
we incurred costs related to the introduction of the aircraft in the fourth quarter of and expect to incur additional training and pre operating costs in the first half of as we add the aircraft type to our operating certificate 
during  we announced the retirement of seven md aircraft  comprised of two seat md aircraft and five seat md aircraft which will not be reconfigured to seats 
the two md aircraft were dedicated to flying under a fixed fee agreement with caesars entertainment inc  which expired in december we believe the acquisition of the airbus aircraft under purchase agreements and operating lease agreements along with having six boeing aircraft in service will meet our aircraft needs to support our planned growth in and our network grew from total routes as of december   to total routes at december   and we have announced additional service to increase the number of routes to routes by the end of the first quarter of despite increased asms from our fleet growth and larger gauge aircraft  we expect to continue to aggressively manage capacity in our markets in an attempt to maintain acceptable loads and fares 
with our significant capacity growth in  our rasm was flat  but our casm  excluding fuel  declined by 
we expect our capacity growth in to continue to pressure our unit revenues and unit costs we are focused in the first half of on operating a higher percentage of our flights during peak windows and a lower percentage of flights during off peak windows 
we believe this approach with our planned departure and asm growth  primarily in our florida markets and our new hawaii service  will contribute to the achievement of our profitability goals in the current operating environment 
our operating revenue our operating revenue is comprised of both air travel on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotels  rental cars and other travel related services 
we believe our diversified revenue streams distinguish us from other us airlines and other travel companies 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue consists of base air fare for nonstop flights on our route network 
ancillary revenue 
our ancillary revenue is generated from air related charges and third party products 
air related revenue is generated through charges for checked or carry on bags  carrier usage charges  advance seat assignments  travel protection product with unlimited changes to nonrefundable itineraries  change fees  use of our call center for purchases  priority boarding and other services provided in conjunction with our scheduled air service 
we also generate revenue from third party products through the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website 
we recognize our ancillary revenues net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and payment processing fees 
fixed fee contract revenue 
our fixed fee contract revenue is generated from fixed fee agreements and charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis 
other revenue 
other revenue is primarily generated from aircraft and flight equipment leased to third parties 
seasonality 
our results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we can be adversely impacted during periods with reduced leisure travel spending 
traffic demand for our business historically has been weaker in the third quarter and stronger in the first quarter 
the expansion of our route network may produce some varying levels of seasonality from new leisure destinations  such as hawaii  where demand levels are typically weaker in the first quarter 
our operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expense line items follows 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of aircraft fuel  fuel taxes  into plane fees and airport fuel flowage  storage or through put fees 
under the majority of our fixed fee contracts  our customer reimburses us for fuel costs 
these amounts are netted against our fuel expense 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense includes wages  salaries  and employee bonuses  sales commissions for in flight personnel  as well as expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes 
station operations expense 
station operations expense includes the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities and fees charged by third party vendors for ground handling services  commissary expenses and other related services such as deicing of aircraft 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense includes all parts  materials and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
also included are fees for repairs performed by third party vendors 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense includes all advertising  promotional expenses  travel agent commissions and debit and credit card discount fees associated with the sale of scheduled service and air related charges 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense consists of the cost of leasing aircraft under operating leases with third parties 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft that we own and amortization of aircraft that we operated under capital leases 
other expense 
other expense includes the cost of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance and all other insurance policies except for employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes loss on disposals of aircraft and other equipment disposals  travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel  facility lease expenses  professional fees  personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
results of operations compared to the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the periods presented year ended december  total operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating margin operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in  up from million in  primarily due to a increase in ancillary revenue and a increase in scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service and ancillary revenue increases were driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in total average fare from to 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million for  up from million in the increase was primarily driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers as the scheduled service average base fare was relatively flat year over year 
passenger growth was driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service departures  as we increased the average number of aircraft in service by and we also added more seat md aircraft and boeing aircraft to our operating fleet 
scheduled service load factor declined by points from to as our increase in scheduled service asms outpaced our increase in scheduled service passengers 
the addition of routes to our florida markets were a significant driver of this year over year departure increase  as a result of profitability from these markets and identified opportunities for service from certain markets previously served by airtran which were discontinued after its acquisition by southwest 
the relatively flat year over year scheduled service average base fare was impacted by revenue softness we experienced in markets outside of florida  such as new markets where we have recently begun service 
ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million for  up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the increase in our ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger of was primarily attributable to the implementation of a new carry on bag fee in april and our new boarding process rolled out during the year 
the following table details ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from air related charges and third party products year ended december  percentage change air related charges third party products total ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger the following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products 
third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website year ended december  in thousands change gross ancillary revenue third party cost of goods sold transaction costs a ancillary revenue third party products as percent of gross ancillary revenue third party pp hotel room nights rental car days a includes payment expenses and travel agency commissions during  we generated gross revenue of million from the sale of third party products  which resulted in net revenue of million 
a major contributor to our increase in third party products net revenue was the sale of rental car days  which grew year over year and outpaced our scheduled service passenger growth of 
the increase in sale of rental car days was driven by an increase in scheduled service passengers to those markets where more rental car days are typically sold  such as florida and phoenix  and increased promotions with our national rental car operator 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue decreased to million in  down from million in the decrease was the result of a reduction in total fixed fee block hours flown of  offset by a increase in our per block hour rate 
the reduction in block hours flown was driven by our decision to reduce the availability of aircraft for ad hoc flying compared to the prior year 
we typically seek out additional ad hoc flying during periods when aircraft are not utilized for scheduled service flying 
with the expiration of the caesars contract in december  we expect significantly lower fixed fee revenue at the current time 
other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million for  compared to million in the same period of  primarily from lease revenue for aircraft and flight equipment 
in the first quarter of  we leased three boeing aircraft to third parties on a short term basis 
during  these aircraft were returned to us  one in the second quarter and two in the fourth quarter 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased only to million in compared to million in despite a increase in system capacity 
we primarily evaluate our expense management by comparing our costs per passenger and per asms across different periods which enable us to assess trends in each expense category 
the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods per passenger costs 
the table also presents operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by the number of passengers carried 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel the following table presents unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods 
the table also presents operating casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by available seat miles 
as on a per passenger basis  excluding fuel on a per asm basis provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased million  or  to million for  up from million this change was due to a increase in system gallons consumed from million to million  and a increase in our average total system fuel cost per gallon from to 
the increase in gallons consumed is attributable to an increase in our total system departures  our larger gauge aircraft and a increase in total system average stage length 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million for  up from million in excluding accrued employee bonus expense and stock compensation expense  salary and benefits expense increased only attributable to a increase in the number of full time equivalent employees 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased from  at december   to  at december   to support the growth of our aircraft fleet  our ongoing significant information technology enhancements and other company growth activities 
these increases were offset by improved crew efficiency in and the impact of our variable pilot base pay scale 
in addition  our accrued employee bonus expense increased in as a result of the year over year increase in operating income 
our increased profitability in will also contribute to higher pilot pay in station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million for  compared to million in the same period of  as a result of an increase in system departures and an increase in station operations expense per departure 
the increase in station operations expense per departure was attributable to increased fees at several airports where we operate  primarily las vegas  and the outsourcing of our station operations in las vegas beginning in may maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense decreased to million for  compared to million in despite a increase in average number of aircraft in service and a increase in system asms 
we incurred million more in engine overhaul expenses during as a result of our engine overhaul program  in which we made a substantial investment to increase the reliability and reduce the overall age of our engine portfolio 
the decrease in engine overhaul expenses in was offset by an increase in heavy airframe checks  repair of rotable parts and usage of expendable parts associated with our aircraft fleet growth 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense decreased to million in compared to million for the same period of despite a increase in scheduled service revenue 
sales and marketing expense per passenger declined from to primarily due to lower advertising expenses and a reduction in payment processing costs per passenger attributable to increased debit card usage 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
we had no aircraft lease rentals expense in  compared to million in in december  we exercised purchased options on two of our md aircraft under operating leases and took ownership of the aircraft in january upon taking ownership of these two aircraft in january  we did not have any aircraft under operating leases during depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by a increase in the average number of operating aircraft  the md seat reconfiguration costs  and the acceleration of depreciation from a change in estimated remaining useful lives for a limited number of md aircraft we expect to retire in as of december   we owned aircraft in service including five boeing aircraft and md aircraft reconfigured to seats compared to aircraft in service including one boeing aircraft and seven md aircraft reconfigured to seats at december  other expense 
other expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by an increase in pre operating expenses related to certification of our a and a series aircraft and other administrative costs associated with our growth 
other income expense other income expense increased from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the increase is due to a million increase in interest expense in primarily associated with our million term loan borrowing in march income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the higher effective tax rate for was largely due to the impact of apportionment factor adjustments to filed state income tax returns which contributed to an increase in our state income tax expense 
while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates 
compared to the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the periods presented year ended december  total operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating margin operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in primarily driven by a increase in our total average fare from to and a increase in scheduled service passengers 
we believe stronger travel demand  changes in our pricing strategy and aggressive capacity management contributed to the improvement in total average fare 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million for  up from million in the increase was primarily driven by a increase in the average base fare for compared to  along with a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers 
the significant increase in average base fare was achieved despite a increase in capacity 
passenger growth was driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service departures and a slight increase in scheduled service load factor  up almost one percentage point to for ancillary revenue

third party products increased on a per passenger basis primarily as a result of increased hotel room bookings and margin expansion  when compared to the prior year 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue increased to million during from million for the increase in fixed fee contract revenue was primarily attributable to flying under an agreement with peppermill resorts inc flying began in january  which more than offset the reduction in fixed fee flying under the caesars entertainment inc caesars agreement 
block hours flown under our fixed fee flying agreement with caesars decreased from  block hours in to  in other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million for compared to million for  primarily from lease revenue for aircraft and flight equipment 
in the first quarter of  we leased three boeing aircraft to third parties on a short term basis 
during  these aircraft were returned to us  one in the second quarter and two in the fourth quarter 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased to million for compared to million in the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel the following table presents unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm for the indicated periods 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel our casm  excluding fuel  increased  primarily from increases in maintenance and repairs expense  salaries and benefits expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
lower aircraft utilization inherent in our capacity management plan for the period and a decrease in system average stage length contributed to the increase in casm excluding fuel as increasing total costs were spread over only a slightly higher number of asms compared to the prior year 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased million or to million for  up from million in  primarily driven by a increase in the system average cost per gallon from to 
in addition  the expansion of crack spreads for jet fuel continued to impact our system average cost per gallon during salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million in up from million in  due to a increase in our salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employee 
the increase in our salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employee was driven by our new pilot and flight attendant compensation agreements which went into effect in may and july  respectively 
the number of full time equivalent employees decreased from  as of december  to  as of december   with the outsourcing of our station operations in las vegas beginning in may resulting in this decrease 
station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in as a result of a increase in station operations expense per departure and a increase in system departures 
the increase in station operations expense per departure was attributable to increases in ground handling fees at several airports where we operate  along with outsourcing of our station operations in las vegas beginning in may maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased to million for compared to million in the increase was primarily a result of increased engine overhauls of million during compared to the prior year 
increases in the repair of rotable parts and usage of expendable parts associated with an increase in average number of our aircraft in service from in to for also contributed to our increased maintenance and repairs expense 
the increase in engine overhauls and repairs was driven by a new md engine maintenance strategy which began in late prior to that  fewer engine overhauls were performed and instead were replaced with engines acquired in the secondary market 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in due to higher credit card transaction costs associated with the increase in scheduled service and ancillary revenue and an increase in advertising expenses driven by entrance into new markets 
aircraft lease rentals expense

depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of primarily driven by additional depreciation expense from boeing and md aircraft and engines 
our boeing aircraft include three aircraft leased to third parties during and one placed into revenue service in july we ended with aircraft in service as compared to aircraft at the end of other expense 
other expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by losses associated with one md aircraft we permanently grounded during the second quarter of  the disposal of one engine  along with the write down of engine values in our consignment program 
in addition  we had an increase in our administrative expenses associated with our growth  such as property taxes and software support  which contributed to the overall increase in other operating expenses 
other income expense other income expense increased from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the increase is due to a million increase in interest expense in primarily associated with our million term loan borrowing in march income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the higher effective tax rate for was largely due to the impact of apportionment factor adjustments to filed state income tax returns which contributed to an increase in our state income tax expense 
while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources during  our primary source of funds was cash generated by our operations 
our operating cash flows along with the proceeds of million senior secured term loan facility in term loan have allowed us to invest in the growth of our fleet  information technology infrastructure and development  while meeting our short term obligations  returning cash to our stockholders and growing our cash position 
our future capital needs are primarily for the acquisition of additional aircraft with our recently announced intention 
as of december   we had million of obligations under existing aircraft purchase agreements and million of obligations under existing aircraft operating lease agreements 
we believe we have more than adequate liquidity resources through our operating cash flows and cash balances to meet our future contractual obligations 
as we have done in the past  we consider raising funds through debt financing on acceptable terms from time to time 
current liquidity cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investment securities short term and long term totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
restricted cash represents escrowed funds under fixed fee contracts  cash collateral against notes payable and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel properties for guaranteed room availability  airports and certain other parties 
investment securities represent highly liquid marketable securities which are available for sale 
under our fixed fee flying contracts  we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us 
the prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed 
prepayments are recorded as restricted cash and a corresponding amount is recorded as air traffic liability 
our restricted cash balance declined from million as of december  to million at december  primarily as a result of lower escrowed funds for fixed fee contracts 
the lower prepayment held in escrow was driven by the expiration of our fixed fee flying agreement with caesars entertainment inc in december sources and uses of cash operating activities 
during  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million during as net income in increased million over net income in the cash flows provided by operations for were primarily the result of net income and increase in air traffic liability which results from passenger bookings for future travel 
in addition  as non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense reduce our net income without requiring current cash expenditure  the million increase in that item from to also contributed to the increased cash flow from operations 
during  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million during the higher cash provided by operating activities in compared to  was driven by cash used in by the prepayment of million for access to hotel rooms for sale through an agreement with one of our key las vegas partners and an increase in deferred income taxes

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
revenue recognition 
scheduled service revenue consists of passenger revenue generated from limited frequency nonstop flights in our route network recognized when the travel related service or transportation is provided or when the itinerary expires unused 
nonrefundable scheduled itineraries expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer in advance 
itineraries sold for transportation  but not yet used  as well as unexpired credits  are included in air traffic liability 
various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities 
these taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority 
fixed fee contract revenue consists of agreements to provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis 
fixed fee contract revenue is recognized when the transportation is provided 
ancillary revenue consists of passenger revenue from air related charges and sale of third party products 
air related charges include optional services provided to passengers such as baggage fees  the use of our website to purchase scheduled service transportation  advance seat assignments and other services 
revenues from air related charges are recognized when the transportation is provided if the product is not deemed independent of the original ticket sale 
fees imposed on passengers making changes and cancellations to nonrefundable itineraries are air related charges deemed independent of the original ticket sale 
therefore  revenues from change fees or cancellation fees are recognized as they occur 
ancillary revenue is also generated from the sale of third party products such as hotel rooms  rental cars  ticket attractions and other items 
revenues from the sale of third party products are recognized at the time the product is utilized  such as the time a purchased hotel room is occupied 
the amount of revenues attributed to each element of a bundled sale involving air related charges and third party products in addition to airfare is determined in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the sale of third party products is recorded net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and transaction costs in accordance with revenue reporting accounting standards 
other revenue is generated from leased out aircraft and flight equipment and other miscellaneous sources 
lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
accounting for long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations  consisting principally of property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in operations  and estimated salvage values 
in estimating the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types  current and projected future market information  and recommendations from aircraft manufacturers 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changing market prices of our aircraft  changes in utilization of the aircraft and other fleet events 
we evaluate these estimates used for each reporting period and  when deemed necessary  adjust these estimates 
to the extent a change in estimate for useful lives or salvage values of our property and equipment occurs  there could result an acceleration of depreciation expense associated with the change in estimate 
aircraft maintenance and repair costs 
we account for aircraft maintenance activities under the direct expense method 
under this method  maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft  including major aircraft maintenance activities  are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
as a lessee  we may be required under provisions of our lease agreements to make payments to the lessor in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities 
these payments of maintenance deposits are calculated based on a performance measure  such as flight hours or cycles  and are available for reimbursement to us upon the completion of the maintenance of the leased aircraft 
accounting guidance for maintenance deposits requires these payments to be accounted for as an asset until reimbursed for incurred maintenance costs or until it is determined that any portion of the estimated total of the deposit is less than probable of being returned 
we had no maintenance deposits as of december  or december  investment securities 
we maintain a liquid portfolio of investment securities available for current operations and to satisfy on going obligations 
we have classified these investments as available for sale and accordingly  unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
stock based compensation 
we issued stock based awards  including restricted stock  stock options and stock appreciation rights sars to certain officers  directors  employees and consultants 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using a fair value approach 
determining the fair value requires judgment  and we use the black scholes valuation model for stock options and sars issued 
cash settled sars are liability based awards and fair value is updated each reporting period using the black scholes valuation model for outstanding awards 
significant judgment is required to establish the assumptions to be used in the black scholes valuation model 
these assumptions are for the volatility of our common stock  estimated term over which our stock options and sars will be outstanding  and interest rate to be applied 
expected volatilities used were based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
expected term represents the weighted average time between the award s grant date and its exercise date 
we estimated our expected term assumption using historical award exercise activity and employee termination activity 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the expected term of the award is based on a blended historical rate using federal reserve rates for us treasury securities 
we use our closing share price on the grant date as the fair value for issuances of restricted stock
