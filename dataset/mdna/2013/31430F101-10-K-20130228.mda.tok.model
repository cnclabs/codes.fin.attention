d a more detailed description and computation of adjusted ffo per share and adjusted ebitda is contained in the non gaap financial measures section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations strong demand and benign supply growth has created a favorable dynamic to improve average daily rate  or adr  which drove growth in revenue per available room  or revpar 
in  our revpar improved  compared to the prior year  and adr grew  while occupancy declined as we remixed our customer base in favor of higher rated segments 
sustained adr growth allows our hotels to improve hotel ebitda margins up basis points  compared to the prior year 
in  we made critical progress toward achieving our strategic objectives in december  we amended and restated our million secured line of credit facility 
the facility now matures in june extended from august  including a one year extension option  subject to certain conditions 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor no floor plus reduced from libor plus 
the unused commitment fee decreased basis points 
the facility is secured by mortgages and related security interests on eight hotels 
in december  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due  significantly reducing our cost of borrowing 
we used the proceeds to redeem million in aggregate face amount of senior notes due and repay a million mortgage loan with the remaining proceeds used to repay a portion of the balance on our outstanding line of credit and to pay prepayment costs and other expenses 
with this offering  we have effectively completed the capital markets portion of restructuring our balance sheet 
we expect to repay the remaining million of our notes and other mortgage debt using proceeds from future asset sales 
we have sold hotels since december including hotels in for total gross proceeds of million our pro rata share of which was million 
we used million of asset sale proceeds to repay indebtedness 
we paid all outstanding accrued preferred dividends million in we raised million in proceeds from five single asset mortgage loans that closed in september  and bear an average interest rate of 
proceeds from these loans were used to repay a million  mortgage loan that would have matured in we also repaid the remaining million balance of a mortgage loan using excess proceeds from the new loans  as well as recent asset sale proceeds 
we are redeveloping the landmark knickerbocker hotel in midtown manhattan which we acquired in december for million  as a four plus star hotel featuring large guest rooms  a rooftop sky bar and lounge directly overlooking times square  state of the art meeting space and a full service fitness center 
in november  we obtained an million construction loan to finance the project and expect to obtain additional five year financing through the eb visa program 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures  including renovation and redevelopment on our operating hotels 
during this time  we completed renovations at seven hotels 
we also completed redevelopment projects at two properties  the embassy suites myrtle beach oceanfront resort and the fairmont copley plaza 
the fairmont copley plaza redevelopment repositioned the hotel closer to its luxury competitors and included a complete renovation of rooms and corridors  upgrading rooms to fairmont gold  adding a new rooftop fitness center and spa  and redeveloping the food and beverage and other public areas

financial comparison hotel ebitda and loss from continuing operations in millions year ended december  change change revpar a hotel ebitda a b hotel ebitda margin a b loss from continuing operations c a all years presented are for our same store consolidated hotels 
b hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures 
a discussion of the use  limitations and importance of these non gaap financial measures and detailed reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are found elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section non gaap financial measures 
c the following amounts are included in loss from continuing operations in millions year ended december  impairment loss hurricane loss debt extinguishment conversion expenses severance expenses results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a million net loss compared to a million net loss in our net loss included million of conversion costs related to re branding and re positioning eight hotels  a million loss from the extinguishment of debt million in continuing operations and  in discontinued operations and million of impairment charges included in discontinued operations 
these losses are partially offset by million of net gains from hotel dispositions which are included in discontinued operations

in total revenue was million  more than this increase was primarily driven by a increase in same store revpar reflecting a increase in adr partially offset by a basis point decrease in occupancy  as well as million in incremental revenue from royalton and morgans  acquired in may several of our core hotels were under significant renovation or redevelopment during hotel departmental expenses increased million including million of incremental hotel departmental expenses at royalton and morgans 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses decreased slightly from in to in improved adr was offset  in part  by decreasing food and beverage margins 
other property related costs increased million due to a combination of higher costs such as marketing programs and million of incremental other property related costs at royalton and morgans 
as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs decreased from to compared to this improvement primarily reflects revenue increases driven by adr as opposed to occupancy 
management and franchise fees increased million compared to  primarily reflecting higher revenues which serve as the basis for determining such fees 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs remained essentially unchanged from the same period in taxes  insurance and lease expense increased million including  of incremental taxes  insurance  and lease expenses at royalton and morgans and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to compared to the higher percentage of revenue reflects more favorable liability claims in in addition to lower estimated canadian taxes in corporate expenses decreased million decreasing as a percentage of total revenue from to  which reflects i lower restricted stock amortization in  as a significant amount of restricted stock vested in  and ii lower payroll tax withholding with respect to restricted cash awards  which were lower in than in we recognize payroll tax withholding on these awards as an expense when awarded rather than amortizing that expense over the three year vesting periods as is the case with the remainder of the awards 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to  including million of incremental depreciation expense related to royalton and morgans 
the remainder of the increase primarily reflects depreciation associated with hotel capital expenditures of million in and million in impairment loss 
at december   no impairment charges were included in continuing operations  while continuing operations included a million charge for one hotel 
that charge was based on a revised estimated fair value obtained through the marketing process that was lower than the net book value for that hotel 
conversion expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to convert eight holiday inn hotels to the wyndham hotels resorts brand and management effective march  the expenses incurred related to converting these hotels have been classified as conversion expenses in our statements of operations and include million of ihg termination fees for the year ended december  other expenses increased  compared to  because of hurricane related charges and other expenses  offset by lower acquisition costs 
net interest expense decreased million compared to  which primarily reflects increased capitalized interest related to the knickerbocker hotel development  which was partially offset by an increase in our average effective interest rate 
debt extinguishment charges during the year ended december  were million 
these charges include million of prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred loan costs primarily related to repaying million in mortgage debt secured by properties in continuing operations 
in addition  we redeemed million of our senior notes and recognized a million debt extinguishment charge related to prepayment penalties  and the write off of a pro rata portion of the original issue discount and deferred loan costs 
during the year ended december   we redeemed million of our senior notes and recognized a million debt extinguishment charge related to prepayment penalties  and the write off of a pro rata portion of the original issue discount and deferred loan costs 
discontinued operations include the results of operations for ten hotels sold in discontinued operations in include results of operations for eight hotels sold that year and the ten hotels sold in discontinued operations in included a million net gain on the sale of hotels in addition to million in impairment charges 
discontinued operations in reflects a million net gain on the sale of hotels  million in net gains from debt extinguishment and million in impairment charges

in total revenue was million  a increase compared to the increase was primarily driven by a increase in same store revpar at our core hotels and at our non strategic hotels  which was driven by a increase in adr and a increase in occupancy  as well as million in incremental revenue from our recently acquired hotels the fairmont copley plaza  acquired in august  and royalton and morgans  acquired in may 
hotel departmental expenses increased million  compared to  reflecting improved occupancy and million of incremental hotel departmental expense at our recently acquired hotels 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from in to in this change is primarily due to the mix and nature of the business at the fairmont copley plaza  which has significant food and beverage revenue 
food and beverage expenses are generally much higher as a percent of revenue than room expenses 
other property related costs increased million  compared to  due to a combination of improved occupancy and million of incremental other property related costs from our recently acquired hotels 
as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs remained essentially unchanged compared to management and franchise fees increased million  compared to  due to higher revenues which serve as the basis for determining such fees and  in fees with respect of our recently acquired hotels 
as a percent of total revenue  management and franchise fees remained essentially unchanged compared to taxes  insurance and lease expenses increased million compared to as a percentage of total revenue  taxes  insurance and lease expense improved from in to in this trend reflects favorable property tax settlements and improved liability claims experience  and was partially offset by million of incremental expenses at our recently acquired hotels 
corporate expenses decreased million and decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
this decrease is primarily attributed to the decrease in corporate bonus expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to this change was driven by an increase in hotel capital expenditures  in addition to million of depreciation expense related to our recently acquired hotels 
offsetting this increase is a reduction to depreciation expense resulting from a decline in certain asset values 
our asset values  the basis from which we calculate depreciation  declined between and as a result of hotel sales and impairment charges 
as a percent of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to in compared to in impairment charges 
we had an impairment charge of million in relating to one hotel that we are currently marketing for sale 
the charge was based on a revised estimated fair value obtained through the marketing process that was lower than the net book value 
in  we had impairment charges of million included in continuing operations  relating to six non strategic hotels 
net interest expense decreased million compared to  primarily reflecting our lower average debt 
extinguishment of debt 
during  we redeemed million of our senior notes due in october and recognized a million debt extinguishment charge related to the prepayment premium and the write off of a pro rata portion of the original issue discount and deferred loan costs 
in june  we repaid million of debt  secured by two hotels  for million  and recorded a related million gain on extinguishment of debt 
this gain was partially offset by a loss from debt extinguishment of approximately million resulting from the retirement of million of our senior notes which were due june equity in income from unconsolidated entities was a loss of million compared to million of income in in  we had a million gain from the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated entity  which owned the sheraton premiere hotel in tysons corner  virginia

these charges were partially offset by a million gain from debt extinguishment related to the two hotels transferred to lenders in satisfaction of debt 
non gaap financial measures we refer in this annual report to certain non gaap financial measures 
these measures  including ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the following tables reconcile these non gaap measures to felcor s most comparable gaap financial measure 
immediately following the reconciliations  we include a discussion of why we believe these measures are useful supplemental measures of our performance and of the limitations upon such measures

the offsetting percentage lease revenue is included in equity in income from unconsolidated entities 
substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
these supplemental measures are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a hotel reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income loss attributable to felcor as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income or loss attributable to parent computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 
ffo for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss attributable to parent computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
adjustments to ffo and ebitda we adjust ffo and ebitda when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items  including but not limited to the below  provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ffo  and adjusted ebitda when combined with gaap net income attributable to felcor  ebitda and ffo  is beneficial to an investor s better understanding of our operating performance 
gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps we exclude gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps from ffo and ebitda because we believe that it is not indicative of ongoing operating performance of our hotel assets 
this also represents an acceleration of interest expense or a reduction of interest expense  and interest expense is excluded from ebitda 
in addition  to derive adjusted ebitda we exclude gains or losses on the sale of depreciable assets and impairment losses because we believe that including them in ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
additionally  the gain or loss on sale of depreciable assets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods  and depreciation is excluded from ebitda 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and brand managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures that we use in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating all revenues and expenses from continuing operations not directly associated with hotel operations  including corporate level expenses  depreciation and amortization  and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our assets 
we also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by noncontrolling interests and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our consolidated hotels 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margins are presented on a same store basis 
use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
these non gaap financial measures as presented by us  may not be comparable to non gaap financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
these non gaap financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   we generated million of cash provided by operating activities primarily from hotel operations  a million increase compared to our consolidated statements of cash flows combine cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations 
we had million  million and million of operating cash flow from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the absence of these cash flows should not have a material impact on our business  as these hotels would not provide an acceptable return on future capital expenditure required for these hotels 
at december   we had million of cash  including approximately million held by our third party management companies 
revpar for the lodging industry continues to be strong 
revpar at our hotels for grew  driven by a increase in adr  which was offset by lower occupancy  due to renovation related disruption in the first part of the industry is enjoying a favorable supply demand imbalance  as supply growth remains well below the long term average 
occupancy continues to grow and is approaching prior peak levels  allowing hotels to raise rates 
we expect our revpar to increase to during  primarily from higher adr 
we expect to generate million to million of cash flow from operating activities in we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
some of these operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which lends volatility to our operating results 
we have implemented extensive cost containment initiatives at our hotels  including reducing headcount and improving productivity and energy efficiency 
if revpar decreases  or fails to grow in line with or better than occupancy  and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
investing activities during  investing activities generated million of cash compared to million of cash invested during the same period in in  we sold hotels for million in net proceeds  which was partially offset by million of capital expenditures primarily for renovations and redevelopment at hotels and million of capital expenditures at the knickerbocker hotel 
in  we purchased two hotels for million  spent million in capital expenditures and spent million to acquire and develop the knickerbocker hotel  all of which was partially offset by million of net proceeds from hotel sales 
we expect to spend approximately million for renovations and redevelopment in  which will be funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and borrowings under our line of credit 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million in at the knickerbocker hotel  which will be funded primarily by cash  draws on the knickerbocker construction loan and five year financing that is currently being raised through the eb visa program 
our strategic plan contemplates that we will sell non strategic hotels that do not meet our investment criteria  thereby freeing our capital for redeployment eg  repay debt and invest in our core properties that generate a higher return on invested capital 
we have sold of these hotels to date  including in  and we have non strategic hotels remaining to sell 
as of january  we are marketing of the remaining hotels 
the other nine non strategic hotels are held in joint ventures  and we and our partners are analyzing the best timing to begin marketing those properties 
financing activities during  cash from financing activities decreased by million compared to in  we had million of net debt payments including repayment of million in face amount of our senior notes  and paid million in preferred dividends  partially offset by million of net borrowings under our line of credit and million in proceeds from our senior secured notes due in  we had million in proceeds from issuing our senior secured notes due and million in proceeds from the sale of common stock  partially offset by million of net debt payments including repayment of million in face amount of our senior notes and million of preferred dividends 
in  we expect to pay approximately million of normally occurring principal payments and million of preferred dividends  all of which will be funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
we are using proceeds from hotel sales to make additional non recurring principal payments 
in september  we obtained million in proceeds from five single asset ten year mortgage loans 
proceeds from the new loans were used to repay million on a mortgage loan that would otherwise mature in  and  together with asset sale proceeds  repay the remaining million balance of another mortgage loan 
the average fixed interest rate on the new loans is over basis points lower than the repaid loan  and we were able to unencumber seven hotels 
in november  we obtained an million construction loan secured by the knickerbocker hotel 
the construction loan will mature in  assuming exercise of a one year extension option 
when the loan closed  we drew million to repay a million mortgage loan we assumed when we purchased the building 
that initial draw  which bears interest at libor plus basis points  is also secured by million of cash collateral 
we will draw from the cash collateral until it is depleted which we estimate will occur in the second half of prior to drawing any additional funds under the construction loan 
any funds drawn under the construction loan not secured by cash collateral bear interest at libor plus basis points 
the loan will be used to fund some of the cost to redevelop the knickerbocker 
in addition  some of the redevelopment costs will be funded with five year financing that is currently being raised through the eb visa program 
in december  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due  significantly reducing our cost of borrowing and extending our maturity profile 
we used the proceeds to redeem million in aggregate face amount of senior notes due  repay a million mortgage loan otherwise due in with the remaining proceeds used to repay a portion of the balance on our outstanding line of credit and to pay prepayment costs and other expenses 
in december  we amended and restated our million secured line of credit facility 
the facility now matures in june extended from august  assuming exercise of a one year extension option 
borrowings bear interest at libor no floor plus reduced from libor plus 
the unused commitment fee decreased basis points to basis points 
the facility is secured by mortgages and related security interests on eight hotels 
in  we reinstated the payment of our current quarterly preferred dividends 
we had million of aggregate accrued dividends payable to holders of our series a and series c preferred stock at december  including million of accrued current dividends that were paid in january in july  we paid million of accrued dividends in arrears  and the remaining million was paid in october except in the case of our senior notes and line of credit  our mortgage debt is generally recourse solely to the specific hotels securing the debt  except in case of fraud  misapplication of funds and certain other customary limited recourse carve out provisions  which could extend recourse to us 
much of our secured debt allows us to substitute collateral under certain conditions and is prepayable  subject in some instances to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
most of our secured debt other than our senior notes and line of credit includes lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
we are permitted to spend an amount required to cover our budgeted hotel operating expenses  taxes  debt service  insurance and capital expenditure reserves even if revenues are flowing through a lock box in cases where a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
with the exception of loans secured by two properties  all of our consolidated loans subject to lock box provisions currently exceed the applicable minimum debt service coverage ratios 
senior notes 
our senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to i incur additional indebtedness  except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  ii pay dividends in excess of the minimum distributions required to qualify as a reit  iii repurchase capital stock  or iv merge 
we currently exceed all minimum thresholds 
these notes are guaranteed by us  and payment of our notes is secured by a pledge of the limited partner interests in felcor lp owned by felcor 
in addition  our senior notes are secured by a combination of first lien mortgages and related security interests and or negative pledges on hotels hotels for our senior notes  six hotels for our senior notes and ten hotels for our senior notes  and pledges of equity interests in certain subsidiaries of felcor lp 
interest rate caps 
to fulfill requirements under certain loans  we entered into interest rate cap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these interest rate caps were not designated as hedges and had insignificant fair values at both december  and  resulting in no significant net earnings impact 
consolidated debt consisted of the following in thousands encumbered hotels interest rate december  maturity date line of credit l june a hotel mortgage debt mortgage debt b june august mortgage debt july mortgage debt b october mortgage debt october senior notes senior secured notes c october senior secured notes june senior secured notes march other d l may retired debt total a our million line of credit can be extended for one year to  subject to satisfying certain conditions 
b this debt is comprised of separate non cross collateralized loans each secured by a mortgage of a different hotel 
c we originally issued million face amount of these notes 
after redemptions in and  million face amount of these notes were outstanding at december  these notes were initially sold at a discount that provided an effective yield of before transaction costs 
d this loan is related to our knickerbocker development project and is fully secured by restricted cash and a mortgage 
because we were able to assume an existing loan when we purchased this hotel  we were not required to pay any local mortgage recording tax 
this loan can be extended for one year subject to satisfying certain conditions 
contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make certain future payments under debt agreements and various contracts 
the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years after years debt a operating leases purchase obligations ihg termination fees accrued obligations on sold hotels total contractual obligations a this includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using interest rates at december  off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that owned hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures 
we own more than of the operating lessees operating of these hotels and one hotel is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to these hotels  of which our pro rata portion was million  none of which is reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to guarantees of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income from unconsolidated entities of million  a loss of million  and income of million including million of gains from sale for  and  respectively 
we received million of distributions of which million came from operations  million of which million came from operations  and million of which million came from operations in  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from the operating lessees 
capital expenditures at the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally funded from operating income at their hotels 
however  if a joint venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  it may call capital from the venturers 
in the event of a capital call  the other joint venturer may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make up the difference as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to joint ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by them could perform below expectations and result in insolvency of the partnership and acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we make many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which include the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holding periods  expected remaining useful lives of assets  estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and future capital expenditures 
we record an impairment charge when one or more of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries experiences an other than temporary decline in fair value 
any decline in fair value that is not expected to be recovered in the next months is considered other than temporary 
we record an impairment in our equity based investments as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
our estimates of fair values are based on future cash flow estimates  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of our hotels or investments in unconsolidated entities  thereby requiring future impairment charges 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  property insurance and employee costs related to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
in  and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of such costs 
we make estimates with regard to when components of the renovated asset or redevelopment project are taken out of service or placed in service when determining the appropriate amount and time to capitalize these costs 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we could capitalize too much or too little with regard to a particular project 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets  and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation and amortization expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
investments in hotel properties are based on purchase price and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value 
any remaining unallocated purchase price  if any  is treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value  based on current replacement cost for similar capacity  and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations prepared by management and or independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources such as those obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million at december  we recorded a valuation allowance related to our trss net deferred tax asset  because of the uncertainty of realizing the asset s benefit 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   approximately of our consolidated debt had fixed interest rates 
in some cases  market rates of interest are below the rates we are obligated to pay on our fixed rate debt 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the tables present scheduled maturities before extension options and weighted average interest rates  by maturity dates
