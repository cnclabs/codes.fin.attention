these products are targeted throughout the telecommunication network from radio access network ran to the evolved packet core epc to the ip mulitmedia subsystem ims 
our mrf  an application built on atca platforms  provides audio conferencing  volte  and video conferencing functions into the network ims 
additionally  when these products are combined with our professional service organization of network experts we can enable our customers to bring to market solutions such as security  femto  and lte gateways  edge routers and load balancers that are critical elements within the networks at a cost and time to market advantage when compared to internally developed solutions 
our trillium software is the foundation for a complete turn key application for small cells in both the g and lte ran 
atca and network appliance products are the platforms necessary to control and move data in the network core  as well as applications such as deep packet inspection dpi and policy management 
in july we acquired continuous computing corporation continuous computing a developer of communications systems consisting of highly integrated atca platforms and trillium protocol software coupled with professional services to enable a full solution offering 
continuous computing key customer applications included g and g wireless infrastructure  small cell base stations  traffic management  internet offload and network security 
the acquisition accelerated the company strategy to deliver more differentiated platforms and solutions 
highlights our business experienced challenges throughout due to an overall decline in telecom infrastructure spending  resulting in decreased volumes and downward pricing pressure specifically within our platforms products 
despite the challenging telecom market  we increased deployment of our software solutions products  specifically mrf  as our customers continue to invest in upgrading audio conferencing capabilities within their networks 
during we introduced a number of key products which are expected to drive our future growth 
these products included our g t series atca products  fully integrated platforms that decrease our customers delivery costs while increasing performance  and our new mpx mrf which enables volte capabilities for wireless carriers 
operationally during we completed many of the planned actions undertaken in intended to reduce our overall cost structure and enable more efficient product development and product integration following our acquisition of continuous computing in july these actions included the consolidation to one contract manufacturer  the transition of atca and software solutions research and development teams to our offshore development centers in china and india 
these transitions included the fit out of new facilities in each location  the transition and consolidation of our general and administrative supporting functions to better align with the new business structure  and the downsizing of our north america facilities to smaller footprints in each location as we have transitioned certain functions to lower cost geographies 
following are the more significant highlights and developments within our business for the year ended december  revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline was caused by an expected decrease in revenue from our other products product group as these products continue to trend towards end of life as our largest customer transitions to atca platforms 
this decrease was offset by increased revenue in our atca and software solutions product groups resulting from the acquisition of continuous computing and increased deployments of our mrf products 
our gross margin increased percentage points in the year ended december  to of revenue from of revenue in the year ended december  increased revenue in our higher margin software solutions and atca product groups  decreased revenues from our low margin other products  and our continued focus on controlling manufacturing spend contributed to the increase in gross margin in as compared to r d expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of additional development costs related to our g t series atca and mpx products 
sg a expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of a reduction in headcount and overhead expenses resulting from restructuring activities associated with our acquisition of continuous computing 
additionally  decreased sales as compared to the year ended december  resulted in lower commission expense 
during  we recorded the following non recurring charges associated with our operations million goodwill impairment charge resulting from a decline in the trading value of our common stock coupled with a downturn in the telecommunications market  million in restructuring charges largely associated with the departure of certain executive officers  workforce reductions resulting from our acquisition of continuous computing and facility abandonments 
as of december   these integration activities are substantially complete  and million gain associated with the partial reversal of our contingent consideration liability resulting from the continued delay in our customers small cell deployments 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to the repurchase of million of our senior convertible notes  million in capital expenditures associated with the build out of our international facilities  continued integration related activities associated with the acquisition of continuous computing and the addition of g atca test equipment 
additionally  million of restructuring costs  primarily related to the acquisition of continuous computing  were paid during these cash outflows were offset by cash flows from operations  excluding payments for restructuring activities  of million 
outlook we are cautiously optimistic that the modestly improving market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of will continue throughout although overall revenue is expected to remain relatively consistent with  we expect continued growth in our higher margin atca and software solutions products as the telecom markets recover from the downturn in capital spending 
additionally  we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected recovery of telecom markets as we enter with a complete portfolio of g t series atca assets available for sale to our customers and have introduced our new mpx mrf product to address the increasing demand of volte services

we expect continued growth in our atca product group as the telecom market capital spending recovers in we continue to expect long term revenue growth in our atca product group as our recent design wins ramp to customer deployment and the introduction of our g t series atca platforms which began shipping in the second half of for  revenues in the atca product group increased million to million in from million in increased revenues from our atca product group were due to a million increase in revenues from increased g and g lte infrastructure deployments  the continued migration within our largest customer from legacy products  and a significant last time buy of older generation atca products 
in addition  our acquisition of continuous computing contributed an increase of million over revenues 
software solutions revenues in the software solutions product group increased million to million in from million in robust demand for our mrf products  targeted at the audio conferencing market  led to increased deployments throughout our customer base when compared to additionally  trillium software products were added to our revenue profile in july as a result of the acquisition of continuous computing  and contributed to a million increase during the first half of these increases were offset by slower than expected trillium based small cell deployments as the adoption of small cell technology in next generation networks has been slower than we anticipated 
we expect software solutions long term revenue growth of given an expected increase in demand for our mrf product  the atca based mpx the mpx broadens the available market to include the rapidly growing volte deployments as carriers seek to add voice transmission capabilities to the next generation lte networks 
for  revenues in the software solutions product group increased million to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the july acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed million due to the addition of trillium software products to our revenue profile 
this was offset by the timing of mrf deployments 
com express and rackmount server revenues in the com express and rackmount server products group decreased million to million in from million in revenues decreased due to a strategic decision to de emphasize development and sales of these products 
however  in  management began reinvesting in this product line  and we expect revenue growth to resume in for  revenues in the com express and rackmount server products group increased million to million in from million in this was due to increased sales of our com express products to a customer in the telecommunications industry 
other products revenues in the other products product group decreased million to million in from million in this decrease is the result of these hardware centric products reaching their end of life and our largest customer transitioning to atca based products

revenues from the asia pacific region decreased million to million in from million in softening in the macro telecom spending environment and timing of deployments within the remainder of our customer base was offset by strong deployments by our japanese customers 
revenues from the asia pacific region increased million to million in from million in the increase was the result of increased revenues from our atca product group as a result of increased g and g lte infrastructure deployments 
in addition  revenues in benefited from the acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed million to revenues as compared to we currently expect continued fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
additionally  we expect non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenue profile 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to in from in gross margin was favorably impacted as our higher margin atca and software solutions products comprised of our revenues in as compared to during this increase in gross margin was offset by an increase in cost of sales as the amortization of purchased technology increased to million in from million in and a decrease in gross margin from our other products product group to in from in gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to in from in gross margin was unfavorably impacted in compared to due to the continued deterioration of gross margin for our other products product group and higher amortization of purchased technology  which increased to million in from million in these factors were offset by favorable product mix as higher margin software solutions products comprised a larger share of our revenues in as compared to operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands for the years ended december  change vs vs research and development selling  general and administrative intangible assets amortization impairment of goodwill restructuring and acquisition related charges  net gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary total research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salary  bonuses and benefits for product development staff  and cost of design and development supplies and equipment  net of reimbursements for nonrecurring engineering services 
r d expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase was attributable to higher product development costs associated with the development and introduction of our g t series atca products and continued development of both our trillium small cell and mpx mrf products 
r d headcount increased to at december  from at december  r d expenses increased million to million in from million in these increases were due to the acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed million to r d expense in over the comparable period  an million increase in non recurring engineering charges and a million increase in temporary labor 
these increases were offset by lower payroll and payroll related costs of million in primarily resulting from the transition of r d activities to lower cost geographies in asia 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  bonuses and benefits for sales  marketing  executive and administrative personnel  as well as professional services and costs of other general corporate activities 
sg a expenses decreased million to million in from million in the decrease is the result of restructuring actions that reduced overall headcount and resulted in a decrease in payroll  commissions  and related expenses of million in from and lower incentive compensation of million as a result of the company performance 
the decrease was also affected by a reduction in stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the reversal of expense associated with the radisys corporation long term incentive plan as amended and restated  as further amended  the ltip of million  as discussed further under stock based compensation expense 
sg a headcount decreased to at december  from at december  sg a expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses in was primarily due to the acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed an additional million to sg a expenses  increased commissions of million resulting from strong design win performance in the second half of  and increased third party sales commissions 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million 
stock based compensation expense decreased due to the reversal of ltip expense for named executive officers that forfeited shares upon their departure as a result of not completing the requisite service period 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was offset by increased expense for new grants and assumed options associated with acquisition of continuous computing 
intangible assets amortization intangible assets amortization increased million to million in from million in the increase in amortization is the result of our july acquisition of continuous computing 
during the third quarter of  we determined there were sufficient indicators of potential impairment to require an interim impairment assessment 
this assessment resulted in the full impairment of our goodwill  however  during this assessment it was determined that our long lived intangible assets were not impaired 
in  intangible assets amortization increased million to million in from million in intangible assets amortization increased primarily due to the july acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed million to amortization expense 
the increase associated with continuous computing intangible assets was offset by a decrease of million resulting from final amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of convedia corporation  a closely held vendor of ip media servers 
we perform reviews for impairment of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill we completed an impairment analysis of goodwill pursuant to asc during the second quarter of as we determined that a triggering event occurred during the second quarter that required analysis of both our goodwill and long lived assets for impairment 
we concluded at that time that we passed the first step of the two step impairment test and therefore no impairment of goodwill was recorded 
however  during the third quarter of  we observed additional impairment indicators  including a further deterioration in the market in which we operate and a decrease in our market capitalization 
accordingly  in connection with the preparation of our third quarter financial statements  we completed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing all of our goodwill 
we estimated the fair value of our single reporting unit using a market approach 
the market approach estimates fair value in part on market capitalization plus an estimated control premium paid in acquisitions of publicly traded companies with similar characteristics to radisys 
based upon our analysis  the implied fair value of goodwill was lower than its carrying value 
restructuring and acquisition related charges  net restructuring and acquisition related charges  net include expenses associated with restructuring activities as well as integration  transaction and legal fees  and retention bonuses incurred in connection with our acquisition of continuous computing 
we evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring charges on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we record reversals to the accrued restructuring in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued 
restructuring and acquisition related charges  net decreased million to million in from million in the million decrease in restructuring and acquisition related charges  net is due to activities associated with our acquisition of continuous computing  which were largely completed in the following is the composition of charges during million acquisition related charges associated with overlap of notified employees as we transition our r d activities to lower cost geographies  million severance and benefits provided to restructured employees 
of this charge  million is associated with the contractual severance benefits provided to our former chief executive officer  million lease abandonment for certain north american facilities resulting from facilities rationalization  million restructuring charges related to the continuous computing restructuring plan  and million decrease in fair value of the continuous computing contingent consideration liability due to decreases in projected revenues earned during the applicable measurement period 
restructuring and acquisition related charges  net increased million to million in from million in the increase is due to our acquisition of continuous computing  which resulted in restructuring expense of million and acquisition related charges of million 
gain on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary during  as part of an update to our tax planning strategy  we completed the liquidation of radisys technology ireland limited rtil 
as a result of this liquidation  we recorded a million gain to reflect the realization of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to rtil 
this gain represents the net unrealized foreign currency translation gains accumulated from changes in exchange rates and the related effects from the translation of assets and liabilities of rtil 
stock based compensation expense included within costs of sales  r d and sg a are expenses associated with stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense consists of amortization of stock based compensation associated with unvested stock options  restricted stock units issued to employees under the stock plan  the continuous computing plan  the continuous computing inducement stock plan  ltip  and the employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred and recognized stock based compensation expense as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change vs vs cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative total in  stock based compensation expense decreased from due to a decrease in ltip expense 
in the second quarter of  we determined it was improbable that the ltip performance goal would be attained prior to the end of the measurement period and  as a result  previously recognized ltip expense was reversed during the quarter ended june  the impact of this reversal by functional income statement classification was as follows cost of sales million  r d million  and sg a million 
this compares to expense recognized under the ltip as follows cost of sales million  r d million  and sg a million 
in  stock based compensation expense decreased over due to the reversal of ltip expense for named executive officers of million and was offset by additional expense associated with the acquisition of continuous computing 
non operating expenses the following table summarizes our non operating expenses in thousands for the years ended december  change vs vs interest expense interest income other income expense  net total interest expense interest expense includes interest incurred on our convertible notes and our lines of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs 
in interest expense decreased million to million in from million in due to the repurchases of million and million of our convertible senior notes in december and august in interest expense decreased million to million from million in due to a decrease in the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit 
during  we had no outstanding balances or letters of credit outstanding on our line of credit 
interest income and other income expense  net interest income decreased  to  in from million in as the result of a decrease in our average cash balance resulting from our july acquisition of continuous computing 
interest income decreased million to million in from million in due to a decline in the weighted average balance of interest bearing investments held as a result of cash paid for the acquisition of continuous computing coupled with a decline in the average yield on investments due to a more conservative investment strategy 
in  other income expense  net did not materially change from we experienced an increase in the amortization of forward points expense associated with our indian rupee inr foreign currency hedges which was offset by a decrease in the foreign exchange impact of our entities which do not use the us dollar usd as their functional currency 
in  other income expense  net increased million to million due to the expense of million in as a result of the strengthening of the usd against currencies of our non usd functional currency subsidiaries 
specifically  as a result of our acquisition of continuous computing  we now have exposure to the inr  which  as a result of weakening against the usd  gave rise to a substantial portion of the gain recognized in other income expense in in the fourth quarter of  we began entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the inr to limit our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the inr and usd 
income tax provision we recorded tax expense of million for the year ended december  as compared to a tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and december  our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance provided against our us net deferred tax assets and canadian scientific research and experimental development expenditures claims 
in addition to the aforementioned items  the effective tax rate for differs from the statutory rate due to a partial release of our valuation allowance provided against its us net deferred tax assets as a result of the purchase of continuous computing 
purchase accounting includes the establishment of a deferred tax liability due to the book tax basis differences related to specifically identified non goodwill intangibles resulting from the acquisition 
the net deferred tax liability from the acquisition created an additional source of income to utilize our deferred tax assets which resulted in a reduction of our valuation allowance 
as such  due to this additional source of income an income tax benefit of million was recognized upon the partial valuation allowance release 
at december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
we had valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  which represents a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
based on our review of all positive and negative evidence  including a three year us cumulative pre tax loss and taxable loss  it was concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against our us net deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our foreign net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize all or a portion of the us net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  as of december  will be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign countries  and on occasion  we have been subject to corporate income tax audits 
in determining the amount of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  we have evaluated whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that may result from examination 
to the extent the ultimate outcome of an examination differs from the amounts provided for as uncertain tax positions either additional expense or benefit will be recognized in the period in which the examination is effectively settled 
during the canada revenue agency cra completed an examination of our tax years through we agreed to the proposed adjustments and effectively settled the examination during the effective settlement did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
during an internal revenue service irs examination was effectively settled when we agreed to a notice of proposed adjustment that was issued by the irs 
the proposed adjustment was provided in full as an uncertain tax position at december  we are currently under tax examination in india 
the periods covered under examination are the financial years through the examination is in various stages of appellate proceedings and all material uncertain tax positions associated with the examination have been taken into account in the ending balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at december  we are not under examination by tax authorities in any other jurisdictions

as of december  and  the fair value of our convertible senior notes was million and million 
on february   the maturity date of the convertible senior notes  we repaid the entire outstanding balance of the convertible senior notes in accordance with the terms thereof 
convertible senior notes on june   we entered into subscription agreements with certain holders of the convertible senior notes 
pursuant to the subscription agreements  on june  we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes for million aggregate principal amount of the new convertible senior notes 
the convertible senior notes mature on february  holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes into a number of shares of our common stock determined as set forth in the indenture governing the notes at their option on any day to and including the business day prior to the maturity date 
the convertible senior notes are initially convertible into shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  holders of the convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
in addition  if certain fundamental changes occur  we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for any convertible senior notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
the convertible senior notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to our future subordinated debt 
our obligations under the convertible senior notes are not guaranteed by  and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of its subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to its future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such debt 
as of december  we had outstanding convertible senior notes with a face value of million 
as of december   the fair value of our convertible senior notes was million  which is based on quoted prices of our publicly traded debt on such balance sheet date 
derivatives we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the indian rupee to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the purpose of our hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets  liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in general  our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit related losses in the event of non performance 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings 
all derivatives  including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets and unrealized loss positions are recorded as other current liabilities 
changes in the fair values of the outstanding derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until net income loss is affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction 
typically  hedge ineffectiveness could result when the amount of our hedge contracts exceed our forecasted or actual transactions for which the hedge contracts were designed to hedge 
once a hedge contract matures the associated gain loss on the contract will remain in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income loss  at which time the gain loss will be recorded to the expense line item being hedged  which is primarily cost of sales and r d 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their nature  estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
if anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions change significantly  we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income loss to other income expense during the quarter in which the changes occur 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect of such on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total thereafter operating leases capital leases purchase obligations a contingent consideration b convertible senior notes c convertible senior notes interest on convertible senior notes total a purchase obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
these purchase obligations are entered into in the ordinary course of business and are expected to be funded by cash flows from continuing operations 
b contingent consideration reflects the earn out payments we agreed to pay in connection with the acquisition of continuous computing 
the amounts are based on forecasted revenues at december  and will change based on the actual revenues at each payout date 
see note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the contingent consideration 
c the convertible senior notes were repaid in full on february  in addition to the above  we have approximately million associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any activity involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
shelf registration statement on october   we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on form s for the offering from time to time of up to million in securities consisting of common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective on november   and it will expire in november except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes  which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses  repaying existing debt  providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets 
liquidity outlook at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents  cash expected to be generated from operations and our line of credit facility will satisfy our short and long term expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  stock repurchases  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing business operations 
as a result of our repayment of our convertible senior notes on february   we expect to utilize our line of credit to supplement our cash balances in order to address inter quarter timing of cash collections and payments 
we believe our current working capital  plus availability under the line of credit  provides sufficient liquidity to operate the business at normal levels throughout critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition multiple element arrangements a significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
most product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
the software elements included in certain components of atca systems and mrf products are considered to be functioning together with the non software elements to provide the tangible product essential functionality and these arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware  technical support services as well as software upgrades or enhancements on a when and if available basis 
arrangements that include multiple elements require significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  our performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
asu provides a fair value hierarchy in order to determine the appropriate relative fair value for each element of an arrangement 
when available  we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to determine the estimated selling price 
in the absence of vsoe or third party evidence tpe for a delivered element  we then use an estimated selling price in order to determine fair value 
estimated selling prices represent our best estimate of the price at which it would transact if the deliverables were sold on a standalone basis 
for technical support services  we generally determine our selling price based on vsoe as supported by substantive renewal rates in the related service agreements 
in certain instances where vsoe cannot be established  we then rely upon the estimated selling price for such deliverables as tpe is generally not available due to the unique company specific terms surrounding such service agreements 
in establishing an appropriate estimated selling price for these technical support agreements  we considered entity specific factors such as its historical and projected costs  historical and projected revenues  and profit objectives 
we also considered market specific factors when establishing reasonable profit objectives 
revenues on a product and services basis are as follows in thousands for the years ended december  hardware software licenses and royalties technical support services professional and other services total revenues hardware revenue from hardware products is recognized in accordance with asc revenue recognition 
under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights as well as for price protection rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
the software elements included in certain components of atca systems and mrf products are considered to be functioning together with the non software elements to provide the tangible product essential functionality and our atca arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware  technical support services as well as specified software upgrades or enhancements 
software licenses and royalties revenue from software licenses and royalties is recognized in accordance with asc software 
revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software master provided that the revenue recognition criteria have been met and vsoe exists to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we defer revenue on arrangements including specified software upgrades until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
technical support services technical support services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contract in accordance with applicable gaap for revenue recognition 
the fair value of our post contract support has been determined by renewal rates within our support agreements  the actual amounts charged to customers for renewal of their support services or based on an estimated selling price 
professional and other services professional services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered or as services are performed under the percentage of completion method when we are reasonably able to estimate the total effort required to complete the contract 
deferred income deferred income represents amounts received or billed for the following types of transactions undelivered elements of an arrangement certain arrangements include specified software upgrades and enhancements to an existing product 
revenue for such arrangements is deferred until the future obligation is fulfilled 
technical support services we have a number of technical support agreements with our customers for hardware and software maintenance 
generally  these services are billed in advance and recognized over the term of the agreement 
distributor sales certain sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december  we no longer have material deferred revenues associated with distributor sales as a result of revising the terms of our agreements during allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our largest customer 
if one of our large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us  the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and  there were no significant account balances reserved 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers 
this non specific bad debt reserve is calculated based on our historical pattern of bad debt write offs as a percentage of annual revenues  which percentage is then applied to the current rolling four quarter revenue 
inventory valuation we record an inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our inventory valuation allowances establish a new cost basis for inventory 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  regulatory requirements affecting components  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 
goodwill and long lived assets our long lived assets include definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of our definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million and million 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses  trade names and customer lists 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from six months to ten years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and other physical assets owned by us 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the expected future cash flows and the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with all acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter as well as when certain triggering events suggest impairment has occurred 
as of december  and  the company balance of goodwill was and million 
accrued restructuring because we have a history of paying severance benefits  expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability and timing to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring and acquisition related charges  net in the results of operations section 
accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally or months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by our contract manufacturer is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
accrued warranty reserves are included in short term and long term other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes income tax accounting requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized due to inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant period to utilize the deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
we evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in all of our operational jurisdictions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria that allow financial statement benefits to be recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon tax audit  administrative appeals or final court determination 
the liabilities are reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
changes to our assumptions could cause a revision of past estimates 
such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period 
for ltip and overlay certain performance based restricted stock unit awards under the overlay plan of the stock plan  the overlay awards the requisite service period is equal to the period of time over which performance objectives underlying the award are expected to be achieved 
the number of ltip and overlay shares that vest depends on the achievement of certain performance criteria over the measurement period 
quarterly  we reevaluate the period during which the performance objective will be met and the number of ltip and overlay shares expected to vest 
the amount of expense recorded each period for ltip and overlay awards is based on our estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plans using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates several highly subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and interest rates 
in reaching our determination of expected volatility  we use the historic volatility of our shares of common stock 
we base the expected term of our stock options on historic experience 
the expected term for purchase rights under our employee stock plans is based on the month offering period 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share 
the calculation includes several assumptions that require management judgment 
the expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact the results of operations in the event such changes are made 
in addition  if we were to modify any awards  additional charges would be taken 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
contingent consideration contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date based upon the estimated fair value of the contingent payment for all acquisitions 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with any adjustments in fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset  other than goodwill  is impaired 
entities are required to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
if an entity concludes  based on an evaluation of all relevant qualitative factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  it is not required to perform the quantitative impairment test for that asset 
because the qualitative assessment is optional  an entity is permitted to bypass it for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and apply the quantitative test 
asu also permits the entity to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
asu is effective for impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the canadian dollar  euro  chinese yuan  indian rupee  japanese yen  malaysian ringgit  new shekel and british pound sterling 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
based on our policy  we have established a foreign currency exposure management program which uses derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional currency exposures 
in order to reduce the potentially adverse effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we have entered into forward exchange contracts 
these hedging transactions limit our exposure to changes in the us dollar to the indian rupee exchange rates  and as of december  the total notional or contractual value of the contracts we held was million 
these contracts will mature over the next two years 
holding other variables constant  a adverse fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the indian rupee would require an adjustment of million and increase our indian rupee hedge liability as of december   to million 
a favorable fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the indian rupee would result in an adjustment of million  reversing our indian rupee hedge liability and creating a hedge asset as december   in the amount of million 
we do not expect a fluctuation to have any impact on our operating results as the underlying hedged transactions will move in an equal and opposite direction 
if there is an unfavorable movement in the indian rupee relative to our hedged positions this would be offset by reduced expenses  after conversion to the us dollar  associated with obligations paid for in the indian rupee 
convertible notes 
the fair value of the and convertible senior notes is sensitive to interest rate changes as well as changes in our stock price 
interest rate changes would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible senior notes due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of the obligation 
fluctuations in our stock price would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible senior notes due to the value of the notes derived from the conversion feature 
unless we elect to repurchase our convertible senior notes in the open market  changes in the fair value of the convertible senior notes have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
the estimated combined fair value of the and convertible senior notes was million at december
