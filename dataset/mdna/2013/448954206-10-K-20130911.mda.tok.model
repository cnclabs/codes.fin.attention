item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our corporate mission is to provide energy for the future by exploring for  developing new  and re establishing pre existing sources of energy 
our primary focus is the advancement of exploration work in guinea 
we also plan to continue to evaluate and consider other global oil and gas opportunities 
we have no source of operating revenue  and there is no assurance when we will  if ever 
we have no operating cash flows  and we will require substantial additional funds  through additional participants  securities offerings  or through other means  to fulfill our business plans 
our operating plan within the next months includes the following initiate with tullow and dana a new drilling program in the deep water and commence drilling of an exploration well in the first calendar quarter of continue to evaluate and consider other global oil and gas opportunities 
analysis of changes in financial position our current assets increased by  from  on june  to  on june  the increase in current assets is due to the million in net cash proceeds received on the sale of a interest in the concession to tullow 
this was offset by cash used for general and administrative expenditures as well as capital expenditures 

table of contents our long term assets decreased  from  on june   to  on june  this decrease was primarily due the reduction to our full cost pool upon the receipt of million in net proceeds received on the sale of a interest in the concession to tullow 
this was offset by million in capital expenditures associated with the processing of our most recent  square kilometer d seismic survey 
our current liabilities decreased  from  on june  to  on june  the decrease in current liabilities can be attributed in part to a decrease in accrued employee bonus expense resulting from the timing of bonus payments 
our long term liabilities decreased from  at june   to  at june   due to the amortization of deferred rent during the year 
results of operations based on the factors discussed below  the net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended june   decreased  to a net loss of  or per share in the period from a net loss of  or per share in the period in each case  after giving effect to the for reverse stock split effected july

reportable segments we have one reportable segment our international operations in guinea conducted through our subsidiary scs 
scs is engaged in oil and gas exploration activities pertaining to offshore republic of guinea 
comparison for fiscal year and revenues 
there were no revenues for the years ended june  and depreciation 
depreciation decreased  or  from the fiscal period to the fiscal period 
depreciation expense was  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributed to assets used in the prior period relating to drilling operations being fully depreciated or sold in the current period 
general  administrative and other operating expenses 
our general  administrative and other operating expenses were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of  or  from the fiscal period to the fiscal period 
of this decrease   is attributable to a decrease in non cash stock compensation from  in the to  in the including  in non cash expense associated with an award of common shares associated with a severance agreement in the current year 
the remaining  decrease in expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated with prospective oil and gas investment opportunities of approximately  additionally  there was a decrease in travel expenses of approximately  primarily as a result of the closure of our offices in guinea and london 
this was offset by an increase in employee related costs of  which is the result of a  increase in severance costs associated with staff reductions offset by a  decrease in recurring payroll expense as a result of the staff reductions 
additionally  there were increases in legal and accounting fees of approximately  and a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains from current operations in the current period of approximately  our foreign currency transaction gains are the result of a large balance in 
table of contents accounts payable denominated in foreign currency  primarily associated with our drilling contract with agr  for which payment has been frozen pending the resolution of our legal dispute with agr 
amortization and write off of costs 
we fully amortized our proved oil and gas properties of  and wrote off a prospective investment deposit of  during the year ended june  we amortized an additional  of proved oil and gas properties during the year ended june  these are additional costs recognized during the year ended june  associated with the non commercial sabu well 
as required by the full cost accounting rules  we evaluated and moved these costs to proved properties and then fully amortized them through our full cost ceiling test 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in other income is primarily the result of the reversal to net income of other than temporary impairment of available for sale securities of  during fiscal while there was no such reversal in the current period 
this was offset by a decrease in interest income from to loss from continuing operations 
primarily as a result of the full amortization of proved oil and gas properties and the write off of the prospective investment deposit discussed above  which together total  in fiscal  and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  our loss from continuing operations decreased by  from  in the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  comparison for fiscal year and revenues

amortization and write off of costs 
we fully amortized our proved oil and gas properties of  as a result of the non commercial sabu well drilling outcome  as required by full cost accounting rules  we evaluated and moved to proved properties  of costs which were then fully amortized though our full cost ceiling test 
additionally we have written off a prospective investment deposit of  other income expense 
other income expense totaled  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily the result of a loss on the warrant derivative liability in the prior fiscal period 
in the fiscal period  we recognized a non cash loss on the warrant derivative liability of  no such gain or loss was incurred on the warrant derivative liability in fiscal as the remaining warrants underlying the derivative were exercised 
table of contents during the second quarter of fiscal however  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of available for sale securities of  during fiscal loss from continuing operations 
primarily as a result of the full amortization of proved oil and gas properties and the write off of the prospective investment deposit discussed above  which together total  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  our loss from continuing operations increased by  from  in the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources capital resource considerations on december   our wholly owned subsidiary  scs  closed a sale to tullow guinea ltd tullow  a subsidiary of tullow oil plc  of a gross interest in the concession 
as consideration  scs received million from tullow as reimbursement of past costs of scs in the concession  and as additional consideration  tullow agreed to i pay scs participating interest share of future costs associated with the drilling of an exploration well in at least  meters of water in the deep water fan area of the concession  up to a gross expenditure cap of million  and ii pay scs share of costs associated with an appraisal well of the initial exploration well  if drilled  subject to a gross expenditure cap on the appraisal well of million 
tullow is obligated to pay its participating interest share of costs associated with the concession as of november   the date of execution of the purchase and sale agreement 
tullow will begin to pay scs costs attributable to the concession at the earlier of i the commencement of the next exploration period  september   or ii should a decision be made to begin spending on an exploration well prior to committing to the next exploration period  the date of such spending 
tullow will continue to pay scs costs  subject to the gross expenditure cap of million  until days following the date on which the rig contracted to drill the exploration well moves off the well location 
as part of our agreement  tullow will use reasonable endeavors to provide for the commencement of drilling of the exploration well not later than april  the december sale to tullow improved our cash position and liquidity  and we have adequate funds to conduct our current operations 
however  our ability to drill additional wells may depend on obtaining additional resources through sales of additional interests in the concession  equity or debt financings  or through other means 
if we farm out additional interests in the concession  our percentage will decrease 
although we have been successful in raising capital and in entering into key participation arrangements with dana and tullow  we have no firm commitments for additional capital resources 
the terms of any such arrangements  if made  are unknown  and may not be advantageous 
liquidity on june   we had million in cash  million in available for sale securities and million in restricted cash  which is held in escrow in connection with our drilling contract with agr 
we had million in liabilities  which are comprised of current liabilities of million  which includes million of liabilities currently pending resolution of our dispute with agr  and noncurrent liabilities of million 
we plan to use our existing cash to fund our general corporate needs and our expenditures associated with the concession  including our share of future capital expenditures that are not paid by tullow on our behalf 
we have no other material commitments 
we have filed suit against agr following unsuccessful negotiations to address the cost overruns associated with the sabu well 
payment of the remaining drilling costs is pending resolution of this dispute 
agr filed a countersuit on october  in which agr has made claims for additional cost of million on a gross basis or million based on the interest we then held  which we dispute and have excluded from cost incurred to date 
additionally  agr holds million on a gross 
table of contents basis of excess materials acquired during the drilling of the sabu well 
we dispute agr entitlement to these assets 
resolution of this dispute may result in the recovery of a portion of the costs incurred to date  however  it is possible that the resolution of this dispute may result in additional liability associated with disputed costs 
we have satisfied all requirements of the current exploration period  which runs until september under the concession 
the consortium sent notice to the government of guinea of our intention to renew the second exploration period to september and the coordinates of the area to be relinquished as required under the psc 
the second exploration period may be extended for one additional year beyond to allow the completion of a well in process and for two additional years to allow the completion of the appraisal of any discovery made 
additionally  to satisfy the september work requirement  an additional exploration well is required to be drilled  which is to be commenced by the end of september  to a minimum depth of  meters below seabed 
we plan to commence the drilling of a deepwater exploration well during the first quarter of calendar  which would satisfy the requirement to drill in the second exploration period 
tullow has agreed to pay scs participating interest share of future costs associated with the drilling of this well  up to a gross expenditure cap of million 
additionally  tullow has agreed to pay scs participating interest share of future costs associated with the drilling of an appraisal of the initial exploration well  if drilled  up to a gross expenditure cap of million 
we are responsible for our share of any costs exceeding the gross expenditure cap of million on either well 
we have made adjustments to our overhead costs in connection with the transfer of operatorship to tullow on april  overhead adjustments during the year ended june  included houston office staff reductions and the closure of our offices in london and guinea 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings 
we are unable to predict the outcome of such matters  however  an adverse development could have an impact on liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to changes in working capital during the period 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  was  compared to cash used in investing activities of  in the year ended june  this decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures from  during which we drilled a well  to additionally  in the current period we received million in net proceeds from the sale of an interest in our oil and gas properties 
this was offset by the purchase of million in available for sale securities in the current year compared to the prior period in which proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities were approximately million 
there was net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  of  compared to  during the year ended june  we received approximately  in proceeds from the issuance of stock during fiscal  whereas no cash was received for the issuance of stock in the current year 
contractual commitments and obligations our subsidiary  scs  has  remaining of a contingent note payable due to the former owners of scs corporation assets 
it is payable in our common stock and it is payable only if scs has net income in any given quarter 
if scs experiences net income in a quarter  of the income will be paid against the note  until the contingency is satisfied 

table of contents disclosure of contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years installment obligations operating lease obligations total we are subject to certain commitments under the psc as discussed in item above 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those estimates that may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates 
we base our estimates and judgment on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
oil and gas properties we account for oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of proved oil and natural gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and annual lease rentals are capitalized 
all selling  general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  or to the extent that the sale proceeds exceed our capitalized costs 
depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  net of tax considerations 
in accordance with sec release  prices based on the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements  are used in deriving future net revenues discounted at  net of tax 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs excluded costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs incurred should be transferred to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 

table of contents we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
we assess our unevaluated properties on a country by country basis 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
however  if proved reserves have not yet been established in a full cost pool  these costs are charged against earnings 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
at june    we had million of capitalized costs associated with our guinea operations  which is net of million in amortization as a result of reclassifying costs incurred on previously unevaluated properties to proved properties 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes and binomial lattice valuation models using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
share based compensation we follow asc which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
asc also requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we account for non employee share based awards based upon the provisions of asc  equity based payments to non employees 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we had  prior to their closures  some foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our in country offices in guinea and the united kingdom and from certain costs in our drilling program 
us dollars are accepted in guinea and many of our purchases and purchase obligations  such as our office lease in guinea  were denominated in us dollars 
however  our costs for labor  supplies  and fuel could have increased if the guinea franc  the euro  or the pound sterling significantly appreciated against the us dollar 
we did not hedge the exposure to currency rate changes 
we do not believe our exposure to market risk to be material
