market conditions real estate activity showed some encouraging signs as the nationwide average of home prices have appeared to hit a bottom and are starting to recover  although home prices continued to decline in many parts of the us during as evidenced below by the standard poor case shiller city composite home price index for december home prices have stayed within a tight range over the last three years 
however  the trajectory of the index has turned sharply positive and increased since reaching its low in early home sales continue on an upward trend with purchase applications showing small but steady year over year growth 
some positive news indicates that december housing starts reached the highest level in four years with both single family and multi family starts finishing with significant increases 
single family starts saw a increase in while multi family housing starts increased for the year  according to the mortgage bankers association 
the trend is expected to continue into as housing permits continued on an upward trajectory 
as housing continues to recover  increased competition will continue to effect margins and market share for mortgage loan originators 
while the average rate of a year fixed rate mortgage tracked by freddie mac has risen from a record low in november  that less than half of the increase in a bloomberg index of yields on the government backed securities into which lenders package new loans 
this difference  known as the primary secondary spread  is a gauge of the profitability of originators 
while the secondary spread reached an all time high of in september  it is expected that the margin will begin to normalize in as new competitors enter the market and refinance activity begins to decline 
as a result of the current conditions of the us economy  short term interest rates have been and are expected to remain relatively low 
in the december federal open market committee statement  the committee decided to replace their calendar approach  whereby rates were scheduled to stay low until mid  with numerical thresholds to keep rates at low levels as long as the unemployment rate remains above and inflation is at or less 
the committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in september 
the committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction 
the combination of these actions may increase equity prices and has decreased mortgage interest rates 
although the benefits of these actions are difficult to assess  the expectation is that they will add to the current moderate pace of consumer spending and to the improving pace of new and existing home purchases in

discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for due to million in legal settlements reached for two remaining legacy lawsuits  significant legal fees incurred during defending these matters and a million increase in the repurchase reserve provision related to the discontinued mortgage operations conducted by ifc 
status of operations today  we primarily have three operating segments mortgage lending  real estate services and long term mortgage portfolio also collectively referred to as our continuing operations 
mortgage lending our mortgage lending business grew rapidly during and in  all sources of origination volume more than doubled from however  our correspondent channel achieved the most significant growth as a percentage of total originations 
to facilitate the growth  we expanded our warehouse borrowing capacity 
additionally we were able to grow our servicing portfolio 
for the year ended december  in millions change originations servicing portfolio warehouse capacity includes approximately million in unpaid principal balance of servicing sold but not transferred as of december  our strategy is to expand our mortgage lending platform and generate attractive  risk adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term by maintaining our ability to sell mortgage loans directly to gses and issue government securities through ginnie mae  diversifying and increasing origination volumes of mortgage loans across all of our channels retail  wholesale and correspondent  increasing the proportion of purchase money transactions as compared to re financing transactions in our mix of loan volume to help create more stable origination volumes  expanding our product offering to include more products that are less sensitive to changing interest rates and retain the mortgage servicing rights to those products  increasing the brand awareness of our impac brand through marketing and public relations campaigns  increasing our mortgage servicing portfolio with additional high credit quality and low coupon conventional and government loans  and increasing our operational efficiencies 

table of contents our loan products primarily include conventional loans for fannie mae and freddie mac and government loans insured by fha  va and usda 
originations by loan type for the year ended december  in millions change government conventional other total originations weighted average fico weighted average ltv weighted average coupon average loan size includes government insured loans including fha  va and usda includes loans eligible for sale to fannie mae and freddie mac fico fair isaac company credit score ltv loan to value measures ratio of loan balance to estimated property value based upon third party appraisal we expect to continue originating conventional and government insured loans as we believe that having the ability to sell loans direct to gses and issue ginnie mae securities makes us more competitive with regard to products  pricing  operational efficiencies and overall recruitment of high quality loan originators 
in  our mortgage lending channels that experienced the largest percentage of growth were our retail and correspondent channels 
for the year ended december  in millions originations by channel wholesale retail correspondent total originations we believe that having a more balanced origination mix across our channels will translate into improved gain on sale pricing from retail loans  increased efficiency in the correspondent channel and better position the company for future opportunities 
we expect to continue our expansion and growth in originations through our retail and correspondent channels 
we believe that this will primarily be achieved by opening new retail offices and hiring additional retail loan officers for our existing offices and call centers and increasing our active customer base in correspondent channel 
we believe our wholesale lending channel will continue to be a key component of our origination platform  however our focus to expand our retail and correspondent origination volumes will more equally balance originations across all of our channels 

table of contents improving the mix of purchase money transactions creates better opportunities to increase our origination market share in a decreasing refinance market 
for the year ended december  in millions originations by purpose refinance purchase total originations to better capture purchase money business  we invested in and designed a web based technology that both loan officers and real estate brokers can use to create leads and provide financing to borrowers 
through this technology  we have been able to increase the number of relationships with real estate professionals  leading to an increase in purchase money transactions 
as of the end of  we had in excess of  real estate professionals using the technology with over  real estate listings 
we have also enhanced our product offering to include more loan products less sensitive to changing interest rates  including fha k  a home improvement loan that provides the borrower funds to make renovations  reverse mortgages  intermediate adjustable rate mortgages and gse and government sponsored loan programs such as home affordable refinance program harp loans which help timely paying borrowers to refinance into a loan with a lower interest rate despite the loan balance being greater than the estimated fair value of their home 
we believe that these loan products will prepay at a slower rate as compared to other products 
by retaining these loan products in our servicing portfolio  we expect to maintain a less volatile mortgage servicing portfolio 
during  our warehouse borrowing capacity increased million to million 
at december   we had five warehouse lender relationships  including one relationship with a major national financial institution 
during the first quarter of  we obtained approvals for an additional million in total warehouse capacity including a new relationship with another national warehouse lending bank 
during  the mortgage servicing portfolio increased to billion as compared to million at the end of we earn servicing fees  net of sub servicer costs from our mortgage servicing portfolio 
the servicing portfolio generated gross servicing fees of million  and thousand in and  respectively

loan size in thousands represents mortgage loans funded and setup on our sub servicer system  but not sold yet represents servicing portfolio acquired in acquisition of amerihome during  the mortgage servicing portfolio increased to billion from million at the end of  generating gross servicing fees of million  and thousand in and  respectively 
we also believe that there are other opportunities that exist in today mortgage and lending markets 
depending on the amount of capital we have available  either internally generated or otherwise  we are considering pursuing opportunities to begin originating small balance multifamily loans  originating  pooling and securitizing jumbo mortgage loans and offering warehouse lines to small banks  credit unions and mortgage banking firms as impac had done in the past 
real estate services we provide portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services including reo surveillance and disposition services  default surveillance and loss recovery services  short sale and real estate brokerage services  portfolio monitoring and reporting services 
for the year ended december  and  real estate services fees  net were million as compared to million in the decrease in real estate services fees  net is primarily due to a decline in the long term mortgage portfolio and the associated real estate and recovery activities as well as the sale of the title insurance company in as expected  the real estate service activities and revenues declined as lending activities and revenues increased from the recent expansion of the mortgage lending business 
we intend to continue to provide these services predominantly for our long term mortgage portfolio 
however  we expect these revenues to gradually decline over time as our long term mortgage 
table of contents portfolio declines 
to the extent that opportunities arise  we may expand our loss mitigation and real estate services to third parties 
long term mortgage portfolio although we have seen some stabilization and improvement in defaults  the portfolio continues to suffer losses and may continue for the foreseeable future until we see a significant decline in the number of foreclosure properties in the market 
at december   our residual interest in securitizations represented by the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities decreased to million  compared to million at december  the decrease in residual fair value in was primarily due to million in cash received and a decrease in fair value related to write downs of reo and changes in assumptions associated with defaults and severities  offset by an increase in fair value related to net interest income accretion 
for additional information regarding the long term mortgage portfolio refer to financial condition and results of operations below 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
our critical accounting policies require management to make difficult and complex judgments that rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the effect of changing market conditions and or consumer behavior 
in determining which accounting policies meet this definition  we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations 
we believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following fair value of financial instruments  variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets and liabilities  net realizable value of reo  repurchase reserve  and interest income and interest expense 
fair value of financial instruments financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
fair value measurements are categorized into a three level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value 
level  which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level is based on observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level  which is the lowest priority in the fair value 
table of contents hierarchy  is based on unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value 
financial instruments classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value  and the use of different assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
mortgage loans held for sale we elected to carry our mortgage loans held for sale originated or acquired from the mortgage lending operation at fair value 
fair value is based on quoted market prices  where available  prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics  and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants 
mortgage servicing rights we elected to carry all of our mortgage servicing rights arising from the mortgage loan origination operation at fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based upon market prices for similar instruments and a discounted cash flow model 
the valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating the fair value of servicing 
these assumptions include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  prepayment and late fees  among other considerations 
derivative financial instruments we utilize certain derivative instruments in the ordinary course of our business to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
these derivative instruments include forward sales of mbs and forward loan sale commitments hedging instruments 
we also issue irlcs to borrowers in connection with single family mortgage loan originations 
we recognize all derivative instruments at fair value 
the estimated fair value of irlcs are based on underlying loan types with similar characteristics using the tba mbs market  which is actively quoted and easily validated through external sources 
the data inputs used in this valuation include  but are not limited to  loan type  underlying loan amount  note rate  loan program  and expected sale date of the loan  adjusted for current market conditions 
these valuations are adjusted at the loan level to consider the servicing release premium and loan pricing adjustments specific to each loan 
for all irlcs  the base value is then adjusted for the anticipated pull through rate 
the fair value of the hedging instruments is based on the actively quoted tba mbs market using observable inputs related to characteristics of the underlying mbs stratified by product  coupon and settlement date and are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the initial and subsequent changes in value of irlcs and forward sale commitments are a component of mortgage lending gains and fees  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
long term debt long term debt consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes is reported at fair value within the long term mortgage portfolio 
these securities are measured based upon an analysis prepared by management  which considers the company own credit risk  including settlements with trust preferred debt holders and discounted cash flow analysis 
unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings in the accompanying statement of operations within non interest income 
our estimate of the fair value of the long term debt requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of the future obligation 
changes in assumptions resulting from changes in the company own credit risk profile will impact the estimated fair value of the long term debt and those changes are recorded as a component of net earnings 
a change in assumptions associated with the improvement in the company own credit risk profile could result in a 
table of contents significant increase in the estimated fair value of the long term debt which would result in a significant charge to net earnings 
variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets and liabilities historically  we securitized mortgages in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations cmo  which were consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes 
we also securitized mortgages in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  which were either consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the design of the securitization structure 
cmo and certain remic securitizations contained structural terms that resulted in the transferee securitization trust to not be a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  and therefore we consolidated the variable interest entity vie as it was the primary beneficiary of the sole residual interest in each securitization trust 
generally  this was achieved by including terms in the securitization agreements that gave us the ability to unilaterally cause the securitization trust to return specific mortgages  other than through a clean up call 
amounts consolidated are included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  derivative assets  securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our estimate of the fair value of our net retained residual interests in unconsolidated securitizations  which are included in investment securities available for sale in the consolidated balance sheets  requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of future cash flows from the residual interests 
we are exposed to credit risk from the underlying mortgage loans in unconsolidated securitizations to the extent we retain subordinated interests 
changes in expected cash flows resulting from changes in expected net credit losses will impact the value of our subordinated retained interests and those changes are recorded as a component of change in fair value of net trust assets 
in contrast  for securitizations that are structured as secured borrowing  we recognize interest income over the life of the securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense incurred for the securitized mortgage borrowings 
we refer to these transactions as consolidated securitizations 
the mortgage loans collateralizing the debt securities for these financings are included in securitized mortgage collateral and the debt securities payable to investors in these securitizations are included in securitized mortgage borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet 
whether a securitization is consolidated or unconsolidated  investors in the securities issued by the securitization trust have no recourse to our non securitized assets or to us and have no ability to require us to provide additional assets  but rather have recourse only to the assets transferred to the trust 
whereas the accounting differences are significant  the underlying economic impact to us  over time  will be the same regardless of whether the securitization trust is consolidated or unconsolidated 
these securitizations are evaluated for consolidation based on the provisions of fasb asc  which eliminated the concept of a qspe and changed the approach to determine a securitization trust primary beneficiary 
amounts consolidated are included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  derivative assets  securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
net realizable value nrv of reo the company considers the nrv of its reo properties in evaluating reo losses 
when real estate is acquired in settlement of mortgage loans  or other real estate owned  the mortgage is written down to a percentage of the property appraised value  broker price opinion or list price less estimated selling costs and including mortgage insurance proceeds expected to be received 
subsequent changes in the nrv of the reo is reflected as a write down of reo and results in additional losses 

table of contents repurchase reserve when we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser 
our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
investors may request us to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase 
upon completion of its own investigation regarding the investor claims  we repurchase or provide indemnification on certain loans  as appropriate 
we maintain a liability reserve for expected losses on dispositions of loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of this repurchase liability reserve based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests  actual loss experience  settlement negotiations  and other relevant factors including economic conditions 
we record a provision for losses relating to such representations and warranties as part of each loan sale transactions 
the method used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a combination of factors  including  but not limited to  estimated future defaults and loan repurchase rates and the potential severity of loss in the event of defaults and the probability of reimbursement by the correspondent loan seller 
we establish a liability at the time loans are sold and continually update our estimated repurchase liability 
the level of the repurchase liability for representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment 
the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors  investor demand strategies  and other external conditions that may change over the lives of the underlying loans 
interest income and interest expense interest income on securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense on securitized mortgage borrowings are recorded using the effective yield for the period based on the previous quarter end estimated fair value 
interest expense on long term debt is recorded using the effective yield method based on estimated future interest rates and cash flows

offsetting the sources of cash were continuing 
table of contents operating expenses totaling million  payments on the notes payable of million including million which came from reserve accounts and settlements of repurchase requests associated with loans sold by the discontinued non conforming mortgage operations of approximately million 
since the consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to the company  trust assets and liabilities have been netted to present our interest in these trusts more simply  which are considered the residual interests in securitizations 
for unconsolidated securitizations the residual interests represent the fair value of investment securities available for sale 
for consolidated securitizations  the residual interests are represented by the fair value of securitized mortgage collateral and real estate owned  offset by the fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and net derivative liabilities 
we receive cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations to the extent they are available after required distributions to bondholders and maintaining specified overcollateralization levels and other specified parameters such as maximum delinquency and cumulative default within the trusts 
the estimated fair value of the residual interests  represented by the difference in the fair value of total trust assets and total trust liabilities  was million at december   compared to million at december  during  we decreased the investor yield requirements for securitized mortgage borrowings as estimated bond prices have continued to improve and corresponding yields have decreased 
the decrease in investor yield assumptions on securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of these trust assets and liabilities 
mortgage loans held for sale increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is due to the expansion of our mortgage lending operations in associated with the growth of our retail and correspondent lending channels 
average monthly loan originations increased to approximately million in as compared to million in mortgage servicing rights increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is due to an increase in our mortgage servicing portfolio with servicing retained loan sales of billion in as compared to million in partially offsetting the increase was the sale of servicing rights of million during and fair value adjustments of million 
at december   we serviced billion in unpaid principal balance upb for others  including million sold but not yet transferred at december  as compared to million at december  at december   the balance of deferred charge was million and was included in other assets 
for the year ended december   we were not required to record income tax expense resulting from deferred charge impairment write downs based on changes in estimated fair value of securitized mortgage collateral 
the deferred charge arose as a result of the deferral of income tax expense on inter company profits that resulted from the sale of mortgages from taxable subsidiaries to imh in prior years when imh was a reit 
this balance is recorded as required by gaap and does not have any realizable cash value 
warehouse borrowings increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is due to the expansion of our mortgage lending operations and increased loan originations 
during  we increased our total borrowing capacity to million at december  as compared to million at december  at december   notes payable was million as compared to million at december  during  we entered into a new million structured debt agreement using eight of our residual interests net trust assets as collateral 
we used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the thousand balance net of the reserve account on the previous debt agreement 
we received

the note payable bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  is amortized in equal principal payments over months and matures in july repurchase reserve liability increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the discontinued lending operations of ifc 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million to settle previous repurchase claims related to our discontinued operations 
our discontinued operations continue to receive repurchase requests from fannie mae resulting in increases in estimated repurchase obligations 
at december   the repurchase reserve within discontinued operations was million as compared to million at december  additionally  we have approximately million in repurchase reserves related to the loans sold by the continuing mortgage lending operations since early other liabilities increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is primarily due to a million legal settlement recorded in the third quarter of  associated with the settlement of two of our remaining legacy lawsuits related to discontinued operations 
book value per common share was as of december   as compared to as of december  inclusive of the remaining million of liquidation preference on our preferred stock 
total assets and total liabilities were billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the changes in total assets and liabilities are primarily attributable to increases in our trust assets and trust liabilities as summarized below 
december  increase decrease change securitized mortgage collateral other trust assets total trust assets securitized mortgage borrowings other trust liabilities total trust liabilities residual interests in securitizations we update our collateral assumptions quarterly based on recent delinquency  default  prepayment and loss experience 
additionally  we update the forward interest rates and investor yield discount rate assumptions based on information derived from market participants 
during  we decreased the investor yield requirements for securitized mortgage borrowings as estimated bond prices have continued to improve and corresponding yields have decreased 
the decrease in investor yield assumptions on securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings resulted in an increase in the value of these trust assets and liabilities 
securitized mortgage collateral increased million during  primarily due to an increase in fair value due to a reduction in investor yield requirements  partially offset by an increase in loss assumptions  reductions in principal from borrower payments and transfers of loans to reo for single family and multi family collateral 
additionally  other trust assets 
table of contents declined million during  primarily due to reo liquidations of million and additional impairment write downs of million 
partially offsetting the decrease from liquidations were increases in reo from foreclosures of million 
securitized mortgage borrowings increased million during  primarily due to an increase in fair value due to a reduction in investor yield requirements  partially offset by an increase in loss assumptions and reductions in principal balances from principal payments during the period for single family and multi family collateral 
the million dollar reduction in other trust liabilities during was primarily due to million in derivative cash payments from the securitization trusts  partially offset by a million increase in derivative fair value resulting from changes in forward libor interest rates 
in previous years  we securitized mortgage loans by transferring originated residential single family mortgage loans and multifamily commercial loans the transferred assets into non recourse bankruptcy remote trusts which in turn issued tranches of bonds to investors supported only by the cash flows of the transferred assets 
because the assets and liabilities in the securitizations are nonrecourse to us  the bondholders cannot look to us for repayment of their bonds in the event of a shortfall 
these securitizations were structured to include interest rate derivatives 
we retained the residual interest in each trust  and in most cases would perform the master servicing 
a trustee and servicer  unrelated to us  was named for each securitization 
cash flows from the loans the loan payments and liquidation of foreclosed real estate properties collected by the loan sub servicer are remitted to us  the master servicer 
the master servicer remits payments to the trustee who remits payments to the bondholders investors 
the sub servicer collects loan payments and performs loss mitigation activities for defaulted loans 
these activities include foreclosing on properties securing defaulted loans  which results in reo 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to consolidate all but one of these trusts as we are not the master servicer on this one trust on our statement of financial condition and results of operations 
for the one trust we did not consolidate  the residual interest is reported as investment securities available for sale 
for the trusts we did consolidate  the loans are included in the statement of financial condition as securitized mortgage collateral  the foreclosed loans are included in the statement of financial condition as real estate owned and the various bond tranches owned by investors are included in the statement of financial condition as securitized mortgage borrowings 
any interest rate derivatives remaining in the trusts are included in our statement of financial condition as derivative assets or derivative liabilities  respectively 
to the extent there is excess overcollateralization as defined in the securitization agreements in these securitization trusts  we receive cash flows from the excess interest collected monthly from the residual interest we own 
because i we elected the fair value option on the securitized mortgage collateral  securitized mortgage borrowings  ii derivative assets liabilities are carried at fair value as required by gaap  and iii real estate owned is reflected at net realizable value nrv  which closely approximates fair market value  the net of the trust assets and trust liabilities represents the estimated fair value of the residual interests we own 
to estimate fair value of the assets and liabilities within the securitization trusts each reporting period  management uses an industry standard valuation and analytical model that is updated monthly with current collateral  real estate  derivative  bond and cost servicer  trustee  etc 
information for each securitization trust 
we employ an internal process to validate the accuracy of the model as well as the data within this model 
forecasted assumptions sometimes referred to as curves  for defaults  loss severity  interest rates libor and prepayments are input into the valuation model for each securitization trust 
we hire third party experts to provide forecasted curves for the aforementioned assumptions for each of the securitizations 
before inputting this information into the model  management employs a process to qualitatively and quantitatively review the assumption curves for reasonableness using other information gathered from the mortgage and real estate market ie  third party home price indices  published industry reports discussing regional mortgage and commercial loan 
table of contents performance and delinquency as well as actual default and foreclosure information for each trust from the respective trustees 
we use the valuation model to generate the expected cash flows to be collected from the trust assets and the expected required bondholder distribution trust liabilities 
to the extent that the trusts are over collateralized  we may receive the excess interest as the holder of the residual interest 
the information above provides us with the future expected cash flows for the securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  securitized mortgage borrowings  derivative assets liabilities  and the residual interests 
to determine the discount rates to apply to these cash flows  we gather information from the bond pricing services and other market participants regarding estimated investor required yields for each bond tranche 
based on that information and the collateral type and vintage  we determine an acceptable range of expected yields an investor would require including an appropriate risk premium for each bond tranche 
we use the blended yield of the bond tranches together with the residual interests to determine an appropriate yield for the securitized mortgage collateral in each securitization after taking into consideration any derivatives in the securitization 
during  based on the trend of improving bond prices and declining yields  we adjusted the acceptable range of expected yields for some of our earlier vintage securitizations

the decrease was primarily due to the combination of both cash received from residual interests net trust assets and an increase in the fair value of total trust assets due to a decrease in investor yield requirements associated with improved market conditions and bond prices 
during  based on the trend of improving bond prices and declining yields  we adjusted the acceptable range of expected yields for some of its earlier vintage securitizations resulting in an increase in fair value of total trust assets and trust liabilities 
the decline in the percentage of net trust assets to total trust assets is due to residual cash flows received which reduces the value of net trust assets and an increase in fair value of securitized mortgage collateral 
since the consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to us  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 
therefore  in the following table we have netted trust assets and trust liabilities to present these residual interests more simply 
our residual interests in securitizations are segregated between our single family sf residential and multifamily mf residential portfolios and are represented by the difference between trust assets and trust liabilities 
the following tables present the estimated fair value of our residual interests  including investment securities available for sale  by securitization vintage year and other related assumptions used to derive these values at december  and estimated fair value of residual interests by vintage year at december  estimated fair value of residual interests by vintage year at december  origination year sf mf total sf mf total total weighted avg

these assumptions include estimated collateral default rates and loss 
table of contents severities credit losses  collateral prepayment rates  forward interest rates and investor yields discount rates 
we use the same collateral assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings as the collateral assumptions determine collateral cash flows which are used to pay interest and principal for securitized mortgage borrowings and excess spread  if any  to the residual interests 
however  we use different investor yield discount rate assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings and the discount rate used for residual interests based on underlying collateral characteristics  vintage year  assumed risk and market participant assumptions

as illustrated in s ps case shiller city composite home price index  from through  home price appreciation escalated to historic levels 
during through  we originated or acquired mortgages supported by these elevated real estate values 
beginning in  deterioration in the economy resulting in high unemployment and a dramatic drop in home prices resulted in significant negative equity for borrowers 
these factors have led to significant increases in loss severities resulting from deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers  as well as strategic defaults  whereby borrowers with the ability to pay are defaulting on their mortgages based on the belief that home prices will not recover in a reasonable amount of time 
home prices have deteriorated back to december levels which has significantly reduced or eliminated equity for loans originated after future loss estimates are significantly higher for mortgage loans included in securitization vintages after which reflect severe home price deterioration and defaults experienced with mortgages originated during these periods 
operational and market risks we are exposed to a variety of market risks which include interest rate risk  credit risk  real estate risk  prepayment risk and liquidity risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk mortgage lending 
we are exposed to interest rate risks relating to our ongoing mortgage lending operations 
we use derivative instruments to manage some of our interest rate risk 
however  we do not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely 
we enter into interest rate lock commitments and commitments to sell mortgages to help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on mortgage lending cash flows 

table of contents interest rate lock commitments expose us to interest rate risk 
the mortgage lending operations currently utilizes forward sold fannie mae and ginnie mae mortgage backed securities to hedge the fair value changes associated with changes in interest rates relating to its mortgage loan origination operations 
interest rate risk securitized trusts  long term debt 
our earnings from the long term mortgage portfolio depend largely on our interest rate spread  represented by the relationship between the yield on our interest earning assets primarily investment securities available for sale and securitized mortgage collateral and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities primarily securitized mortgage borrowings and long term debt 
our interest rate spread is impacted by several factors  including general economic factors  forward interest rates and the credit quality of mortgage loans in the long term mortgage portfolio 
the residual interests in our long term mortgage portfolio are sensitive to changes in interest rates on securitized mortgage collateral and the related securitized mortgage borrowings 
changes in interest rates can significantly affect the cash flows and fair values of the company assets and liabilities  as well as our earnings and stockholders equity 
we use derivative instruments to manage some of our interest rate risk in our long term mortgage portfolio 
however  we do not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely 
to help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on cash flows on securitized mortgage borrowings  we utilize derivative instruments primarily in the form of interest rate swap agreements swaps and  to a lesser extent  interest rate cap agreements caps and interest rate floor agreements floors 
these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
for non exchange traded contracts  fair value is based on the amounts that would be required to settle the positions with the related counterparties as of the valuation date 
valuations of derivative assets and liabilities are based on observable market inputs  if available 
to the extent observable market inputs are not available  fair values measurements include our judgment about future cash flows  forward interest rates and certain other factors  including counterparty risk 
additionally  these values also take into account our own credit standing  to the extent applicable  thus  the valuation of the derivative instrument includes the estimated value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract 
at december   derivative liabilities  net were million and reflect the securitization trust liability to pay third party counterparties based on the estimated value to settle the derivative instruments 
cash payments on these derivative instruments are based on notional amounts that are decreasing over time 
excluding the effects of other factors such as portfolio delinquency and loss severities within the securitization trusts  as the notional amount of these derivative instruments decrease over time  payments to counterparties in the current interest rate environment are reduced  thereby potentially increasing cash flows on our residual interests in securitizations 
conversely  increases in interest rates from current levels could potentially reduce overall cash flows on our residual interests in securitizations 
since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to us  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 
we are also subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes 
these interest bearing liabilities include adjustable rate periods based on three month libor trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to the effect of changing interest rates related to these interest bearing liabilities 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents credit risk we provide representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of the loans sold that typically are in place for the life of the loan 
in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties  we may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser  and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by us unless we have recourse to our correspondent seller 
we maintain a reserve for losses on loans repurchased or indemnified as a result of breaches of representations and warranties on our sold loans 
our estimate is based on our most recent data regarding loan repurchases and indemnity payments  actual losses on repurchased loans  recovery history  among other factors 
our assumptions are affected by factors both internal and external in nature 
internal factors include  among other things  level of loan sales  the expectation of credit loss on repurchases and indemnifications  our success rate at appealing repurchase demands and our ability to recover any losses from third parties 
external factors that may affect our estimate includes  among other things  the overall economic condition in the housing market  the economic condition of borrowers  the political environment at investor agencies and the overall us and world economy 
many of the factors are beyond our control and may lead to judgments that are susceptible to change 
counterparty credit risk 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to various agreements 
we monitor the credit ratings of our counterparties and currently do not anticipate losses due to counterparty non performance 
credit risk securitized trusts 
we manage credit risk by actively managing delinquencies and defaults through our servicers 
starting with the second half of we have not retained any additional alt a mortgages in our long term mortgage portfolio 
our securitized mortgage collateral primarily consists of alt a mortgages which when originated were generally within typical fannie mae and freddie mac guidelines but had loan characteristics  which may have included higher loan balances  higher loan to value ratios or lower documentation requirements including stated income loans  that made them non conforming under those guidelines 
using historical losses  current portfolio statistics and market conditions and available market data  we have estimated future loan losses on the long term mortgage portfolio  which are included in the fair value adjustment to our securitized mortgage collateral 
while the credit performance for the loans has been clearly far worse than our initial expectations when the loans were originated  the ultimate level of realized losses will largely be influenced by events that will likely unfold over the next several years  including the recovery of the housing market and overall strength of the economy 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate in excess of our expectations  we may need to recognize additional fair value reductions to our securitized mortgage collateral  which may also affect the value of the related securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests 
we monitor our servicers to attempt to ensure that they perform loss mitigation  foreclosure and collection functions according to their servicing practices and each securitization trust pooling and servicing agreement 
we have met with the management of our servicers to assess our borrowers current ability to pay their mortgages and to make arrangements with selected delinquent borrowers which will result in the best interest of the trust and borrower  in an effort to minimize the number of mortgages which become seriously delinquent 
when resolving delinquent mortgages  servicers are required to take timely action 
the servicer is required to determine payment collection under various circumstances  which will result in the maximum financial benefit 
this is accomplished by either working with the borrower to bring the mortgage current by modifying the loan with terms that will maximize the recovery or by foreclosing and liquidating the property 
at a foreclosure sale  the trusts consolidated on our balance sheet generally acquire title to the property 

table of contents real estate risk residential property values are subject to volatility and may be negatively affected by numerous factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions such as unemployment and interest rate environment  local real estate conditions including housing inventory and foreclosures  and demographic factors 
decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could cause us to suffer losses 
prepayment risk we historically used prepayment penalties as a method of partially mitigating prepayment risk for those borrowers that have the ability to refinance 
the recent economic downturn  lack of available credit and declines in property values have limited borrowers ability to refinance 
these factors have significantly reduced prepayment risk within our long term mortgage portfolio 
with the seasoning of the long term mortgage portfolio  a significant portion of prepayment penalties terms have expired  thereby further reducing prepayment penalty income 
prepayment speed is a measurement of how quickly upb is reduced 
items reducing upb include normal monthly loan principal payments  loan refinancings  voluntary property sales and involuntary property sales such as foreclosures or short sales 
prepayment speed impacts future servicing fees  fair value of mortgage servicing rights and float income 
when prepayment speed increases  our servicing fees decrease faster than projected due to the shortened life of a portfolio 
our mortgage servicing rights fair value also decreases 
liquidity risk we are exposed to liquidity risks relating to our ongoing mortgage lending operations 
we primarily fund our mortgage lending originations through warehouse facilities with third party lenders 
we primarily use facilities with national and regional banks 
the warehouse facilities are secured by and used to fund single family residential mortgage loans 
in addition  the warehouse lenders require cash to be posted as additional collateral to secure the borrowings 
in order to mitigate the liquidity risk associated with warehouse borrowings  we attempt to sell our mortgage loans within days from acquisition or origination 
long term portfolio credit quality we use the mortgage bankers association mba method to define delinquency as a contractually required payment being or more days past due 
we measure delinquencies from the date of the last payment due date in which a payment was received

reo  which consists of residential real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans  is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value less estimated selling costs 
adjustments to the loan carrying value required at the time of foreclosure are included in the change in the fair value of net trust assets 
changes in our estimates of net realizable value subsequent to the time of foreclosure and through the time of ultimate disposition are recorded as gains or losses from real estate owned in the consolidated statements of operations 
reo  for continuing and discontinued operations  at december  decreased million or from december   as a result of liquidations and a decrease in foreclosures associated with foreclosure delays 
we realized gains on the sale of reo in the amount of thousand for  compared to losses of thousand for the comparable periods 
additionally  for the year ended december   we recorded a write down of the net realizable value of the reo in the amount of million  compared to write downs of million for the comparable period 
write downs of the net realizable value reflect declines in value of the reo subsequent to foreclosure date  but prior to the date of sale 
the following table presents the balances of the reo for continuing operations december  reo impairment ending balance reo inside trusts reo outside trusts total impairment represents the cumulative write downs of net realizable value subsequent to foreclosure 

table of contents in calculating the cash flows to assess the fair value of the securitized mortgage collateral  we estimate the future losses embedded in our loan portfolio 
in evaluating the adequacy of these losses  management takes many factors into consideration 
for instance  a detailed analysis of historical loan performance data is accumulated and reviewed 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  origination year and securitization issuance 
the data is also broken down by collection status 
our estimate of losses for these loans is developed by estimating both the rate of default of the loans and the amount of loss severity in the event of default 
the rate of default is assigned to the loans based on their attributes eg  original loan to value  borrower credit score  documentation type  geographic location  etc 
and collection status 
the rate of default is based on analysis of migration of loans from each aging category 
the loss severity is determined by estimating the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of the foreclosed property 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current mortgage portfolio and an estimate is created 
we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the future loan losses 
management recognizes that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring losses in the loan portfolios 
these items include  but are not limited to  economic indicators that may affect the borrower ability to pay  changes in value of collateral  political factors  employment and market conditions  competitor performance  market perception  historical losses  and industry statistics 
the assessment for losses is based on delinquency trends and prior loss experience and management judgment and assumptions regarding various matters  including general economic conditions and loan portfolio composition 
management continually evaluates these assumptions and various relevant factors affecting credit quality and inherent losses

net interest income we earn net interest income primarily from mortgage assets which include securitized mortgage collateral  loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale  or collectively  mortgage assets  and  to a lesser extent  interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense is primarily interest paid on borrowings secured by mortgage assets  which include securitized mortgage borrowings and warehouse borrowings and to a lesser extent  interest expense paid on long term debt and notes payable and line of credit 
interest income and interest expense during the period primarily represents the effective yield  based on the fair value of the trust assets and liabilities

net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest spread by total average interest earning assets 
net interest income spread decreased million for the year ended december  primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest spread on the long term mortgage portfolio due to increases in pricing and the corresponding reduction in investor yield requirements between periods on securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings as well as a decrease in the balance of the long term mortgage portfolio  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the note payable for the year ended december  additionally  the negative interest carry between the warehouse borrowings and loans held for sale is causing further reductions on the net interest spread 
as a result  net interest margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the yield on interest earning assets decreased to from in the comparable period 
the yield on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period 
in connection with the fair value accounting for investment securities available for sale and securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings  interest income and interest expense is recognized using effective yields based on estimated fair values for these instruments 
the decrease in yield for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings is primarily related to increased prices on mortgage backed bonds which resulted in a decrease in yield 
bond prices received from pricing services and other market participants have increased over the past few quarters as investor demand for mortgage backed securities has increased 
this has resulted in an increase in fair value for both

all estimated future losses are included in the estimate of the fair value of securitized mortgage collateral  reo and securitized mortgage borrowings 
losses on reo are reported separately in the consolidated statement of operations as reo is a nonfinancial asset which is the only component of trust assets and liabilities that is not recorded at fair value

liquidity and capital resources our results of operations and liquidity are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage related assets  as well as the broader financial markets and the general economy 
concerns over economic recession  geopolitical issues  unemployment  the availability and cost of financing  the mortgage market and real estate market conditions contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets

we believe that current cash balances  cash flows from our mortgage lending operations  real estate services fees generated from our long term mortgage portfolio  and residual interest cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio are adequate for our current operating needs 
however  we believe the mortgage and real estate services market is volatile  highly competitive and subject to increased regulation 
competition in mortgage lending comes primarily from mortgage bankers  commercial banks  credit unions and other finance companies which have offices in our market area as well as operations throughout the united states 
we compete for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees we charge  the types of loans we originate and the quality of services we provide to borrowers 
additionally  competition for loss mitigation servicing  loan modification services and other portfolio services has increased due to the difficult mortgage environment  credit tightening 
table of contents and an uncertain economy 
our competitors include mega mortgage servicers  established subprime loan servicers  and newer entrants to the specialty servicing and recovery collections business 
efforts to market our ability to provide mortgage and real estate services for others is more difficult than many of our competitors because we have not historically provided such services to unrelated third parties  and we are not a rated primary or special servicer of residential mortgage loans as designated by a rating agency 
additionally  performance of the long term mortgage portfolio is subject to the current real estate market and economic conditions 
cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations are sensitive to delinquencies  defaults and credit losses associated with the securitized loans 
losses in excess of current estimates will reduce the residual interest cash receipts from our long term mortgage portfolio 
while we continue to pay our obligations as they become due  the ability to continue to meet our current and long term obligations is dependent upon many factors  particularly our ability to successfully operate our mortgage lending segment  real estate services segment and realizing cash flows from the long term mortgage portfolio 
our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon the ability to expand our mortgage lending platform and profitability 
sources of liquidity cash flows from our mortgage lending operations 
we receive loan fees from loan originations 
fee income consists of application and underwriting fees and fees on cancelled loans 
these loan fees are offset by the related direct loan origination costs including broker fees related to our wholesale and correspondent channels 
in addition  we generally recognize net interest income on loans held for sale from the date of origination through the date of disposition 
in and continuing into  the borrowing rates on warehouse facilities exceeded loan note rates whereby we are experiencing net interest expense from the loans held for sale due to the recent interest rate environment creating a flat yield curve 
we sell or securitize substantially all of the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market  with servicing rights released or retained 
loans are sold on a whole loan basis by entering into sales transactions with third party investors in which we receive a premium for the loan and related servicing rights  if applicable 
the mortgage lending operations sold billion of mortgages through whole loan sales and securitizations during additionally  the mortgage lending operations enter into interest rate lock commitments irlcs and utilize forward sold fannie mae and ginnie mae mortgage backed securities hedging instruments to hedge the fair value changes associated with changes in interest rates relating to its mortgage loan origination operations 
we may be subject to pair off gains and losses associated with these hedging instruments 
since we rely significantly upon loan sales to generate cash proceeds to repay warehouse borrowings and to create credit availability  any disruption in our ability to complete sales may require us to utilize other sources of financing  which  if available at all  may be on less favorable terms 
in addition  delays in the disposition of our mortgages increase our risk by exposing us to credit and interest rate risk for this extended period of time 
fees from our mortgage and real estate service business activities

we receive residual cash flows on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral after distributions are made to investors on securitized mortgage borrowings to the extent required credit enhancements are maintained and performance covenants are complied with for credit ratings on the securitized mortgage 
table of contents borrowings 
these cash flows represent the difference between principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages  affected by the following servicing and master servicing fees paid  premiums paid to mortgage insurers  cash payments receipts on derivatives  interest paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  principal payments and prepayments paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  overcollateralization requirements  actual losses  net of any gains incurred upon disposition of other real estate owned or acquired in settlement of defaulted mortgages  unpaid interest shortfall  basis risk shortfall  and bond write downs reinstated

if the cumulative cash flows received  including the reserve account balance  from the collateralized residual interests are not sufficient to pay the required monthly principal and interest  we would be required to pay the difference to avoid the transfer of the residual interests and the rights to the associated future cash flows to the note holder 
to the extent there is excess cash flows after the reserve account reaches a balance of million  we will receive of the excess cash flows to a monthly maximum of thousand 
if the amount of restricted cash in the reserve account becomes sufficient to satisfy the remaining scheduled payments  the residuals listed as security can be released back to us

inflation 
the consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
for the years ended december  and  inflation had no significant impact on our revenues or net income 
unlike industrial 
table of contents companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater effect on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation
