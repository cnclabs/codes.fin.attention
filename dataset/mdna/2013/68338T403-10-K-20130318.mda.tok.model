item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes hereto 
management overview results and priorities revenue declined by to million from million in in sequential quarters  fourth quarter revenue declined by less than over the same period last year compared to a decline in the third quarter of compared to the same quarter of last year 
revenues are a lagging indicator of current operations because we primarily recognize revenue over the month subscriptions 
due to this policy  the impact of operational improvements is not immediately reflected in our financial results 
if our smb team continues to improve as expected  we anticipate year over year revenue growth to be positive in annual contract value  or acv  increased by to million as of december  from million as of december   our first positive year over year increase since we began our business transformation in in the fourth quarter  acv grew compared to the third quarter of growth of acv indicates that client retention rates are improving and new client acquisitions are beginning to scale 
we believe that acv represents the aggregate annual value of our subscription contracts and is a leading indicator of future revenue growth 
at december   onvia has  clients  down from  clients at december  our strategy is to continue to improve profitability by acquiring and managing fewer strategic clients at higher acvc 
as a result of this strategy  total clients declined in  a trend which we expect to continue in annual contract value per client  acvc  increased to  per client in the fourth quarter of compared to  in the fourth quarter of growth in acvc is a validation of our target market of companies that have a strategic interest in the public sector and we strive to provide these companies with exceptional value to help them win more government business 
operating expenses decreased to million compared to million in we continued to manage expenses and reallocate resources to high margin initiatives over the course of annual net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to net income of million  or cents per diluted share in due to our historical performance and future profitability projections we released million and  of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which resulted in the same amount being recognized as a tax benefit in our fourth quarter net income in and  respectively 
we will continue to review the estimate of future taxable income and will adjust the valuation allowance accordingly as new information becomes available 
excluding the effects of the valuation allowance  we had million of deferred tax assets related to million in net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable net income at december  as of december  we held cash and investments of million compared to million at the end of last year  representing an increase of million during our cash balance increased due to lower operating expenses  the timing of capital expenditures and improving acv 
over the last two years  onvia has transformed from a transactional lead generation vendor to a customer centric business intelligence partner for businesses with a strategic long term interest in the public sector 
we have redefined our target customer  identified their key objectives  and aligned our internal resources product  marketing  content and sales to deliver valuable solutions to meet and exceed our customer objectives 
by the end of we believe we have stabilized the core business 
we believe we are now well positioned to grow both revenue and net income in with our new business model offering a high percentage of recurring revenue  best in class customer retention and significant operating leverage 
we focused on four key priorities in  three of which were successful our first initiative was to continue to drive improvement in our smb sales organization 
all of our key metrics showed improvement in in the fourth quarter of acvc for smb was  a improvement over  in the same period last year 
higher acvc and an increase in transactions drove a sales increase of for smb acquisition in these positive results influenced our decision to scale the smb acquisition team by to salespeople in the fourth quarter of our second initiative was to continue to execute our product roadmap to enhance our solutions  further differentiate us from the competition  and be considered as a valued business intelligence provider to our clients 
we launched onvia which improved the customer experience and user navigation 
we introduced term contract center by publishing over  active term contracts  more coverage than any other source in our industry 
we launched the second update to spending forecast center providing project previews  a data mining tool  to allow our customers greater ability to find the most relevant information while searching the vast library of budgets and capital improvement plans 
our third initiative was to improve our marketing 
we positioned our brand as intelligence to win more government business reflecting the future direction of our product roadmap 
we revamped our lead generation program and enhanced our web site to improve leads volume and quality 
one initiative was not as successful as planned overall we were not successful with our initiative to build our enterprise business 
while our enterprise client retention improved in when compared with  new enterprise client acquisitions did not grow to the extent we planned 
in we stabilized the business  and we have identified four initiatives to accelerate growth in our first initiative is to scale the successful smb acquisition process with a team which is larger than last year 
the success of this initiative will be measured by improving acvc and the growth rate in acquisition sales year over year 
our second initiative is to maximize growth with our smb customer base 
we have proven that we can retain smb customers with a stronger solution and a well defined customer care program 
we believe that many of our clients are underserved and do not receive the optimal onvia solution for their public sector business objectives 
the success of this initiative will be measured by percentage increase in upsell revenue we are able to generate in when compared with our third initiative is to strengthen the value of our database and continue to add solutions to help our customers win more government business 
in we plan to launch onvia with a workflow user interface  introduce vendor intelligence for competitor and partner analytics  improve the workflow of our lead generation service and expand the agency intelligence that we provide to our customers 
the success of this initiative will be measured by our ability to deliver the roadmap on schedule and within budget 
our fourth initiative is to develop and begin to execute a strategy for enterprise sales that is scalable for we intend to define those enterprise accounts as prospects that are the best fit for onvia s value proposition and organize the sales force by vertical market 
our objective is to be in a position by the end of to scale enterprise in with the right people  process and solutions 
the success of this initiative will be measured by the development of this plan by the end of application of critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe the following are our most significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from subscriptions  content licenses and management reports 
our subscriptions are generally annual contracts  however  we also offer extended multi year contracts to our subscription clients  and content licenses are generally multi year agreements 
subscription and content licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also generate revenue from fees charged for management reports  document download services  and other services  and revenue from these types of services is recognized upon delivery  or  if report refreshes are included  ratably over the service period 
our subscription services and management information reports are also sold together as a bundled offering 
pursuant to the provisions of accounting standard codification  or asc  revenue recognition  we allocate revenue from these bundled sales ratably between the subscription services and the management reports based on their relative fair values  which are consistent with established list prices for those offerings 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu amends the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
we have adopted the amendments in this asu for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  adoption of this pronouncement did not materially impacted reported revenue 
unearned revenue consists of payments received for prepaid subscriptions  as well as the invoiced  but unpaid  portion of subscriptions and content licenses whose terms extend into periods beyond the balance sheet date 
internal use software we account for the costs to develop or obtain software for internal use in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other subtopic internal use software 
as a result  we capitalize qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage 
amortization of these costs begins once the product is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the product  typically to years 
the amount of costs capitalized within any period is dependent on the nature of software development activities and projects in each period 
during the first quarter of  assets that were nearly fully amortized related to aging search technology were replaced with a new platform 
onvia recorded an immaterial loss on this abandonment in operating expenses under the general and administrative category in the twelve months ended december  there were no impairments determined from our analysis in stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation according to the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of our stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
there is also significant judgment required in the estimation of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted 
please refer to the discussion of valuation assumptions in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information on the estimation of these variables 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record accounts receivable for the invoiced portion of our contracts once we have a signed agreement and amounts are billable under the contract 
all of our subscription contracts are non cancellable upon activation 
we do not record an asset for the unbilled or unearned portion of our contracts 
accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value  after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts 
such allowances are determined based on a review of an aging of accounts and reflect either specific accounts or estimates based on historical incurred losses 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain clients may be affected 
income taxes onvia accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  and for net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance has been established for the majority of the net deferred tax assets as the company has determined that the recognition criteria for realization have not been met 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to an ownership change that could occur in the future 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be deductible 
the company will continue to review the estimate of future taxable income and will adjust the valuation allowance accordingly as new information becomes available 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the non gaap financial measures we may disclose include adjusted ebitda and client metrics such as acv and acvc 
for a discussion regarding our client metrics  please refer the clients section of item business 
we typically disclose adjusted ebitda measures in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
adjusted ebitda is not a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other financial measures so calculated and presented  nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest and other non cash financing costs  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
other companies including our competitors may define adjusted ebitda differently 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe adjusted ebitda to be an important supplemental measure of performance that is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in similar industries and size 
management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting 
it may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor is it intended to be predictive of potential future results 
investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap 
the following table provides reconciliation of gaap net income to adjusted ebitda for the indicated periods in thousands year ended december  gaap net income reconciling items from gaap to adjusted ebitda interest and other income  net depreciation and amortization amortization of stock based compensation benefit for income tax adjusted ebitda consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue subscription content license management information reports other total revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses loss income from operations interest and other income  net loss income before income tax benefit for income taxes net income comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenues are a lagging indicator of current operations because we mainly recognize revenue on service agreements over the contract period 
due to this policy  the impact of operational improvements is not immediately reflected in our financial results 
we believe our declining year over year revenue is directly attributable to planned decline in non strategic clients 
cost of revenue cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue our cost of revenue primarily represents payroll related expenses associated with the capture  research and categorization of the data in our proprietary database and third party content fees  and also includes credit card processing fees 
the decrease for the comparable periods was primarily related to decrease in the third party content costs due to a strategic change in our production model 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the increase in expenses for the comparable periods is primarily comprised of  increase in payroll related expenses as a result of realignment of responsibilities of four employees who were included in general and administrative expenses in the prior period and are now included in sales and marketing expenses and higher commissionable sales   increase in amortization expenses related to new products launched in and  increase in travel expenses primarily due to increased travel to enterprise clients 
these increases were partially offset by  of internal software costs capitalized in compared to no capitalized internal software costs for the product team in due to the nature of product development efforts during each year 
technology and development technology and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the increase in expenses for the comparable periods is primarily attributed to a  increase in amortization expenses due to launch of new products in this change was offset in part by an  decrease in capitalized internal software costs primarily salaries and benefits attributable to the nature of development efforts during the year and other individually immaterial changes 
a smaller percentage of development efforts in were capitalized pursuant to asc  intangibles goodwill and other subtopic internal use software 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows in thousands increase decrease amount percent twelve months ended december  percentage of revenue the decrease in expenses for the comparable periods is primarily related to a  decrease in payroll related costs due to realignment of responsibilities of four employees who were included in general and administrative expenses in the prior period and are now included in sales and marketing expenses  a  decrease in facilities costs primarily related to lower rent expense due to the partial impairment of our office lease in  a  increase in amortization expenses due to launch of new products and other individually immaterial changes 
these decreases were offset by  increase in business taxes  primarily due to tax refund from the city of seattle received in other income  net other income  net consists of interest earned on our investment accounts  interest expense associated with capital leases and other miscellaneous income or expense 
other income  net was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and nol carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance has been established for the majority of the net deferred tax assets as we have determined that the recognition criteria for realization have not been met 
our valuation allowance reduces our deferred tax assets to a level that is more than likely than not to be recognized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider whether it is more likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be deductible 
we will continue to review the estimate of future taxable income and will adjust the valuation allowance accordingly as new information becomes available 
utilization of the nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to an ownership change that could occur in the future provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the code  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
we performed a section analysis and identified an ownership change that occurred in september we believe that  as a result of the annual section limitation that resulted from the change in control that occurred in september  we permanently will be unable to use a significant portion of our nol carryforward that arose before the change in control to offset our future taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   and our working capital was million 
from december  to december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million for the reasons described below under operating  investing and financing activities 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders or may include securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available  or that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due a reduction in operating expenses and improving acv 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchased million and million in short term investments during the twelve months of and  respectively 
during the twelve months of we received million from the sale and maturity of investments  compared to million during the same period of purchases of property and equipment and investments in our technology platform decreased by  in the twelve months of compared to the same period in in addition   and  of our security deposit on the lease for our corporate headquarters was returned to us in both march and march  respectively 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due to  reduction in proceeds from stock options exercises and a  in principal payments on capital lease for technology equipment in item a
