item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we were initially formed in as ghl acquisition corp  a special purpose acquisition company 
we acquired all the outstanding equity in iridium holdings llc  or iridium holdings  in a transaction accounted for as a business combination on september  we refer to this transaction as the acquisition 
we refer to iridium holdings  together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries  as iridium 
in accounting for the acquisition  ghl acquisition corp 
was deemed the legal and accounting acquirer and iridium the legal and accounting acquiree 
on september   we changed our name to iridium communications inc overview of our business we are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites 
we are the second largest provider of satellite based mobile voice and data communications services based on revenue  and the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage 
our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are impaired  including extremely remote or rural land areas  airways  open ocean  the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters 
we provide voice and data communications services to businesses  the us and foreign governments  non governmental organizations and consumers using our constellation of in orbit satellites and related ground infrastructure 
we utilize an interlinked  mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks 
this unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation  which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence 
we sell our products and services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network  encompassing more than service providers  value added resellers  or vars  and value added manufacturers  or vams  who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers  vars or dealers 
these distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific lines of business 
at december   we had approximately  billable subscribers worldwide  an increase of  or  from approximately  billable subscribers at december  we have a diverse customer base  including end users in the following lines of business land based handset  machine to machine  or mm  maritime  aviation  and government 
we recognize revenue from both the sale of equipment and the provision of services 
we expect a higher proportion of our future revenue will be derived from services 
voice and mm data service revenue have historically generated higher gross margins than subscriber equipment revenue 
we are currently devoting a substantial part of our resources to develop iridium next  our next generation satellite constellation  along with the development of new product and service offerings  upgrades to our current services  hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure and upgrades to our business systems 
we estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related ground infrastructure upgrades through to be approximately billion 
we believe our credit facility  described below  together with internally generated cash flows  including cash flows from hosted payloads and proceeds from our recent sale of series a cumulative convertible preferred stock  or the series a preferred stock  will be sufficient to fully fund the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related ground infrastructure upgrades through for more information about our sources of funding  see liquidity and capital resources 
full scale development and launch services agreements in june  we executed a primarily fixed price full scale development contract  or fsd  with thales alenia space france  or thales  for the design and manufacture of satellites for iridium next 
the total price under the fsd will be approximately billion  and we expect our payment obligations under the fsd to extend into the third quarter of as of december   we had made total payments of million to thales  which are classified within property and equipment  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in march  we entered into an agreement with space exploration technologies corp  or spacex  to secure spacex as the primary launch services provider for iridium next 
in august  we entered into an amendment to our launch services agreement with spacex 
the amendment reduced the number of contracted launches from eight to seven and increased the number of satellites to be carried on each launch vehicle from nine to ten 
the amendment also reduced the maximum price under the original spacex agreement from million to million 
as of december   we had made total payments of million to spacex  which are classified within property and equipment  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in june  we entered into an agreement with international space company kosmotras  or kosmotras  as a supplemental launch services provider for iridium next 
the agreement provides for the purchase of up to six launches and six additional launch options 
each launch can carry two satellites 
if we purchase all six launches  we will pay kosmotras a total of approximately million 
we expect to exercise an option to purchase one launch under the agreement which we plan to use for the first two iridium next satellites 
our payments to kosmotras for the single launch would be approximately million 
if we do not purchase any additional launches by march   the remaining options will expire 
as of december   we had made aggregate payments of million to kosmotras which are capitalized as construction in progress within property and equipment  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet

material trends and uncertainties our industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services  increased demand for communications services by the us department of defense  or dod  disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders  a broad and expanding wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets  a growing number of new products and services and related applications  improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings  regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services  a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment  and geographic market expansion through the receipt of licenses to sell our services in additional countries 
nonetheless  we face a number of challenges and uncertainties in operating our business  including our ability to develop iridium next and related ground infrastructure  and to develop products and services for iridium next  including our ability to continue to access the credit facility to meet our future capital requirements for the design  build and launch of the iridium next satellites  our ability to obtain sufficient internally generated cash flows  including cash flows from hosted payloads  to fund a portion of the costs associated with iridium next and support ongoing business  aireon s ability to successfully fund  develop and market its space based ads b global aviation monitoring service to be carried as a hosted payload on the iridium next system  our ability to maintain the health  capacity  control and level of service of our existing satellite network through the transition to iridium next  changes in general economic  business and industry conditions  our reliance on a single primary commercial gateway and a primary satellite network operations center  competition from other mobile satellite service providers and  to a lesser extent  from the expansion of terrestrial based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures  changes in demand from us government customers  particularly the dod  our ability to successfully negotiate a new contract with the dod when it expires later in  market acceptance of our products  regulatory requirements in existing and new geographic markets  rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry  reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products  services and applications effectively  reliance on single source suppliers for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand  natural disasters or other events  and reliance on the us government and a few significant distributors for a substantial portion of our revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition  collectability of accounts receivable  useful lives of property and equipment  long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  inventory  deferred financing costs  asset retirement obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  warranty expenses  loss contingencies  and other estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below
