item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for further information regarding forward looking statements  please refer to the special note regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms company  we  us and our refer to omeros corporation and nura  inc  its wholly owned subsidiary 
overview background we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing and commercializing products targeting inflammation  coagulopathies and disorders of the central nervous system 
our most clinically advanced products are derived from our proprietary pharmacosurgery platform designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients undergoing ophthalmological  arthroscopic  urological and other surgical and medical procedures 
our pharmacosurgery platform is based on low dose combinations of therapeutic agents delivered directly to the surgical site throughout the duration of the procedure to preemptively inhibit inflammation and other problems caused by surgical trauma and to provide clinical benefits both during and after surgery 
we currently have five clinical stage development programs 
in addition  we have a deep and diverse pipeline of preclinical programs as well as a platform capable of unlocking new drug targets 
for each of our products and programs  we have retained all manufacturing  marketing and distribution rights 
oms  one of our co lead pharmacosurgery products  successfully completed a phase clinical program that evaluated the product in patients undergoing ilr surgery 
this clinical program consisted of two trials that enrolled both cataract surgery and refractive lens exchange patients 
in both phase clinical trials  oms demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo in maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis pupil dilation and reduction of early postoperative pain 
we are now preparing to submit an nda to the fda during the first half of and an maa to the ema in mid to allow us to market and sell oms in the united states and the european union  respectively 
assuming approval of at least one of these marketing applications within approximately one year of its submission  we expect to begin marketing oms in omshp  our other co lead pharmacosurgery product  is being evaluated in a phase clinical program for its safety and ability to reduce pain following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery 
in december  we completed a phase clinical trial in which the pre specified primary endpoint was the symptoms subscale of the koos a patient reported measure that is comprised of questions about knee swelling  clicking  catching and stiffness 
in addition  pain measured in the early postoperative period was a pre specified secondary endpoint 
although the symptoms subscale of the koos did not reach statistical significance  omshp achieved statistically significant reduction of postoperative pain 
we are preparing to conduct a second phase clinical trial with reduction of early postoperative pain as the primary endpoint 
we expect to begin enrolling patients in this second clinical trial in the first half of in addition to oms and omshp  we have a pipeline of other product development programs targeting inflammation  coagulopathies and disorders of the central nervous system 
we have the following three clinical stage programs in our pipeline our pharmacosurgery product oms for use during urological surgery  including uroendoscopic procedures  that has completed a phase phase clinical trial  our pde program lead compound oms for the treatment of cognitive disorders  including schizophrenia and huntington s disease  that is currently being evaluated in healthy subjects in a phase clinical trial and in our 
table of contents pparg program two phase clinical trials are being conducted by our collaborators to evaluate a pparg agonist  alone or in combination with other agents  for treatment of addiction to opioids and to nicotine 
our preclinical programs include our masp program in which we are developing proprietary masp antibody therapies to treat disorders associated with complement activated inflammation our pde program in which we are developing proprietary compounds to treat movement disorders and addiction and compulsive disorders and our plasmin program in which we are advancing novel antifibrinolytic agents for the control of blood loss during surgery or resulting from trauma as well as for other hyperfibrinolytic states eg  liver disease 
in our gpcr program  we are working to complete high throughput surrogate de orphanization of orphan gpcrs  or the identification of synthetic molecules that bind and functionally interact with the receptors  and to develop products that act at these new potential drug targets 
as of february   we had announced that we have identified and confirmed sets of compounds that interact selectively with  and modulate signaling of  class a orphan gpcrs 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement with vulcan pursuant to which we received million for our gpcr program 
also during the same quarter  we entered into an agreement with the lsdf under which we received a million grant award that was paid to reimburse us for expenses we incurred and equipment purchases related to our gpcr program 
in exchange for these payments  we agreed to pay to vulcan and lsdf a portion of any net proceeds that we receive from the gpcr program 
we also issued to the vulcan affiliate three warrants to purchase our common stock  each with a five year term and exercisable for up to  shares  with exercise prices of  and per share  respectively 
we recognized net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in connection with research and development activities  consisting primarily of clinical trials  preclinical studies and manufacturing services associated with our current products 
compared to  we expect our net losses to increase as we continue to advance our clinical trials  expand our research and development efforts  add personnel for our anticipated growth and prepare for the commercial launch of oms  if it is approved 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total shareholders deficit was million 
revenue our revenue to date has consisted of grant funding from third parties and revenue recognized in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf 
other than grant funding  we do not expect to receive any revenue from our products until we receive regulatory approval and commercialize the products or until we potentially enter into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products 
as discussed below  we do not expect any of our current products to be commercially available before  if at all 
we continue to pursue government and private grant funding as well as collaboration funding for our products and research programs 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  which include clinical trial and third party manufacturing services 
internal research and development costs are recognized as incurred 
third party research and development costs are expensed at the earlier of when the contracted work has been performed or when upfront and milestone payments are made 
research and development expenses include employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  cros  clinical trial sites  and collaborators or licensors  
table of contents facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  and third party supplier expenses including laboratory and other supplies 
our research and development expenses can be divided into clinical research and development and preclinical research and development activities 
the following table illustrates our expenses associated with these activities years ended december  in thousands direct external expenses clinical research and development oms omshp pde other clinical programs total clinical research and development preclinical research and development total direct external expenses internal  overhead and other expenses stock based compensation expense total research and development expenses direct external clinical research and development expenses consist primarily of external research and development and regulatory expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  cros  clinical trial sites  collaborators  licensors and consultants 
direct external preclinical research and development expenses consist primarily of our preclinical research activities  laboratory supplies and consulting 
internal  overhead and other expenses consist of personnel costs and other overhead costs such as rent  utilities and depreciation 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple clinical and preclinical projects that we are advancing in parallel 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our products for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product  as well as on going assessments of each product s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which products may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our products requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not expect any of our current products to be commercially available before  if at all 
because of the factors above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to higher revenue that we recognized from both the vulcan agreement and nih grants for preclinical research 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue recognized under our agreements with lsdf and smri given that all remaining revenue under those agreements was recognized during the first quarter of and second quarter of  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher expenses related to our oms phase clinical program  advancing our pde and masp programs into and toward the clinic  respectively  our gpcr program  and increased legal costs and employee compensation  including non cash stock based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by lower expenses in our omshp program and in several of our preclinical programs  including our pde and plasmin programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to higher legal costs  marketing expenses tied to the planned commercial launch of oms and employee compensation  including non cash stock based compensation 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased in due to a lower average notes payable balance 
other income  net 
other income  net was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on march   we extended the expiration date of warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and recognized other expense of  in connection with the warrant modification 
the remaining decrease relates primarily to lower rental income received under our subleases 
comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to higher revenue that we recognized from our agreements with vulcan and lsdf  partially offset by a decrease in revenue recognized in connection with the completion of preclinical research funded by nih grants 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher expenses associated with our oms phase clinical program and higher gpcr program expenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower expenses associated with the completion of our phase program evaluating omshp in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and lower one time licensing fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the replacement of our initial committed equity line financing facility with azimuth and lower employee expenses 
investment income 
investment income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is due primarily to lower average investment balances in 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense increased in due to a higher average notes payable balance 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was  for the year ended december  and relates entirely to losses incurred as a result of the refinancing of our debt with oxford 
other income  net 
other income  net was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to income received from the us qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities for proceeds totaling million  million of which we received  net of expenses  from the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a public offering completed on july   two debt facilities with loan proceeds totaling million  with million of proceeds from the second facility used to pay off the remaining balance of the first facility  and our gpcr program funding agreement with vulcan pursuant to which we received million 
additionally  we received a million cash lease incentive payment in the first quarter of related to our new office and laboratory lease with bmr elliott avenue llc  or bmr  for the omeros building 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances are held principally in interest bearing instruments  including money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with established guidelines to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and capital that we may be able to raise under our agreements with mlv or azimuth will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and note payments for at least the next months 
comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were primarily related to research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
the increase was primarily due to higher costs to support our phase oms clinical program  our masp  gpcr and pde programs as well as higher employee costs 
these increases were partially offset by the million cash lease incentive payment that we received from bmr during the first quarter of investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  investing activities  other than purchases and sales of short term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect cash used to purchase short term investments and receipts from the sale of short term investments  thus causing a shift between our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to the understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided from financing activities in was due primarily to million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our public offering in july and million in net proceeds from our debt refinancing in december net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of our borrowing million under the second tranche of our loan from oxford in march in both periods  net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by principal payments on our notes payable 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were primarily related to research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
cash used to fund operating activities was lower for the year ended december   primarily due to the cash received from our vulcan agreement  which was recorded as deferred revenue in and is being amortized to revenue as research is performed 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
in  investing activities also included our acquisition of intellectual property assets from patobios and our subsequent reimbursement of the purchase price by vulcan 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect cash used to purchase short term investments and receipts from the sale and maturity of short term investments  thus causing a shift between our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to the understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our borrowing of the second million tranche from oxford in march  partially offset by principal payments to oxford  which began in november net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily due to the payoff of our loan from bluecrest venture finance master fund limited  partially offset by proceeds received from the first million tranche of our oxford loan 
mlv at the market agreement in december  we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement  or the sales agreement  with mlv pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million directly on the nasdaq global market or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange 
with our prior written consent  sales may also be made in negotiated transactions and or any other method permitted by law 
mlv will receive a commission from the gross proceeds of any sales 
subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement  mlv will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares of our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other parameters or conditions that we may impose 
we are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the sales agreement and no assurance can be given that we will sell any shares under the sales agreement  or  if we do  as to the price or amount of shares that we will sell  or the dates on which any such sales will take place 
the sales agreement may be terminated by either party at any time upon days notice to the other party  or by mlv at any time in certain circumstances  including the occurrence of a material adverse effect to omeros 
in addition  the sales agreement will automatically terminate upon the sale of all common stock subject to the sales agreement 
azimuth committed equity line financing facility in may  we entered into a committed equity line financing facility with azimuth pursuant to which we are permitted to sell up to million of our shares of common stock over a month term 
this facility replaced a prior committed equity line financing facility  which we entered into with azimuth on july  but had not accessed 
under the agreement with azimuth  we may  from time to time over the month term and in our sole discretion  present azimuth with draw down notices requiring azimuth to purchase a specified dollar amount of shares of our common stock  based on the volume weighted average price per share on each of consecutive trading days  or the draw down period  with the total dollar amount of each draw down subject to 
table of contents certain agreed upon limitations based on the market price of our common stock at the time of the draw down 
the purchase price for these shares equals the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount ranging from to  based on a minimum price that we specify 
we are allowed to present azimuth with up to draw down notices during the month term  with only one such draw down notice allowed per draw down period and a minimum of five trading days required between each draw down period 
we may not issue more than  shares in connection with the committed equity line financing facility  although this limitation does not apply if the average purchase price of all shares issued to azimuth  taking into account all discounts  equals or exceeds per share  which amount is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the facility 
we have not drawn down funds under this facility to date and it will expire on june  unless we and azimuth mutually agree to extend it 
because the facility will expire on june   taking into account its limitations described above  we believe that the amount of committed proceeds that we could raise before june  would be significantly less than million 
we are unable to estimate the actual amount as it depends on the price of our stock at the time we use the facility 
in connection with this facility  we entered into a placement agent agreement with reedland capital partners  an institutional division of financial west group  member finra sipc  or fwg reedland 
we have agreed to pay fwg reedland  upon each sale of our common stock to azimuth under the facility  a fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth 
stanley medical research institute funding agreement in december  we entered into a funding agreement with smri to develop a proprietary product that inhibits pde for the treatment of schizophrenia 
under the agreement  we may receive grant and equity funding upon achievement of product development milestones through phase clinical trials totaling million  subject to our mutual agreement with smri 
as of december   we had received million from smri  million of which was recorded as revenue and million of which was recorded as equity funding 
oxford loan and security agreement in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with oxford pursuant to which oxford agreed to lend us up to million in two tranches of million each 
we borrowed the first tranche in october  or tranche  and the second tranche in march  or tranche on december   we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement  or the amendment  pursuant to which we borrowed an additional million  or tranche  and amended the repayment terms of the existing outstanding indebtedness under tranche and tranche the amendment provides for interest only payments on tranche  tranche and tranche through december  beginning on january   payments of principal and interest are payable monthly  in arrears 
all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable on the maturity date  december  as a result of tranche  our total outstanding principal to oxford was million as of december  interest on the million accrues at an annual fixed rate of 
we are using the proceeds from tranche for working capital and general business purposes 
prior to the amendment  upon borrowing tranche and tranche  we recorded a  discount on the notes related to a final payment fee and we capitalized in other assets  in debt issuance costs 
both the discount and the debt issuance costs were amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the repayment term of the initial loan amount 
in connection with the amendment  we paid  for the prorated portion of the  final payment due under tranche and tranche with no further obligation for the remaining  we accounted for the amendment as a debt modification rather than an extinguishment of debt 
accordingly  the remaining unamortized costs associated with the original debt will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the amended repayment term 

table of contents in connection with the amendment  we agreed to pay oxford a final payment fee equal to of the borrowed million  or million  which we recorded as a discount on the outstanding debt 
the final payment fee will be due upon the last payment date of the amounts we borrowed  whether upon maturity on december   or on the date of any prepayment of such amounts or in the event of acceleration upon a default 
we also capitalized in other assets  in debt issuance costs that we incurred 
both of these amounts are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the amended repayment term 
as of december   unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with the modified debt was million and  respectively 
we may prepay the outstanding principal balance in its entirety  plus accrued and unpaid interest  at any time upon delivery of prior notice to oxford and the payment of a prepayment fee equal to of the then outstanding principal amount  which prepayment fee would be waived if we refinance the indebtedness with oxford 
as security for its obligations under the loan agreement  we granted oxford a security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
the loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness  grant liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  make investments  make acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make distributions  or repurchase stock  in each case subject to customary exceptions for a loan agreement of this size and type 
the loan agreement contains no cash covenant 
the loan agreement includes customary events of default that include  among other things  non payment  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  covenant breach  occurrence of a material adverse effect  or mae  cross default to material indebtedness  bankruptcy or insolvency  material judgment defaults  and a change of control 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness to oxford 
under certain circumstances  a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the loan agreement at a per annum rate equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
mae is defined in the loan agreement as a material adverse effect upon i the business operations  properties  assets  results of operations or financial condition of omeros  taken as a whole with respect to our viability  that reasonably would be expected to result in our inability to repay any portion of the loans in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  ii the validity  perfection  value or priority of oxford s security interest in the collateral  iii the enforceability of any material provision of the loan agreement or related agreements or iv the ability of oxford to enforce its rights and remedies under the loan agreement or related agreements 
we considered the mae definition and believe that the mae clause has not been triggered as of december  carolina casualty insurance company litigation under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed in item legal proceedings to this annual report on form k  we made a one time payment of million to mr 
klein to release all of his claims  which included a claim for payment of his attorneys fees since incurred in connection with the lawsuit 
as of december   we recorded million as litigation settlement on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
as also described in item legal proceedings to this annual report on form k  we are currently engaged in litigation with ccic  which was the carrier for our directors  officers and corporate liability insurance policy in effect at the time mr 
klein s employment with us was terminated 
on november  ccic reimbursed us million for the payment we made to mr 
klein as well as related employment taxes we paid 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded million as a recovery on settlement on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
ccic made this payment without waiving any of its rights  including a potential claim seeking recovery of the million  and without affecting any of our or our chief executive officer s counterclaims against it  including for failure to 
table of contents defend and bad faith 
as of march   ccic has not amended its complaint to seek such recovery  but may choose to do so in the future 
the ultimate financial impact of this action is not yet determinable 
if we are required to repay to ccic the settlement funds or any part of our defense costs and fees borne by ccic  or both  our financial position may be materially negatively affected 
funding requirements because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our products  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital requirements and operating expenditures required in the future 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our preclinical and clinical programs  costs related to manufacturing services  whether the hiring of a number of new employees to support our continued growth during this period will occur at salary levels consistent with our estimates  the terms and timing of payments of any collaborative or licensing agreements that we have or may establish  the cost  timing and outcomes of the regulatory processes for our products  the costs of commercialization activities  including product manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to these types of transactions  whether we receive grant funding for our programs  the extent to which we raise capital by selling our stock through our at the market equity facility with mlv  under which mlv is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our stock in accordance with our instructions  the extent to which we raise capital from azimuth under our committed equity line financing facility  which will expire on june  unless we and azimuth mutually agree to extend it  the extent to which we otherwise access the capital markets  and the amount of revenue we generate from the sale of our products  which revenue we do not expect until at least we expect our continuing operating losses to result in an increasing total amount of cash used in operations over the next several years 
to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
if we do not raise additional capital through equity or debt financings and or one or more corporate partnerships  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our planned commercialization efforts 
except for our committed equity line financing facility with azimuth which expires on june   we currently do not have any commitments for future external equity or debt funding 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and any future equity funding will dilute the ownership of our equity investors 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due within year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases license maintenance fees capital leases principal and interest notes payable principal and interest total we currently lease our office and laboratory space in the omeros building under the lease with bmr 
the initial term of the lease ends in november and we have two options to extend the lease term  each by five years 
we have received net lease incentives of million  which were recorded as deferred rent on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for additional discussion of the lease 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding 
we may also be required to make royalty and milestone payments that are not listed in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for a description of the agreements that include these royalty and milestone payment obligations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical judgment by management and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  research and development expenses  primarily clinical trial expenses  and stock based compensation 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 

table of contents revenue recognition the accounting standard for revenue provides a framework for accounting for revenue arrangements 
a variety of factors are considered in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under revenue arrangements  such as whether the various elements can be considered separate units of accounting  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
our revenue relates to grant funding from third parties and revenue recognized in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf 
we recognize such funds as revenue when the related qualifying research and development expenses are incurred up to the limit of the approved funding amounts 
funds received in advance of services being provided are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as research is performed 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised primarily of employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  cros and clinical trial sites  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  third party supplier expenses  including laboratory and other supplies  and payments to collaborators and licensors 
clinical trial expenses for investigational sites require certain estimates 
we estimate these costs based on a cost per patient that varies depending on the clinical trial site 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our estimates  these changes in estimates may result in understated or overstated expenses at a given point in time 
internal and third party research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized on the straight line method as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value as of the grant date 
the fair value of our stock options is calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of various subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
as stock based compensation expense is based on options ultimately expected to vest  the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience  separate groups of employees that have similar historical forfeiture behavior are considered separately for expense recognition 
stock options granted to non employees are accounted for using the fair value approach 
the fair value of non employee option grants are estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and are re measured over the vesting term as earned 
the estimated fair value is charged to expense over the applicable service period 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update  or asu  related to the presentation of comprehensive income that requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminated the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this standard  which 
table of contents must be applied retroactively  was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted the standards on january  and now present a combined statement of operations and comprehensive loss in our accompanying financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily confined to interest rate risk that may affect our investment securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have invested these funds in highly liquid  investment grade securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates and with our current portfolio of short term investments  we are not exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates
