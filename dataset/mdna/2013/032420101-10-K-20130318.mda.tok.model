overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel small molecule therapeutics derived from our boron chemistry platform 
the productivity of our internal discovery capability has enabled us to generate a pipeline of both topical and systemic boron based compounds 
we have discovered  synthesized and developed eight molecules that are currently in development 
our lead product candidates include two topically administered dermatologic compounds tavaborole formerly referred to as an  an antifungal for the treatment of onychomycosis  and an  an anti inflammatory for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
in addition  we have three wholly owned clinical product candidates an and an  which are backup compounds to tavaborole and an  respectively  and an formerly referred to as gsk  or gsk  an antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by gram negative bacteria  which previously was licensed to glaxosmithkline llc  or gsk 
in october  gsk advised us that it had discontinued further development of an  accordingly  all rights to this compound reverted to us 
we are considering our options for further development  if any  of this compound 
we have also discovered three other compounds that we have out licensed for further development two are licensed to eli lilly and company  or lilly  for the treatment of animal health indications and the third compound  an  also referred to as scyx  is licensed to drugs for neglected diseases initiative  or dndi  for human african trypanosomiasis hat  or sleeping sickness 
we also have a pipeline of other internally discovered topical and systemic boron based compounds in development 
our most advanced product candidate is tavaborole 
we initiated our phase clinical trials for tavaborole in the fourth quarter of and completed enrollment for these trials in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we reported positive results from both phase trials conducted under a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
tavaborole achieved a high degree of statistical significance on all primary and secondary endpoints 
in the first trial  of patients treated with tavaborole met the primary endpoint of complete cure  compared with of patients treated with vehicle p at week in the second trial  of patients treated with tavaborole met the primary endpoint of complete cure  compared with of patients treated with vehicle p at week complete cure is a composite endpoint that requires both a mycological cure and a completely clear nail 
in addition  we completed a cardiac safety study and a repeat insult patch test  or ript  study in november we are currently in the process of preparing to file a new drug application  or nda  in mid for an  we completed a phase dose ranging trial in psoriasis in the second quarter of  a second phase clinical trial in psoriasis in the second quarter of and a phase absorption trial in the third quarter of we also completed a phase trial of an and an  our second topical anti inflammatory product candidate  in mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in the fourth quarter 
table of contents of in early  we completed two safety studies of an given the positive outcome from our atopic dermatitis trial  the safety profile exhibited by an and the large unmet need in atopic dermatitis relative to psoriasis  we intend to focus our an development efforts on atopic dermatitis in the near future and defer the start of the phase trial for psoriasis 
as such  we initiated a phase safety  pharmacokinetics  or pk  and efficacy trial for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adolescents in july and a phase dose ranging study in mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adolescents in august we completed the phase safety  pk and efficacy trial in december and expect results from our phase dose ranging study in march our future development plans for an will be determined following the results of our phase dose ranging study 
in october  we entered into a research and development collaboration  option and license agreement with gsk for the discovery  development and worldwide commercialization of boron based systemic anti infectives 
in september  we amended and expanded the gsk agreement to  among other things  provide gsk the option to extend its rights around the bacterial enzyme target leucyl trna synthetase  or leurs  as well as to add a new research program using our boron chemistry platform for tuberculosis  or tb  and gsk is currently funding our tb research activities 
the amendment also gives gsk options to initiate an additional collaborative research program directed towards leurs and to acquire rights to certain specified compounds from anacor malaria program  which is currently being conducted through a collaboration with medicines for malaria venture  or mmv 
none of the compounds currently being evaluated as potential lead candidates under this program are subject to gsk option 
in august  we entered into a research  license and commercialization agreement with lilly  under which we are collaborating to discover products for a variety of animal health applications 
pursuant to this agreement  lilly selected the first development compound for an animal health indication in august  and in december  they selected a second development compound for another animal health indication 
lilly will be responsible for all further development and commercialization of these compounds 
in february  we entered into a research and development collaboration with medicis pharmaceutical corporation  or medicis  to discover and develop compounds directed against a target for the potential treatment of acne 
on november   we filed for arbitration with jams for breach of contract by medicis seeking damages in the form of payment for the achievement of certain preclinical milestones under the collaboration 
on december   medicis filed a complaint for breach of the collaboration and a motion for preliminary injunction in the delaware court of chancery seeking to enjoin us from prosecuting our claims through arbitration and to require us to continue to use diligent efforts to conduct research and development under the agreement 
on january   we filed a motion requesting that the delaware court of chancery dismiss the medicis suit and send the dispute back to arbitration 
on february   medicis filed a brief in opposition to our motion to dismiss in favor of arbitration 
on march   we filed a reply brief in support of our motion to dismiss 
we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under the collaboration and believe that we have meritorious defenses against medicis filed complaint and motion 
medicis was acquired by valeant in december we also have several collaborations with organizations that fund research leveraging our boron chemistry to discover new treatments for neglected diseases 
in addition to potentially developing new therapies for such diseases  these collaborations provide us the potential benefits of expanding the chemical diversity of our boron compounds  understanding new properties of our boron compounds  receiving future incentives  such as the potential grant of a priority review voucher by the fda and  if a drug is ultimately approved  potential revenue in some regions 
our collaboration partners include dndi to develop new therapeutics for hat  visceral leishmaniasis and chagas disease  mmv to develop compounds for the treatment of malaria  the sandler center for drug discovery at the university of california at san francisco to discover new drug therapies for the treatment of river blindness  the global alliance for livestock veterinary medicines  or galvmed  for the treatment of 
table of contents animal african trypanosomiasis and the university of california at san francisco to develop compounds for the treatment of malaria under a national institutes of health grant 
in  dndi completed pre clinical studies of an for hat and  in march  an became the first compound from our neglected diseases initiatives to enter human clinical trials 
in february  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock in connection with an underwriting agreement  or the canaccord underwriting agreement  with canaccord genuity inc  or canaccord 
the price to the public in this offering was per share  for gross proceeds of approximately million  and canaccord purchased the shares from us pursuant to the canaccord underwriting agreement at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs 
in october  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement  or the cowen underwriting agreement  with cowen company  llc  or cowen 
the price to the public in this offering was per share for gross proceeds of million  and cowen purchased the shares from us pursuant to the cowen underwriting agreement at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to us from this offering were approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs 
we began business operations in march to date  we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have never been profitable 
as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments received under our agreements with schering corporation  or schering  gsk  lilly and medicis  government contracts and grants  contracts with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases and borrowings under debt arrangements 
we expect to incur losses in future periods 
the size of our future losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth of our expenses  our ability to enter into additional licensing  research and development agreements and future payments earned under our agreements with gsk  lilly  medicis or any such future collaboration partners 
our intent is to enter into additional licensing and development agreements to further develop certain of our product candidates and to fund other areas of our research 
if the gsk  lilly and or medicis agreements are terminated or we are unable to enter into other collaboration agreements  we may incur additional operating losses and our ability to expand and continue our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of development may be limited 
while management believes that we currently have sufficient resources to fund our operations until the filing of our nda  additional capital will be needed to complete the development and potential commercialization of tavaborole  fund the other research and development activities and meet our operating requirements through and beyond 
to fund our future operations  including research  development and commercialization of our product candidates  we will need to seek additional capital through research and development collaborations  a possible license  collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to commercialization rights to tavaborole or our other product candidates  equity offerings or debt financings  or a combination of these sources 
financial operations overview revenues our recent revenues are comprised primarily of collaboration agreement related revenues and government grants  while historically we also had government contract revenues 
collaboration agreement related revenues have included license fees  development reimbursements and development milestone fees 
in addition  we received an amendment fee in in connection with the modification of our research and development collaboration with gsk  or the amendment fee  and a termination and release payment in with respect to our previous agreement with schering 
government grant revenues have consisted of grant funding received from government entities and government contract revenues have included cost and cost plus fixed fee reimbursements for allowable costs 

table of contents we have generated approximately million in revenue from inception through december  through  we had recognized cumulative revenues of million through our contract with the us department of defense for the development of antibiotics against infective anthrax 
in september  we were awarded a million national institutes of health  or nih  grant for the identification of targets for certain antifungal compounds  which included work on the mechanism of action of tavaborole 
in march  we received from schering a million upfront fee that was recognized ratably over the estimated period during which we performed development related activities to transition tavaborole to schering 
the estimated period was based on the research transition plan jointly developed by schering and us 
in addition to the upfront fee  we were paid for our development related activities  which included certain preclinical and clinical activities 
inception to date  we have recognized revenue of million under the schering agreement  which was comprised of the full recognition of the million upfront fee and million for our development related transition activities 
in november  schering merged with merck co  inc  or merck  and in may  upon termination of the agreement  we regained the exclusive worldwide rights to tavaborole and received a million payment from merck  which was recognized as revenue during in october  we received a million upfront fee under our agreement with gsk  which was being recognized ratably over the six year research term 
in september  the remaining million of deferred revenue was recognized upon the amendment of the contract  as was the million amendment fee we received that month 
through december   we recognized million under this agreement  which was comprised of million related to the upfront fee  million for achievement of performance milestones  million for the amendment fee  million related to reimbursement for the tb program and million in reimbursement for patent costs  procurement of drug material and performance of certain clinical studies for an in october  gsk discontinued further development of an  accordingly  all rights to this compound reverted to us 
we are considering our options for further development  if any  of this compound 
in the future  revenue under our agreement with gsk may include fees for our gsk product candidates achieving specified development  regulatory and sales goals and product royalties 
in september  we received a non creditable  non refundable upfront fee of million under our agreement with lilly  which we are recognizing ratably over the four year research term on a straight line basis 
under this agreement  we have received million in research funding through december  with the potential to receive up to a total of million in research funding  if neither party cancels the agreement prior to the completion of the research term 
through december   we have recognized million under this agreement  which was comprised of million related to the upfront fee  million in research funding and million in milestone fees for the selection of development compounds 
in october  we were awarded million from the united states department of the treasury under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program to support research for six projects with the potential to produce new therapies 
the full amount was recognized as government grant revenue in in february  we received a non creditable  non refundable upfront fee of million under our agreement with medicis  which we are recognizing ratably over the six year research term on a straight line basis 
through december   we have recognized million of the upfront fee 
from inception through december   we have recognized million of revenue for research relating to animal health indications and for research performed under our agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  are recognized as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  contract research organizations and investigational sites  employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and consulting fees  third party supplier expenses  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  amortization or depreciation of leasehold improvements  equipment and laboratory supplies and other expenses 
our expenses associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of the services provided and the status of the related activities 
we expect that research and development expenses will remain comparable in the future as we progress our product candidates through clinical development  conduct our research and development activities under our agreements with gsk  lilly  medicis and various current and potential collaborations  including those related to our neglected diseases initiatives  advance our discovery research projects into the preclinical stage and continue our early stage research 
the table below sets forth our research and development expenses for  and  and for the period from january  through december   for four of our clinical stage product candidates  other work conducted under the gsk agreement  work on our lilly and medicis collaborations and work on neglected diseases and other programs  including programs that are currently inactive 
prior to january   we did not separately track expenses for tavaborole or any other product candidates due to the early stage of their development 
a portion of our research and development costs  including indirect costs relating to our product candidates  are not tracked on a program by program basis and are allocated based on the personnel resources assigned to each program 
year ended december  total from january  to december  in thousands tavaborole  including nih grant expenses an an an previously gsk gsk programs lilly programs medicis program neglected diseases other programs total research and development expenses we expect our research and development expenses for tavaborole to decrease in the near future due to the completion of our tavaborole clinical activities and the filing of our nda in mid we 
table of contents expect costs associated with an to increase as we expand the clinical and preclinical activities for this program 
in october  gsk advised us that it had discontinued further development of an and all rights to this compound reverted to us 
we are considering our options for further development  if any  of this compound 
we also expect costs associated with our early stage research activities on our lilly collaborations to increase in future periods 
we expect our spending associated with the medicis program to be limited until our current dispute with them is resolved 
in addition  spending for our early stage research programs  including our gsk tb program and other potential gsk programs  will be dependent upon our success in developing and advancing new product candidates for these programs 
we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if  when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
we or our collaboration partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
the duration  costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors  including the uncertainties of future clinical and preclinical studies  uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates and significant and changing government regulation and whether our current or future collaborators are committed to  and make progress in  programs licensed to them 
in addition  the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors  including competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
consequently  we are unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the period in which material cash inflows will be received 
we will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an assessment of each product candidate commercial potential 
our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
to the extent that such third parties have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates  we will be dependent upon their efforts for the progress of such product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel  including stock based compensation and travel expenses  in executive  finance  business development and other administrative functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  consulting costs associated with financial services  professional fees for legal services  including patent related services  and auditing and tax services 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our operating activities  hire additional staff and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  preclinical study and clinical trial accruals  deferred advance payments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and 
table of contents review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of our financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our contract revenues are generated primarily through research and development collaboration agreements  which typically may include non refundable  non creditable upfront fees  funding for research and development efforts  payments for achievement of specified development  regulatory and sales goals and royalties on product sales of licensed products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of technology has been completed  services are performed or products have been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we evaluate each deliverable to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
the selling price used for each unit of accounting will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 
our management may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting and in estimating the selling prices of identified units of accounting for new agreements 
where multiple deliverables are combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are recognized based on the performance requirements of the related agreement 
upfront payments for licensing our intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the licensee can obtain stand alone value from the license separate from the value of the research and development services to be provided by us 
typically  we have determined that the licenses we have granted to collaborators do not have stand alone value separate from the value of the research and development services provided 
as such  upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as contract revenue ratably over the contractual or estimated performance period that is consistent with the term of the research and development obligations contained in the research and development collaboration agreement 
when stand alone value is identified  the related consideration is recorded as revenue in the period in which the license or other intellectual property rights are issued 
some arrangements involving the licensing of our intellectual property  the provision of research and development services or both may also include exclusivity clauses whereby we agree that  for a specified period of time  we will not conduct further research on licensed compounds or on compounds that would compete with licensed compounds or that we will do so only on a limited basis 
such provisions may also restrict the future development or commercialization of such compounds 
we do not treat such exclusivity clauses as a separate element within an arrangement and any upfront payments received related to the exclusivity clause would be allocated to the identified elements in the arrangement and recognized as described in the preceding paragraph 
payments resulting from our efforts under research and development agreements or government grants are recognized as the activities are performed and are presented on a gross basis 
revenue is recorded gross because we act as a principal  with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services 
the costs associated with these activities are reflected as a component of research and development expense in our statements of operations and the revenues recognized from such activities approximate the related costs 

table of contents for certain contingent payments under research or development arrangements  we recognize revenue using the milestone method 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to us 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is judgmental and is made at the inception of the arrangement 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is i commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
in making the determination as to whether a milestone is substantive or not  we consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the arrangement  including factors such as the scientific  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether any portion of the milestone consideration is related to future performance or deliverables 
other contingent payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaboration partner performance  or bonus payments  are not accounted for using the milestone method 
such bonus payments will be recognized as revenue when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties based on reported sales of licensed products will be recognized based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  none of our products have been approved and therefore we have not earned any royalty revenue from product sales 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals and deferred advance payments we estimate preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct these activities on our behalf 
in recording service fees  we estimate the time period over which the related services will be performed and compare the level of effort expended through the end of each period to the cumulative expenses recorded and payments made for such services and  as appropriate  accrue additional service fees or defer any non refundable advance payments until the related services are performed 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust our accrual or deferred advance payment accordingly 
if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
to date  we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial accruals 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period 
stock option awards granted to our nonemployee directors for their board related services are included in employee stock based compensation in accordance with current accounting standards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock based awards and use the straight line single option method for expense attribution 
we estimate forfeitures and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 

table of contents we account for equity instruments issued to nonemployees based on their fair values on the measurement dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of the options granted to nonemployees are remeasured as they vest 
as a result  the noncash charge to operations for nonemployee options that vest in any given reporting period is affected by changes in the fair value of our common stock during that period 
we recorded noncash stock based compensation for employee and nonemployee stock option grants and employee stock purchase program  or espp  stock purchase rights of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as of december   there were outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock and we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  related to outstanding stock options and  related to espp stock purchase rights that will be recognized over weighted average periods of years and years  respectively 
there were  common shares purchased under the espp for the year ended december  we expect to continue to grant stock options and espp stock purchase rights in the future and  if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands contract revenue research and development expenses general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt other income expense includes the following stock based compensation expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses contract revenue 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues of million for research funding  million for a development milestone earned and million of the million upfront fee received under the lilly agreement  million of the million upfront fee received under the medicis agreement and million primarily for research funding under our collaboration agreement with gsk 
we also recognized million for research work performed under other research and development agreements  including our agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of the original upfront fee received from gsk  including million as a result of the material modification of our gsk agreement in september  and an additional million for the related amendment fee 
we also recognized million for gsk research funding and reimbursement of patent costs by gsk 
in addition  for the year ended december   under the lilly agreement  we recognized million for research funding  million for a development milestone and million of the million upfront fee 
we also recognized million of the upfront fee received under the medicis 
table of contents agreement and million for research work performed under our other research and development agreements  including our agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in our an and an program costs of million and million  respectively  partially offset by an increase in our tavaborole program of million 
due to our revised near term focus on developing an instead of an for atopic dermatitis  our activities for an were minimal in as compared to  when we were conducting and completing our phase trial in atopic dermatitis  manufacturing clinical supplies and conducting preclinical studies for this compound 
our manufacturing activities and our internal clinical efforts were more extensive for an in than they were in in  we were building up our an drug product supplies to be used in our and long term toxicology studies and clinical trials  while in our drug manufacturing activities were more limited 
for our tavaborole program  our regulatory and pre commercialization activities  which included preparations for our expected nda filing in mid  manufacturing of registration batches and start up activities with a newly selected contract manufacturing organization  were more extensive in than they were during the same period in and these increased activities were only partially offset by a decline in our clinical trial activities for tavaborole versus the prior year as our phase trials were nearing completion by the end of for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  our research and development spending also decreased by million and million for our collaborations with medicis and our other research activities  including our neglected diseases programs  respectively 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million and million in spending under our collaboration with gsk and lilly  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in compared to was primarily due to increases of million in legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate activities  million in our expenses for marketing consulting and other pre commercialization activities for tavaborole and million in salaries and related expenses due to the hiring of additional personnel 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in our stock compensation expense of million in as compared to interest income 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended compared to was due to a reduction in average investment balances and lower yields 
interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt 
interest expense increased in compared to the same period in due to the higher outstanding balance of our debt  which was only partially offset by a lower effective interest rate 
upon the early extinguishment of our lighthouse capital partners v  lp  or lighthouse  debt in march  we incurred a loss of million  which consisted of the unaccrued portion of the final payment  the unamortized portions of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs  plus a prepayment penalty 
other expense 
the increase in other expense in the year ended december  compared to the same period in was a result of the deferred financing fees relating to our debt

during  we recognized the remaining million of the upfront fee received from gsk in  of which million was recognized as a result of the material modification of our gsk arrangement in september  or the master amendment  an additional million amendment fee related to the additional rights provided to gsk under the master amendment and million for funding of our tb research activities and patent costs 
we also recognized million for research funding  million for a development milestone earned and million of the upfront fee received under the lilly agreement 
additionally  we recognized million of the upfront fee received under the medicis agreement and million for work performed under other research and development agreements  including our agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
during  we recognized million for a development milestone earned under the collaboration with gsk  million of revenue for reimbursement of patent and clinical costs related to an and million of the upfront fee received from gsk in we also recognized revenue in for the million payment that we received from merck upon the termination of the schering license agreement 
in addition  we recognized million for research funding and million of the upfront fee under the lilly agreement and million of revenue for work we performed under research and development agreements  including under agreements with not for profit organizations for neglected diseases 
government grant revenue 
during  we recognized the full million of the qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant funds awarded to us in october by the united states department of the treasury for eligible investments we made in six of our projects during and research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily due to the increases in manufacturing  development and clinical trial activities  which caused our expenses for tavaborole  an and an to increase by million  million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated our phase trials for tavaborole and completed enrollment of approximately  patients during during this period  we were also manufacturing  packaging and labeling our clinical supplies for these trials and beginning our work to develop processes to manufacture the product in commercial quantities 
in contrast  while we began manufacturing clinical supplies and planning for our phase clinical trials in 
table of contents the second half of  most of the activity in the first half of that year was administrative in nature 
as such  tavaborole expenses were significantly higher in than in for an  our activities during consisted of enrolling patients and completing both our phase b clinical trial in psoriasis  our phase trial in atopic dermatitis and phase absorption trial  initiating two safety trials and conducting preclinical studies 
this compared to fewer an related activities in  which consisted of conducting our initial phase trial for an  completing preclinical studies and initiating manufacturing activities in anticipation of starting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
our activities in for an consisted of enrolling patients in and completing our phase trial in atopic dermatitis  manufacturing clinical supplies and conducting preclinical studies  which resulted in an increase in an expenses compared to  during which our an related activities were limited 
for compared to  our research and development spending also increased by million and million under our contracts with lilly and medicis  respectively 
our collaboration with lilly was initiated in august and our collaboration with medicis commenced in february in addition  spending on our neglected diseases initiatives increased by million in compared to the increases in expenses for our tavaborole  an and an programs and for the lilly and medicis collaborations were partially offset by decreases of million and million in spending for an and our other gsk programs  respectively 
in  we were conducting the phase clinical trial for an at our own expense  whereas during gsk was solely responsible for expenditures related to an following their licensing of the compound in july in  our activities on the other gsk programs were reduced compared to due to the cessation of further development of compounds under these programs 
our efforts on our internal early stage research projects decreased by million in as compared with as we redirected our internal resources towards our collaborative efforts with medicis and lilly 
our neglected diseases program expenses for increased by million compared to as our efforts and funding on certain of these initiatives increased 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for as compared with was primarily due to the higher costs of operating as a public company 
our professional accounting and finance consulting fees  legal fees  board of directors compensation  directors and officers insurance and investor relations expenses all increased 
we also added additional staff in the latter part of  including our chief financial officer 
our noncash stock compensation expenses and consulting fees also increased for as compared to these increases were only partially offset by lower patent related legal fees as we allowed certain of our patents to lapse 
interest income 
the rise in interest income for compared to was due to the increase in our investment balances as a result of the proceeds from our ipo in november and our debt drawdown in march interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in march  we drew down million under our new loan facility with oxford finance llc  or oxford  and horizon technology finance corporation  or horizon  and used million of the proceeds to repay the remaining obligations under our loan facility with lighthouse capital partners v  lp  or lighthouse 
in december  we borrowed an additional million 
interest expense decreased for compared to due to the lower average effective interest rate on our new loan 
upon the early extinguishment of our lighthouse debt in march  we incurred a loss of million  which consisted of the unaccrued portion of the final payment  the unamortized portions of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs  plus a prepayment penalty 

table of contents other income expense 
the decrease in other income expense in compared to reflected the net reduction in the fair values of our preferred stock warrants during in connection with our ipo in november  the preferred stock warrants automatically converted to common stock warrants  the related liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital and subsequent revaluations are no longer required 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
our utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
we have determined that an ownership change  as defined by internal revenue code section  occurred in december however  the computed annual limitation is not expected to prevent us from utilizing our net operating losses prior to their expiration if we can generate sufficient taxable income to do so in the future 
we recorded a valuation allowance to offset in full the benefit related to the deferred tax assets because realization of this benefit was uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering  or ipo  in november  common stock offerings  private placements of equity securities  funding from our agreements with schering  gsk  lilly  medicis and organizations that fund neglected diseases research  government contract and grant funding and debt arrangements 
we have also earned interest on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented below in thousands year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash used provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million and million during and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities for primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for noncash items  as well as the net changes in our operating assets and liabilities  including those related to the ongoing amortization of the upfront fees received in prior years from lilly and medicis and the increase in current prepaid expenses for our clinical trials and preclinical studies 
the net cash used in operating activities in primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for noncash items  partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities  including those resulting from the amortization of the remaining balance of the upfront fee received from gsk due to the september master amendment and the increase in accrued liabilities due to our external development and clinical trial activities 
net cash from operations was also positively impacted by the receipts of the million upfront payment from medicis  the million amendment fee from gsk pursuant to the master amendment and million of research and development funding from mmv  one of our neglected diseases collaborators 

table of contents net cash used provided by investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
for  our purchases of short term investments and property and equipment exceeded the cash generated by maturities of our short term investments  while in  the cash generated by short term investment maturities was only partially offset by our purchases of new investments and property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for compared with million for the cash provided by financing activities for was primarily due to net proceeds of million and million from the sale of our common stock in october and february  respectively  and the million in notes payable proceeds from the september drawdown of the third tranche under our loan facility with oxford finance llc and horizon technology finance corporation  or oxford and horizon  which were partially offset by million in scheduled principal payments related to our loan 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the million borrowing under our loan facility with oxford and horizon  partially offset by million in regularly scheduled principal payments and the early extinguishment of our remaining obligations under our lighthouse loan facility 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately million as of december  and the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of the company common stock in january and february will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements until we file our nda for tavaborole in onychomycosis  which we expect to occur in mid if necessary  we would make appropriate adjustments to our spending plan in order to ensure sufficient capital resources to complete this filing 
while we believe that we currently have sufficient resources to fund our operations until the filing of such nda  we will need to obtain additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of tavaborole  fund our other research and development activities and meet our operating requirements through and beyond 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results  including the costs to maintain our currently planned operations  could vary materially 
our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors  including the initiation  progress  timing  costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates  including our ongoing and or planned phase and phase clinical trials for an  the success of our collaborations with gsk  lilly and medicis and the attainment of contingent event based payments and royalties  if any  under those agreements  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the terms and timing of any future collaboration  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  the outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost and timing of completion of commercial scale outsourced manufacturing activities  the cost of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval  and 
table of contents the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies 
we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or a possible license  collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to commercialization rights to tavaborole or any of our other product candidates  or a combination of the above 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms when needed  we could be required to significantly reduce operating expenses and delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our development programs  including our an trials  or our commercialization efforts for tavaborole  out license intellectual property rights to tavaborole and or our other product candidates  sell unsecured assets  or a combination of the above  and or cease our operations  which may have a material adverse effect on the company business  results of operations  financial condition and or its ability to make its scheduled debt payments on a timely basis or at all 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances as of december   the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of the company common stock in january and february and our projected spending in  our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion for the year ended december  a statement with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
however  our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
if we become unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements 
the reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors  our current lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into strategic alliances 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist primarily of obligations under lease agreements and our notes payable obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases notes payable total contractual obligations operating leases we lease a  square foot building consisting of office and laboratory space in palo alto  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced in april and will terminate in march we also lease a second building in palo alto  california  consisting of  square feet of office and laboratory space 
in october  we amended this lease to extend the term to december  in addition  we have two one year options to extend the lease through each of december  and the lease is cancelable with four months notice 

table of contents notes payable in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with oxford and horizon to provide up to million  available in three tranches 
the first million tranche was drawn on march   at which time we repaid million of the remaining obligations under our previous loan facility with lighthouse 
the second and third tranches of million each became available for drawdown upon our achieving full enrollment of the phase trials for tavaborole in december we borrowed million of the second tranche on december  and the revised third tranche of million on september  payments on the loan were interest only until april  and are now comprised of equal monthly payments of interest and principal through april  based upon current borrowings  a final payment of million will be due on april  contracts we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical research studies  research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes 
these contracts generally provide for termination on notice  and therefore we believe that our non cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements  such as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income loss 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income loss  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income loss and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income loss  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income loss or other comprehensive income loss under current accounting guidance 
we elected to adopt the two separate but consecutive statements presentation and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
an accounting standard amendment  which modified the fair value measurement guidance and expanded the disclosure requirements related to such measurements  became effective for us on january  the most significant change in the amendment was to the disclosures required for level measurements based on unobservable inputs 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of high credit quality securities  including us government instruments  commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our investment policy prohibits us from holding auction rate securities or derivative financial instruments 
to the extent that the investment portfolios of companies whose commercial paper is included in our investment portfolio may be subject to interest rate risks  which could be negatively impacted by reduced liquidity in auction rate securities or derivative financial instruments they hold  we may also be subject to these risks 
however  our investments as of december  are comprised of u 
s treasury securities and federal agency securities with a minimum rating of aaa or a with a remaining average maturity of the entire portfolio of days 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk and we are not aware of any material exposure to market risk
