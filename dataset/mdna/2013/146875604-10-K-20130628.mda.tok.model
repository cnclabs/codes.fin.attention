the bank primary lending market includes kings  new york  bronx and queens counties in new york city  and lower westchester county  new york 
although the bank branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions  the bank faces significant competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas 
management believes that this competition has become more intense as a result of increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions fulfillment of their responsibilities under the cra and more recently due to the decline in demand for loans 
carver federal market area has a high density of financial institutions  many of which have greater financial resources  name recognition and market presence  and all of which are competitors to varying degrees 
the bank competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks  savings institutions and mortgage banking companies 
the bank most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings institutions and credit unions 
competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds  corporate and government securities funds  and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
many of the bank competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products 
this  combined with competitors larger presence in the new york market  add to the challenges the bank faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near term profitability 
carver federal more than year history in its market area  its community involvement and relationships  targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking  help the bank compete with competitors that have entered its market

lending activities general 
carver federal loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage loans originated by the bank lending teams and secured by commercial real estate  multi family and one to four family residential property and construction loans 
substantially all of the bank mortgage loans are secured by properties located within the bank market area 
from time to time  the bank may purchase loans that comply with the bank underwriting standards from other financial institutions or in contiguous market geographies to achieve loan growth objectives 
under the bank regulatory orders  the bank is required to improve its level of adversely classified assets  limited from certain concentrations on non owner occupied commercial real estate cre loans and restricted from originating construction loans 
in recent years  carver federal has focused on the origination of commercial real estate loans and multi family residential loans 
these loans generally have higher yields and shorter maturities than one to four family residential properties  and include prepayment penalties that the bank collects if the loans pay in full prior to the contractual maturity 
the bank increased emphasis on portfolio management and monitoring of the commercial real estate and multi family residential mortgage loans was required given the increase of the overall level of credit risk inherent in this market segment 
the greater risk associated with commercial real estate and multi family residential loans has required the bank to increase its provisions for loan losses and could require the bank to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
carver federal continually reviews the composition of its mortgage loan portfolio and underwriting standards to manage the risk in the portfolio 
during fiscal  the bank began to deemphasize the origination of new construction loans and in fiscal ceased the origination of new construction loans  allowing the outstanding balance of the construction loan portfolio to decline 
as security for repayment  the bank obtains a first lien position on the underlying collateral  and generally obtains personal guarantees 
construction loans also generally have a term of two years or less 
construction loans involve a greater degree of risk than other loans because  among other things  the underwriting of such loans is based on an estimated value of the developed property  which can be difficult to ascertain in light of uncertainties inherent in such estimations 
in addition  construction lending entails the risk that the project may not be completed due to cost overruns  changes in market conditions  risk of execution or other factors 
the greater risk associated with construction loans has required the bank to increase its provision for loan losses  and could require the bank to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance the bank currently maintains 
to help mitigate risk  carver federal had originated construction loans principally through the community preservation corporation cpc 
these loans targeted affordable housing or rental dwelling units that tend to have lower risk profiles compared to other construction loans discussed below 
despite limiting most construction lending to cpc  the bank experienced a significant deterioration in this portfolio  principally driven by the deep recession 
during the recession  the ability of developers to sell their units was not only hampered by the direct impact of the recession  such as high unemployment  but also by the significant increase in governmental agency requirements to provide homeowner financing 
carver federal business banking unit was formed in with the acquisition of ccb  a commercial bank  to focus on loans to businesses located within the bank market area 
these loans are generally personally guaranteed by the business owners  and may be secured by the assets of the business 
the interest rate on these loans is generally an adjustable rate based on a published index  usually the prime rate 
these loans  while providing the bank a higher rate of return  also present a higher level of risk 
the greater risk associated with business loans could require the bank to increase its provision for loan losses  and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
loan portfolio composition 
total loans receivable decreased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  carver federal total loans receivable as a percentage of total assets decreased to at march  compared to at march  non residential real estate loans  which includes commercial real estate  totaled million  or of total loans receivable at march  compared to million or of total loans receivable at march   one to four family mortgage loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable at march  compared to million  or at march   multi family loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable at march  compared to million  or at march   business loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable at march  compared to million  or at march   construction loans net of committed but undisbursed funds  totaled million  or of total loans receivable  and consumer loans credit card loans  personal loans  and home improvement loans totaled million or of total loans receivable 
the following is a summary of loans receivable  net of allowance for loan losses as of in thousands march  march  march  march  march  amount amount amount amount amount gross loans receivable one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer and other total loans receivable add premium on loans less deferred fees and loan discounts allowance for loan losses total loans receivable  net includes personal loans non residential real estate lending 
non residential real estate lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office  mixed use properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial  retail and church buildings in the bank market area 
mixed use loans are secured by properties that are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as commercial real estate 
non residential real estate lending entails additional risks compared with one to four family residential and multi family lending 
for example  such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property 
in making non residential real estate loans  the bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and the bank lending experience with the borrower 
carver federal maximum loan to value ltv ratio on non residential real estate mortgage loans at origination is generally based on the latest appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio dscr at origination of at least on non residential real estate loans 
the bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants leases in the mortgaged property and personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers 
at march   non residential real estate mortgage loans totaled million  or of the total loan portfolio 
this balance reflects a year over year decrease of million  or 
beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter  as a result of the decline in asset quality and the regulatory orders  the bank ceased originating non owner occupied non residential real estate loans 
the bank  however  modified certain existing residential loans where the bank determined that modification was in the bank best interest 
commencing in the fourth fiscal quarter of  the bank  on a very limited basis  began originating non owner occupied non residential real estate loans that the board  or a committee of the board  determined were in the bank best interest and in accordance with prudent lending standards 
the bank offers adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with interest rate adjustment periods of one to five years and generally for terms of up to years and amortization schedules up to thirty years 
interest rates on arm loans currently offered by the bank are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period and generally are based upon a fixed spread above the fhlb ny corresponding regular advance rate 
from time to time  the bank may originate arm loans at an initial rate lower than the index as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period 
commercial adjustable rate mortgage loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan 
historically  carver federal has been a new york city metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches 
at march   loans to churches totaled million  or of the bank gross loan portfolio 
these loans generally have five  seven  or ten year terms with  or year amortization periods  a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a ltv ratio at origination 
the bank has also provided construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction 
there are currently church loans in the bank loan portfolio 
loans secured by real estate owned by faith based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church congregation  repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including reviewing the organization financial condition  limiting the size of such loans and establishing the quality of the collateral securing such loans 
the bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization  the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis to determine the church ability to service the proposed loan 
carver federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and or key person life insurance on the pastor 
the bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church leadership 
while asset quality in the church loan category historically has been one of the strongest asset classes  recent economic conditions have produced higher delinquencies in this portfolio 
while management believes that carver federal will remain a leading lender to churches in its market area  carver will continue to conduct disciplined underwriting and maintain focused portfolio management 
multi family real estate lending 
traditionally  carver federal originates and purchases multi family loans 
multi family property lending entails additional risks compared to one to four family residential lending 
for example  such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for multi family residential units 
carver federal multi family real estate loan portfolio decreased million in fiscal  or to million  or  of carver federal total loan portfolio at march  in making multi family real estate loans  the bank primarily considers the property ability to generate net operating income sufficient to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and the bank lending experience with the borrower 
carver federal multi family real estate product guidelines generally require that the maximum ltv at origination not exceed based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property on all such loans 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio at origination of at least on multi family real estate loans  which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment 
carver federal originates and purchases multi family real estate loans  which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a   or year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years  or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for additional periods 
the bank occasionally originates fixed rate loans with greater than five year terms 
personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers 
to help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multi family real estate loans  carver federal employs a risk rating system for its loans 
all commercial loans  including multi family real estate loans  are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
management continually monitors all commercial loans in order to update risk ratings when necessary see asset classification and allowance for loan and lease losses for additional information on asset classification and risk ratings 
in addition  to assist the bank in evaluating changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral  an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of commercial loan relationships 
on a quarterly basis i all new renewed loans greater than  ii a sampling of loans  to  and iii all criticized and classified loans  are reviewed 
in addition  on an annual basis  all loans greater than  and a sampling of loans  to  are reviewed 
summary reports documenting the loan reviews are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole 
construction lending 
the bank has historically originated or participated in construction loans for new construction and renovation of multi family buildings  residential developments  community service facilities  churches  and affordable housing programs 
the bank construction loans generally have adjustable interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards as the bank mortgage loans on existing properties 
the loans provide for disbursement in stages as construction is completed 
participation in construction loans may be at various stages of funding 
construction terms are usually from to months 
the construction loan interest is capitalized as part of the overall project cost and is funded monthly from the loan proceeds 
borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that apply to the bank permanent mortgage loan financing for the mortgaged property 
carver federal has additional criteria for construction loans including an engineer plan and periodic cost reviews on all construction budgets for loans in excess of  construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long term financing on improved and occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the mortgaged property value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could result in project delays and cost overruns 
if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be confronted  at or prior to the maturity of the loan  with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of such loan 
the ability of a developer to sell completed dwelling units will depend on  among other things  demand  pricing  availability of comparable properties and economic conditions 
during fiscal  the bank sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to experienced borrowers in the bank market areas  limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans and imposing a stricter ltv ratio requirement than that required for one to four family mortgage loans 
since fiscal  the bank has ceased new construction lending 
at march   the bank had million in construction loans outstanding  comprising of the bank gross loan portfolio 
the balance at march  reflects a million  or  decrease over fiscal  consistent with the bank cessation of construction lending 
one to four family residential lending 
historically  carver federal emphasized the origination and purchase of first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner 
to a much lesser degree  the bank has made loans to investors that are secured by non owner occupied one to four family properties 
in fiscal  the bank purchased million one to four family loans  no such loans were purchased in fiscal in october  the bank entered into an arrangement with a third party to originate and underwrite one to four family loans for the bank using fannie mae  freddie mac or fha underwriting guidelines 
carver federal offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of up to years and the loan amount cannot exceed of the one to four family loan portfolio 
approximately of the one to four family residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at march  were adjustable rate and approximately were fixed rate 
one to four family residential real estate loans increased million to million  or  of the gross loan portfolio at march  compared to march  during fiscal  the bank closed its residential one to four family lending department and elected to originate one to four residential loans through a third party private label origination operation 
loan origination volume is very low and most of the loans are sold servicing released 
the bank does not make the credit decision and therefore does not include these loans in its hmda reporting 
the bank lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on one to four family residential mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to with private mortgage insurance required on loans with ltv ratios in excess of that 
under certain special loan programs  carver federal may originate and sell loans secured by single family homes purchased by first time home buyers where the ltv ratio may be up to 
carver federal fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale 
from time to time the bank has sold such loans to fannie mae  the state of new york mortgage agency sonyma and other third parties 
loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to sonyma where the sale is made with servicing released 
carver federal uses several servicing firms to sub service mortgage loans  whether held in portfolio or sold with the servicing retained 
at march   the bank  through its sub servicers  serviced million in loans for fnma and million for other third parties 
carver federal offers one year  three year  five one year and five three year adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans are generally retained in carver federal portfolio although they may be sold in the secondary market 
they are indexed to the weekly average rate on one year  three year and five year us treasury or federal home loan bank fhlb securities  respectively  adjusted to a constant maturity usually one year  plus a margin 
the rates at which interest accrues on these loans are adjustable every one  three or five years  generally with limitations on adjustments of two percentage points per adjustment period and six percentage points over the life of a one year adjustable rate mortgage and four percentage points over the life of three year and five year adjustable rate mortgages 
the retention of adjustable rate loans in carver federal portfolio helps reduce carver federal exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates 
however  there are credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward re pricing of adjustable rate loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers 
although adjustable rate loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest earning assets to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the bank cost of funds 
adjustable rate loans increase the bank exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates  although decreases in the bank cost of funds would tend to offset this effect 
in the past  the bank originated or purchased a limited amount of subprime loans which are defined as those loans which have fico scores of or less 
at march   the bank had million in subprime loans  or  of its total loan portfolio of which million are non performing loans 
business loans 
carver federal small business lending portfolio decreased by million to million  or  of the bank gross loan portfolio in fiscal carver federal provides revolving credit and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately million to million in manufacturing  services and wholesale segments 
business loans are typically personally guaranteed by the owners  and may also be secured by additional collateral  including real estate  equipment and inventory 
included in commercial business loans are loans made to owners of new york city taxi medallions 
these loans  which totaled million at march   are secured through first liens on the taxi medallions 
consumer and other loans 
at march   the bank had thousand in consumer and other loans  or  of the bank gross loan portfolio 
at march   thousand  or  of the bank consumer loans were unsecured loans  consisting of consumer loans  other than loans secured by savings deposits  and thousand or  were secured by savings deposits 
consumer loans are not typically secured by collateral and therefore involve more risk than first mortgage loans 
collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower continuing financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by changes in employment  marital status  health and other personal financial factors 
further  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against carver federal  including claims and defenses that the borrower has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
in underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards  carver federal considers the borrower credit history  an analysis of the borrower income  expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral 
the underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral 
see asset quality non performing assets 
loan processing 
carver federal loan originations are derived from a number of sources  including referrals by realtors  builders  depositors  borrowers and mortgage brokers  as well as walk in and telephone customers 
loans are originated by the bank personnel who receive a base salary  commissions and other incentive compensation 
real estate  business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the bank lending department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in carver federal loan policy 
the underwriting and loan processing for residential one to four family loans are performed by an outsourced third party loan originator using lending standards established by the bank 
a commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multi family and non residential properties that the bank finances 
prior to loan approval  the property is inspected by a loan officer 
as part of the loan approval process  consideration is given to an independent appraisal  location  accessibility  stability of the neighborhood  environmental assessment  personal credit history and the financial capacity of the applicant s 
business loan applications are completed for all business loans 
most business loans are secured by real estate  personal guarantees  and or guarantees by the united states small business association sba or uniform commercial code ucc filings 
the loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant  collateral  cash flow and purpose and stability of the business 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant income and credit standing 
it is the bank policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the bank 
it is carver federal policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances 
borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and  when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the department of housing and urban development  obtain flood insurance 
most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis  together with each payment of principal and interest  to a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance 
written confirmation of the guarantee for sba loans and evidence of the ucc filing is also required 
loan approval 
except for real estate and business loans in excess of million and million  respectively  mortgage and business loan approval authority has been delegated by the bank board to the board asset liability and interest rate risk committee 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee has delegated to the bank management loan committee  which consists of certain members of executive management  loan approval authority for loans up to and including million for real estate loans and million for all other business loans 
real estate and business loans above million and million  respectively  must be approved by the full board 
purchased loans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans 
one to four family mortgage loans that conform to fnma  fha and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  standards and limits may be approved by the outsourced third party loan originator 
under the bank order  the bank was restricted from originating new cre loans without prior regulatory approval 
on december  the occ provided the bank board  or a committee of the board  authority to approve origination of cre loans under certain conditions  which includes a certification that the extension of credit is in the best interest of the bank 
loans to one borrower 
under the loans to one borrower limits of the occ  with certain limited exceptions  loans and extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of a savings bank 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the maximum loans to one borrower under this test is million and the bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit 
loan sales 
originations of one to four family real estate loans are generally made on properties located within the new york city metropolitan area  although carver federal occasionally funds loans secured by property in other areas 
all such loans  however  satisfy the bank underwriting criteria regardless of location 
the bank continues to offer one to four family fixed rate mortgage loans in response to consumer demand but requires that such loans satisfy applicable secondary market guidelines of fnma  sonyma or other third party purchasers to provide the opportunity for subsequent sale in the secondary market as desired to manage interest rate risk exposure 
loan originations and purchases 
loan originations  including loans originated for sale  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the bank purchased million in loans during fiscal year compared to no loans purchased in fiscal years and the following table sets forth certain information with respect to carver federal loan originations and advances  purchases and sales for the fiscal years ended march in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent loans originated one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer and others total loans originated loans purchased total loans originated and purchased loans sold net reductions additions to loan portfolio comprised of personal loans 
comprised of one to four family residential  commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans and business loans with a net book value of million repurchased from fnma and million purchased from a third party 
comprised of primarily construction and commercial real estate loans in the current period  and multifamily loans and one to four family mortgage loans in the prior periods 
loans purchased by the bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the bank originates 
the bank purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse  with certain exceptions related to the seller compliance with representations and warranties  and in accordance with the bank underwriting criteria for originations 
in addition  purchased loans have a variety of terms  including maturities  interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates  that may differ from those offered at that time by the bank 
the bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area  however  the bank may purchase loans secured by property outside its market area to meet its financial objectives 
the market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from carver federal market area and may be subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in carver federal market area 
there can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out of state markets will not deteriorate in the future  resulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas 
in an effort to reduce risks  the bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the bank underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the bank 
a review of each loan is conducted prior to purchase  and the bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring  in each buy sell agreement  a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents 
these warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan 
any misrepresentation must be cured within days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy sell agreement 
loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth information at march  regarding the amount of loans maturing in carver federal portfolio  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity 
demand loans  loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
construction loans generally have terms from to months and when coupled with the significant decline in originations over the past two years  the construction loan portfolio has a maturity of less than one year 
the table below does not include any estimate of prepayments  which significantly shorten the average life of all mortgage loans and may cause carver federal actual repayment experience to differ significantly from that shown below loan maturities in thousands yr

scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of such assets 
the average life of long term loans is substantially less than their contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give carver federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event  among other things  that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans in thousands due after march  fixed adjustable total gross loans receivable one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer total asset quality general 
one of the bank key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality 
through a variety of strategies  including  but not limited to  monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements  the bank has been proactive in addressing problem loans and non performing assets 
the underlying credit quality of the bank loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower ability to continue to make required loan payments and  in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so  the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan 
for non owner occupied non residential real estate and multi family real estate loans  the borrower ability to pay typically is dependent on rental income  which can be impacted by vacancies and general market conditions 
for one to four family loans  a borrowers ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income 
for owner occupied non residential real estate  a borrower ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on the success of the borrower business 
for all of the bank loans  a borrower ability to pay is also impacted by general economic and other factors  such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets 
collateral values  particularly real estate values  are also impacted by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  demographics  maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  loans held for sale  and property acquired in settlement of loans  including foreclosure 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan  the bank and or its loan servicers take prompt steps to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
this includes a series of actions such as phone calls  letters  customer visits and  if necessary  legal action 
in the event the loan has a guarantee  the bank may seek to recover on the guarantee  including  where applicable  from the small business administration sba 
loans that remain delinquent are reviewed for reserve provisions and charge off 
the bank collection efforts continue after the loan is charged off  except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not productive 
the bank may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower loan 
in cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty  the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
loans modified in a tdr are placed on non accrual status until the bank determines that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for a minimum of six months 
at march   loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring totaled million  of which million were classified as performing 
the following table sets forth information with respect to carver federal non performing assets  which includes non accrual loans  loans held for sale  and property acquired in settlement of loans as of march in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis gross loans receivable one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer total non accrual loans other non performing assets real estate owned loans held for sale total other non performing assets total non performing assets accruing loans contractually past due days non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets non accrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds days past due and in the opinion of management  the collection of contractual interest and or principal is doubtful 
payments received on a non accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on assessment of the ability to collect on the loan 
other non performing assets generally represent loans that the bank is in the process of selling and has designated held for sale or property acquired by the bank in settlement of loans less costs to sell ie  through foreclosure  repossession or as an in substance foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their cost or fair value 
troubled debt restructured loans performing in accordance with their modified terms for less than six months and those not performing in accordance with their modified terms are considered non accrual and are included in the non accrual category in the table above 
tdr loans that have performed in accordance with their modified terms for a period of at least six months are generally considered performing loans and are not presented in the table above 
loans days or more past due and still accruing  which were not included in the non performing category 
at march   total non performing assets decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million at march  non accrual loans consist of one to four family loans  commercial real estate loans  multi family loan  construction loan  consumer loans and small business and sba loans 
the decrease in delinquent loans from the prior year is primarily the result of stabilized  if not slightly improved  economic conditions and carver proactive approach to addressing and managing delinquencies 
management believes that there may be losses associated with certain delinquent loans in the future  but also notes that the amount of losses will be reduced by values of properties securing these delinquent loans and the bank loan loss reserves 
other non performing assets of million at year end include a portfolio of loans held for sale and real estate owned assets consisting of nine properties foreclosed upon  a decrease of million from year end although we believe that substantially all risk elements at march  have been disclosed  it is possible that for a variety of reasons  including economic conditions  certain borrowers may be unable to comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real estate and commercial loans 
asset classification and allowances for losses 
federal regulations and the bank policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is non performing and or determined to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged  if any 
an asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable 
an asset is classified as loss if it is considered uncollectible  even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future 
the regulations also provide for a special mention designation  described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful result in a higher level of allowances for loan losses recorded in accordance with accounting standards codification asc subtopic loss contingencies 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss  a savings institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses pursuant to loan impairment guidance in asc subtopic in the amount of the portion of the asset classified as a loss or charge off such amount 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution classifications 
if a savings institution does not agree with an examiner classification of an asset  it may appeal this determination to the occ regional director 
the occ  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses alll 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis  but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management prompt attention  such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution as to the appropriate level of the institution allowance for loan losses 
while management believes carver federal has established its existing loss allowances in accordance with the alll policy  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing carver federal assets  will not require carver federal to increase its loss allowance  thereby negatively affecting carver federal reported financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information regarding carver federal alll policy  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
the board has designated the internal asset review committee of management to perform a review on a quarterly basis of the bank asset quality  establish general and specific allowances  determine loan classifications and submit their report to the board for review 
carver federal methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur 
further  management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations  or if circumstances pertaining to individual loans change  or new information pertaining to individual loans or the loan portfolio is identified 
the bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers  each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committees of the board establish policy relating to internal classification of loans and also provides input to the internal asset review committee in its review of classified assets 
in originating loans  carver federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
it is management policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality  character and size  the bank and the industry historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions and certain qualitative factors 
in addition  considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate market 
see lending activities loan purchases and originations 
carver federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses against the bank income 
general allowances are established by management on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the bank loans  taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency trends  current charge off and loss experience  the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally 
specific allowances are provided for individual loans  or portions of loans  when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan 
a loan is deemed impaired when it is probable the bank will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans the bank individually classifies as impaired include multi family mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans and business loans which have been classified by the bank credit review officer as substandard  doubtful or loss for which it is probable that principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the loan contractual terms  and certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring a valuation allowance for collateral dependent loans is established when the current estimated fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan  if any  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
a valuation allowance for cash flow dependent loans is established when based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  impairment is demonstrated 
at the date of foreclosure or other repossession  the bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
carver federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure 
subsequent to taking possession of the property  management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell  declines 
if  upon ultimate disposition of the property  net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property  a gain on sale of real estate is recorded  providing the bank did not provide financing for the sale 
the following table sets forth an analysis of carver federal allowance for loan losses for the years ended march in thousands balance at beginning of year less charge offs one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer and other total charge offs add recoveries one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer and other total recoveries net loans charged off provision for losses balance at end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding allowance to total loans allowance to non performing loans the following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by asset category at march in thousands amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans amount of loans to total gross loans allowance for loan losses one to four family multi family commercial real estate construction business consumer and other unallocated total allowance the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
investment activities general 
the bank utilizes mortgage backed and other investment securities in its asset liability management strategy 
in making investment decisions  the bank considers  among other things  its yield and interest rate objectives  its interest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow 
generally  the investment policy of the bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the bank asset liability management policies  investment quality  loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements  liquidity needs and performance objectives 
securities are classified into one of three categories trading  held to maturity  and available for sale 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included  on an after tax basis  in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at march   the bank had no securities classified as trading 
at march   million  or of the bank mortgage backed and other investment securities  were classified as available for sale 
the remaining million  or  were classified as held to maturity 
mortgage backed securities 
the bank has invested in mortgage backed securities to help achieve its asset liability management goals and collateral needs 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than whole loans  they present substantially lower credit risk  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the bank 
because carver federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage backed securities  these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities  which generally only pay principal at maturity 
mortgage backed securities also help the bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation qualified thrift lender test and federal and state taxation 
at march   mortgage backed securities constituted of total assets  as compared to of total assets at march  carver federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed securities in the form of government national mortgage association gnma pass through certificates  federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corp fhlmc participation certificates and commercial mortgage backed securities 
gnma pass through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the united states government while fnma and fhlmc certificates are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest 
mortgage backed securities generally entitle carver federal to receive a pro rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages 
the cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity 
carver federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the small business administration sba 
the bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  which at march   constituted million  or  of the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  however  expose carver federal to certain unique risks 
in a declining rate environment  accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose carver federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds 
in the event the mortgage backed security has been funded with an interest bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage backed security  the bank interest rate spread could be adversely affected 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment on the underlying mortgages  effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage backed security and exposing the bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest 
for additional information regarding carver federal mortgage backed securities portfolio and its maturities refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  securities 
other investment securities 
in addition to mortgage backed securities  the bank also invests in high quality assets such as government and agency obligations  corporate bonds and mutual funds 
carver federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments  including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments  deposits at the fhlb ny  certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds 
the bank may also invest  subject to certain limitations  in commercial paper having one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency  and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other earning assets 
federal regulations require the bank to maintain an investment in fhlb ny stock and a sufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities 
for additional information  see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation liquidity 
securities impairment 
the bank s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in the bank portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
on a quarterly basis  the bank reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
following fasb guidance  the amount of an other than temporary impairment  when there are credit and non credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell  and for which it is more likely than not that the bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non credit impairment  the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings  and the remaining difference between the debt security s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive loss 
this guidance also requires additional disclosures about investments in an unrealized loss position and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other than temporary impairment 
as of fiscal year end and  the bank does not have any securities that may be classified as having other than temporary impairment in its investment portfolio 
sources of funds general 
deposits are the primary source of carver federal funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  carver federal derives funds from loan principal repayments  loan and investment interest payments  maturing investments and fee income 
loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits  competition and general economic conditions 
borrowed money may be used to supplement the bank available funds  and from time to time the bank borrows funds from the fhlb ny and has borrowed funds through trust preferred debt securities 
deposits 
carver federal attracts deposits from consumers  businesses  non profit organizations and public entities through its ten branches principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments  including passbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit  which range in term from days to five years 
deposit terms vary  principally on the basis of the minimum balance required  the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
carver federal also offers individual retirement accounts 
carver federal policies are designed primarily to attract deposits from local residents and businesses through the bank branches 
carver federal also holds deposits from various governmental agencies or authorities and corporations 
as of march  the bank also has million of reciprocal deposits acquired through its participation in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
the cdars network arranges for placement of carver federal customer funds into certificate of deposit accounts issued by other cdars member banks 
the certificate of deposit accounts are in increments of less than the individual fdic insurance limit amount  to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full fdic deposit insurance 
this allows the bank to maintain its customer relationship while still providing its customers with fdic insurance for the full amount of their deposits  up to million per customer 
in exchange  carver federal receives from other member banks their customers deposits in like amounts 
depositors are allowed to withdraw funds early with a penalty  from these accounts 
carver federal may elect to participate in the program by making or receiving deposits without making or receiving a reciprocal deposit 
prior to the emergency economic stabilization act of essa  the fdic deposit insurance limit was  as result of essa  this limit was increased to  through december  on july   president barack obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act into law  which  in part  permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  in february  cease and desist orders issued to carver federal restricted its ability to add new cdars deposit accounts and renew existing cdars deposit accounts 
carver federal applied for a brokered deposit waiver through the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to allow for the renewal of the existing cdars deposit base 
in april the fdic approved carver federal brokered deposit waiver  allowing for the renewal of the bank existing cdars deposit base 
the bank has submitted quarterly waivers throughout fiscal year and received approval on all requests 
deposit interest rates  maturities  service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposits are established based on the bank funds acquisition and liquidity requirements  the rates paid by the bank competitors  current market rates  the bank growth goals and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements

borrowed funds 
while deposits are the primary source of funds for carver federal lending  investment and general operating activities  carver federal is authorized to use advances from the fhlb ny and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos from approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
the fhlb ny functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb system  carver federal is required to own stock in the fhlb ny and is authorized to apply for advances 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
advances from the fhlb ny are secured by carver federal stock in the fhlb ny and a pledge of carver federal mortgage loan and mortgage backed and agency securities portfolios 
the bank takes into consideration the term of borrowed money with the re pricing cycle of the mortgage loans on the balance sheet 
at march   carver had million in fhlb ny advances outstanding 
during fiscal year the fhlb ny increased the collateral requirements on carver existing advances 
fhlb ny could institute additional collateral requirements or restrict carver ability to access additional advances or renew maturing advances 
during fiscal year  the bank terminated million in repo borrowings as well as prepaid a million fixed rate fhlb advance 
these prepayments resulted in charges of thousand 
on september   carver statutory trust i issued  shares  liquidation amount  per share  of floating rate capital securities 
gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities were million and  together with the proceeds from the sale of the trust common securities  were used to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of the company floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due the trust preferred debt securities are redeemable quarterly at the option of the company and have a mandatory redemption date of september  cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum reset quarterly equal to over month libor  with a rate at march  of

the consumer financial protection bureau will assume responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations  a function currently assigned to prudential regulators  and will have authority to impose new requirements 
however  institutions of less than billion in assets  such as carver federal savings bank  fsb  will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by  and be subject to the primary enforcement authority of  their prudential regulator rather than the consumer financial protection bureau 
in addition to eliminating the office of thrift supervision and creating the consumer financial protection bureau  the dodd frank act  among other things  requires changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance  mandates the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies  requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans  directs the federal reserve board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees  reduces the federal preemption afforded to federal savings associations and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act contain delayed effective dates and or require the issuance of regulations 
as a result  it will be some time before their impact on operations can be assessed by management 
however  there is a significant possibility that the dodd frank act will  at a minimum  result in an increased regulatory burden and higher compliance  operating  and possibly  interest costs for the bank and the company 
capital and liquidity prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the occ is authorized and  in some cases  required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank regulatory capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
generally  a capital restoration plan must be filed with the occ within days of the date a bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution  including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion 
under occ regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the occ to meet a specific capital level 
in assessing an institution capital adequacy  the occ takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions as they deem necessary 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  or fdicia  required that the occ and other federal banking agencies revise their risk based capital standards  with appropriate transition rules  to ensure that they take into account irr concentration of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
the occ regulations do not include a specific irr component of the risk based capital requirement 
however  the occ monitors the irr of individual institutions through a variety of means  including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value  npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity assets and liabilities and  therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution net worth 
the occ has also used this npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
in addition  occ bulletin provides guidance on the management of irr and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the occ  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the occ regarding npv analysis 
as discussed below  the occ has imposed such requirements on carver federal 
carver federal capital position 
carver federal  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed minimum requirements and that are consistent with carver federal risk profile 
the previously described cease and desist order carver federal entered into with the occ includes a capital directive requiring the bank to achieve and maintain regulatory capital levels of a tier i core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by april  at march   carver federal did not achieve these capital requirements with a tangible capital ratio of  total risk based capital ratio of and a leverage capital ratio of 
the company did not raise the additional capital by april  and thus filed a contingency plan with the occ 
on june  the company raised million of equity 
the increase in the company and bank capital position resulted in the company and the bank meeting the capital directives within the orders 
at march   carver federal exceeded the capital directives required by the cease and desist order  with a tier i capital ratio of total risk based capital ratio of and a tier i risk based capital ratio of 
the occ has determined that carver federal is adequately capitalized 
the company revised its capital plan based upon occ bulletin issued june   which has been presented to and is under review from the occ 
on june   the occ and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules that would revise their leverage and risk based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the basel committee on banking supervision and certain provisions of the dodd frank act 
the proposed rules would apply to all depository institutions and top tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more 
among other things  the proposed rules would establish a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement of risk weighted assets and a higher minimum tier capital to risk based assets requirement of risk weighted assets and assign higher risk weight to exposures that are more than days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition  development or construction of real property 
the prompt corrective action categories described previously would be adjusted accordingly 
the proposed rules would also require unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements 
the proposed rules would limit a banking organization capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of a specified amount of common equity tier capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements 
the proposed rules indicated that the final rules would become effective on january   and the changes set forth in the final rules would be phased in from january  through january  however  the agencies subsequently indicated that  due to the volume of public comments received  implementation of the final rule has been delayed past january  and no final rule has yet been issued 
limitation on capital distributions 
these are various restrictions on a bank ability to make capital distributions  including cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital 
in addition  a savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  must file a notice with the frb at least days before making a capital distribution 
the bank must also file an application for prior approval with the occ if the total amount of its capital distributions including each proposed distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed the bank net income for that year plus the bank retained net income for the previous two years 
the bank may not pay dividends to the company if  after paying those dividends  the bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the occ notified the bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision 
the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
as was previously noted  the orders presently require prior regulatory approval of any bank dividend or other capital distribution 
liquidity 
the bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs 
in the normal course of business  the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating  investing and financing activities 
cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less are the bank most liquid assets 
the bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations 
standards for safety and soundness standards for safety and soundness 
the occ has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
in addition  occ regulations authorize the occ to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the occ must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the occ may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
enforcement 
the occ has primary enforcement responsibility over the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
tarp the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  was signed into law on october  and authorizes the us department of the treasury treasury to establish the troubled asset relief program tarp to purchase certain troubled assets from financial institutions  including banks and thrifts 
under the tarp  the treasury may purchase residential and commercial mortgages  and securities  obligations or other instruments based on such mortgages  originated or issued on or before march  that the secretary of the treasury determines promotes market stability  as well as any other financial instrument that the treasury  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or frb  determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote market stability 
in the case of a publicly traded financial institution that sells troubled assets into the tarp  the treasury must receive a warrant giving the treasury the right to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution  or voting stock with respect to which the treasury agrees not to exercise voting power  subject to certain de minimis exceptions 
in addition  all financial institutions that sell troubled assets to the tarp and meet certain conditions will also be subject to certain executive compensation restrictions  which differ depending on how the troubled assets are acquired under the tarp 
on october   the treasury announced that it would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp cpp  the treasury made billion of capital available from the billion authorized by the eesa to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions are required to adopt the treasury standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp cpp 
on january   the company announced that it completed the sale of million in preferred stock to the treasury in connection with carver participation in the tarp cpp 
importantly  carver is exempt from the requirement to issue a warrant to the treasury to purchase shares of common stock  as the bank is a certified community development financial institution cdfi  conducting most of its depository and lending activities in disadvantaged communities 
therefore  the investment did not dilute common stockholders 
as a participant in tarp cpp  the company was subject to certain obligations currently in effect  such as compensation restrictions  a luxury expenditure policy  the requirement the company include a say on pay proposal in the proxy statement and certain certifications 
the company was also subject to additional restrictions or obligations as may be imposed under tarp cpp for as long as the company participates in tarp cpp 
the treasury announced in february the implementation of the community development capital initiative cdci 
this new capital program invested lower cost capital in cdfis that lend to small businesses in the country most economically depressed communities 
cdfi banks and thrifts are eligible to receive investments of capital with an initial dividend rate of percent  compared to the percent rate offered under the cpp 
cdfis may apply to receive capital up to percent of risk weighted assets 
to encourage repayment while recognizing the unique circumstances facing cdfis  the dividend rate will increase to percent after eight years  compared to five years under cpp 
on august   carver completed the exchange of the million of cpp funds for an equivalent amount of cdci funds 
as previously described  the cease and desist order prohibits the company from paying dividends without prior occ approval  and as such  has suspended the regularly quarterly cash dividend payment on the company fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued under the cdci program 
as stated above  on october  the us treasury exchanged the cdci series b preferred stock for  shares of company common stock 
other supervision and regulation activity powers 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act hola  as amended  and federal regulations 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
the bank authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  a limit of of an association capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  a limit of of an association assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  a limit of of an association assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  a limit of of assets on non conforming loans loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and a limit of the greater of of assets or an association capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property 
on october   the occ and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender should be able to readily document income and a lender may accept a borrower statement as to the borrower income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity 
on december   the ots published guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices  or the cre guidance  to address concentrations of commercial real estate loans in savings associations 
the cre guidance reinforces and enhances the occ existing regulations and guidelines for real estate lending and loan portfolio management  but does not establish specific commercial real estate lending limits 
the bank has evaluated the cre guidance to determine its compliance and  as necessary  modified its risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards 
see lending activities and asset quality in item  business for discussions of carver federal loan product offerings and related underwriting standards 
on june   the occ and other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final statement on subprime mortgage lending  or the statement  to address the growing concerns facing the subprime mortgage market  particularly with respect to rapidly rising subprime default rates that may indicate borrowers do not have the ability to repay adjustable rate subprime loans originated by financial institutions 
in particular  the agencies expressed concern in the statement that current underwriting practices do not take into account that many subprime borrowers are not prepared for payment shock and that the current subprime lending practices compound risk for financial institutions 
the statement describes the prudent safety and soundness and consumer protection standards that financial institutions should follow to ensure borrowers obtain loans that they can afford to repay 
these standards include a fully indexed  fully amortized qualification for borrowers and cautions on risk layering features  including an expectation that stated income and reduced documentation should be accepted only if there are documented mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for verification of a borrower repayment capacity 
consumer protection standards include clear and balanced product disclosures to customers and limits on prepayment penalties that allow for a reasonable period of time  typically at least days  for borrowers to refinance prior to the expiration of the initial fixed interest rate period without penalty 
the statement also reinforces the april  interagency statement on working with mortgage borrowers  in which the federal bank regulatory agencies encouraged institutions to work constructively with residential borrowers who are financially unable or reasonably expected to be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations on their home loans 
in addition  the statement referenced expanded guidance issued by the agencies by press release dated january  according to the expanded guidance  subprime loans are loans to borrowers which display one or more characteristics of reduced payment capacity 
five specific criteria  which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers and may not match all markets or institutions specific subprime definitions  are set forth  including having a fico credit score of or below at the time of origination 
within the bank loan portfolio  there are loans to borrowers who had fico scores of or below at the time of origination 
however  as a portfolio lender  the bank reviews all data contained in borrower credit reports and does not base underwriting decisions solely on fico scores 
the bank believes the aforementioned loans  when made  were amply collateralized and otherwise conformed to the bank prime lending standards 
these loans are not a material component of the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio 
carver federal has evaluated the guidance  the cre guidance and the statement to determine compliance and  as necessary  modified risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards

loans to one borrower limitations 
the bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as a national bank 
with specified exceptions  the bank total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed of the bank unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income 
the bank may lend additional amounts up to of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
the bank currently complies with applicable loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the bank limit on loans to one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was million 
qualified thrift lender test 
under hola  the bank must comply with a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under this test  the bank is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association total assets less the sum of a specified liquid assets up to of total assets  b goodwill and other intangible assets and c the value of property used to conduct the bank business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities and consumer loans 
if the bank fails the qtl test  it must operate under certain restrictions on its activities 
the dodd frank act made non compliance potentially subject to agency enforcement action for violation of law 
at march   the bank maintained approximately of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank had also met the qtl test in each of the prior months and was  therefore  a qualified thrift lender 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  federal law permits the bank to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority for the bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the bank activities 
this authority under federal law and regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under cra  as amended  as implemented by occ regulations  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the bank nor does it limit the bank discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
cra does  however  require the occ  in connection with its examination of the bank  to assess the bank record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank 
in particular  the system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution record of making loans in its assessment areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution delivery of banking services through its branches  atm centers and other offices 
cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination conducted in regulations require that carver federal publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of cra 
the company has no such agreements in place at this time 
transactions with related parties 
the bank authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates and insiders is limited by occ regulations and by sections a  b  g and h of the federal reserve act fra 
in general  these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the bank as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
additionally  certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the bank capital 
collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates to receive loans from the bank 
in addition  occ regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
in january  certain directors and seniors officers of the company loaned a total of  to the company to allow the company to make the interest payment on the company trust preferred securities due in january the loan is secured by a pledge of shares of treasury stock 
the interest rate on the loan is prime plus 
the loan was repaid upon completion of the company capital raise 
the bank authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the federal reserve board 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank board 
at march   there were no loans to officers or directors 
section of the sarbanes oxley act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in the sarbanes oxley act 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
assessment 
the occ charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates 
these assessments are based on three components the size of the association  on which the basic assessment is based  the association supervisory condition  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of   or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association operations  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced for others loans aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
for fiscal  carver paid million in regulatory assessments 
insurance of deposit accounts the fdic merged the savings association insurance fund and the bank insurance fund to create the depositors insurance fund dif on march  the bank is a member of the dif and pays its deposit insurance assessments to the dif 
effective january   the fdic established a new risk based assessment system for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by insured depository institutions 
under this assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of four risk categories  with the first category having two sub categories  based on the institution most recent supervisory ratings and capital ratios 
base assessment rates ranged from two to four basis points of insured deposits for risk category i institutions and were seven basis points for risk category ii institutions  twenty five basis points for risk category iii institutions and forty basis points for risk category iv institutions 
base assessment rates were then subject to adjustment based on certain risk factors specified by the fdic 
for institutions within risk category i  assessment rates generally depended upon a combination of camels capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity  sensitivity to market risk component ratings and financial ratios  or for large institutions with long term debt issuer ratings  assessment rates depend on a combination of long term debt issuer ratings and camels component ratings 
the fdic has the flexibility to adjust rates  without further notice and comment rulemaking  provided that no such adjustment can be greater than three basis points from one quarter to the next  that adjustments cannot result in rates more than three basis points above or below the base rates  and that rates cannot be negative 
the dodd frank act required the federal deposit insurance corporation to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation finalized a rule that implemented that change april  among other things  the final rule changed the assessment range inclusive of potential adjustments to basis points to basis points 
the bank expense for fdic insurance payments totaled million in fiscal year the fdic has authority to further increase insurance assessments and therefore management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
a significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
anti money laundering and customer identification the bank is subject to occ regulations implementing the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
by way of amendments to the bank secrecy act  title iii of the usa patriot act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies 
further  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including banks  thrifts  brokers  dealers  credit unions  money transfer agents and parties registered under the united states commodity exchange act of  as amended 
title iii of the usa patriot act and the related occ regulations impose the following requirements with respect to financial institutions performance of a risk assessment and establishment of a board approved policy designation of a qualified bsa officer establishment of an effective training program establishment of anti money laundering programs establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts  including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time establishment of enhanced due diligence policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks in addition  bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on certain corporate applications 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which is one of the twelve regional banks composing the fhlb system 
each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
the bank  as a fhlb ny member  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  and ii or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb ny of its outstanding advances from the fhlb ny 
the bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the fhlb ny at march  of million 
any advances from the fhlb ny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and all long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
fhlb ny is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the fhlb ny can pay as dividends to its members and could also result in the fhlb ny imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb ny advances increased  the bank net interest income would be adversely affected 
dividends from fhlb ny to the bank amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the dividend rate paid on fhlb ny stock at march  was 
under the gramm leach bliley act  as amended glb  which  among other things  repealed historical restrictions and eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers  membership in the fhlb system is now voluntary for all federally chartered savings banks such as the bank 
glb also replaced the existing redeemable stock structure of the fhlb system with a capital structure that required each fhlb to meet a leverage limit and a risk based permanent capital requirement 
two classes of stock are authorized class a redeemable on six months notice and class b redeemable on five years notice 
pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal housing finance board  as required by glb  the fhlb has adopted a capital plan that changed the foregoing minimum stock ownership requirements for fhlb stock 
under the new capital plan  each member of the fhlb has to maintain a minimum investment in fhlb capital stock in an amount equal to the sum of  the greater of  or of the member mortgage related assets  and of the dollar amount of any outstanding advances under such member advances  collateral pledge and security agreement with the fhlb ny 
federal reserve system federal reserve board regulations require federally chartered savings associations to maintain non interest earning cash reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and demand deposit accounts 
a reserve of is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between million and million subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board plus a reserve of subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board between and against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board is exempt from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
since required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank or a pass through account as defined by the federal reserve board  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce carver federal interest earning assets 
fhlb system members are also authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  but federal reserve board regulations require institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from a federal reserve bank 
privacy protection carver federal is subject to occ regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of glb 
these regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
the regulations also require the bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices 
in addition  to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having the bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information  subject to certain exceptions 
the bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information 
these regulations implement certain provisions of glb 
the guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  which would include administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines 
holding company regulation the company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the federal reserve board 
as such  the company is registered with and is subject to federal reserve board examination and supervision  as well as certain reporting requirements 
in addition  the federal reserve board has enforcement authority over the company and its subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the occ to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution 
the dodd frank act transferred the responsibility for that regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies to the federal reserve board effective july  glb restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies 
unitary savings and loan holding companies that are grandfathered  ie  unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the regulator on or before may   such as the company  retain their authority under the prior law 
all other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for financial holding companies and certain other activities specified by frb regulations 
glb also prohibits non financial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies 
restrictions applicable to all savings and loan holding companies 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including the company  directly or indirectly  from acquiring control as defined under hola of another savings institution or a holding company parent without prior frb approval  through merger  consolidation  or purchase of assets  another savings institution or a holding company thereof  or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution or a holding company  without prior occ approval  or control of any depository institution not insured by the fdic except through a merger with and into the holding company savings institution subsidiary that is approved by the frb 
a savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located  except in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the fdic  if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of march   or if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations  the frb must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements 
the dodd frank act  however  requires the federal reserve board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent  both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital  than those applicable to institutions themselves 
instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as tier capital  as is currently the case with bank holding companies 
instruments issued by may  will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of billion or less 
the proposed rules to implement these requirements were issued in june  and have not yet been finalized 
the dodd frank act also extends the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies 
the regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital  liquidity and other support in times of financial stress 
federal securities laws the company is subject to the periodic reporting  proxy solicitation  tender offer  insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act 
delaware corporation law the company is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
thus  it is subject to regulation by the state of delaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the general corporation law of the state of delaware 
federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
the company and the bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns  report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending march st  using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including in particular the bank tax reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the bank or the company 
bad debt reserves 
prior to fiscal  the bank met the requirement as a small bank one with assets having an adjusted tax basis of million or less and was permitted to maintain a reserve for bad debts  and to make  within specified formula limits  annual additions to the reserve which are deductible for purposes of computing the bank taxable income 
since fiscal year  the bank has not been considered to be a small bank because its total assets have exceeded million 
see income taxes note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
distributions 
to the extent that the bank makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the bank base year reserve  ie  its reserve as of march   to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans  and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the bank taxable income 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of the bank current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in the bank taxable income 
the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
dividends received deduction and other matters 
the company may exclude from its income of dividends received from the bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is generally in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the company and the bank will not file a consolidated tax return  except that if the company or the bank owns more than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend  then of any dividends received may be deducted 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the bank and the company file on a combined basis and are subject to new york state franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the highest tax 
entire net income means federal taxable income with adjustments 
if  however  the application of an alternative tax based on taxable assets allocated to new york  alternative entire net income or a fixed minimum fee results in a greater tax  an alternative tax will be imposed 
the company was subject to tax based upon assets for new york state for fiscal in addition  new york state imposes a tax surcharge of of the new york state franchise tax allocable to business activities carried on in the metropolitan commuter transportation district 
for fiscal  the new york state franchise tax rate computed on taxable assets was including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge 
new york state has enacted legislation that enabled the bank to avoid the recapture of the new york state tax bad debt reserves that otherwise would have occurred as a result of the changes in federal law and to continue to utilize either the federal method or a method based on a percentage of its taxable income for computing additions to its bad debt reserve 
new york city 
the bank and the company file on a combined basis and are also subject to a similarly calculated new york city banking corporation tax on assets allocated to new york city 
for fiscal  the new york city banking corporation tax rate computed on taxable assets is 
delaware taxation 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the company is exempted from delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware

item a 
risk factors 
the following is a summary of risk factors relevant to the company operations which should be carefully reviewed 
these risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance 
carver prospective regulatory capital requirements remain uncertain and there is a risk that the company will be unable to meet these new standards in the time frame expected by the market or regulators 
the proposed final us rule implementing basel iii and the capital related provisions of the dodd frank act establishes tougher capital standards through higher capital ratio requirements  more restrictive capital definitions  higher risk weighting of certain assets and additional capital buffers 
if the final rule is enacted as proposed  basel iii will fundamentally impact the bank profitability  ability to pay dividends and liquidity requirements 
the proposed rule may also require process and system changes  including for stress testing and capital management infrastructure 
the proposed final rule for basel iii is currently in the comment period and management is unable to determine what the final requirements will be or the impact it will have on the bank 
carver results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchases from us government sponsored entities gse 
in connection with the sale of loans  carver as the loan originator is required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding the originator and the loans that are being sold 
if a loan does not comply with the representations and warranties  carver may be obligated to repurchase the loans  and in so doing  incur any loss directly 
prior to december  the bank originated and sold loans to fnma 
during fiscal years and  the bank has been obligated to repurchase loans previously sold to fnma 
there is no assurance that the bank will not be required to repurchase additional loans in the future 
accordingly  any repurchase obligations to fnma could materially and adversely affects the bank results of operations and earnings in the future 
the prolonged negative effect of the recession and weak economic recovery will continue to adversely affect our financial performance 
the severe recession and weak economic recovery has resulted in continued uncertainty in the financial and credit markets in general 
there is also continued concern about the possibility of another economic downturn 
the federal reserve  in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy  has  among other things  kept interest rates historically low through its targeted federal funds rate and purchased mortgage backed securities 
while this has helped prevent the economy from sinking further and reduced the bank cost of funds  the low rates have made it difficult for the bank to earn interest income on investments and loans 
if the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise which may negatively impact the housing markets  business ability to borrow and the us economic recovery 
regardless of the cause or the federal reserve response  a prolonged weakness in the economy generally  and in the financial services industry in particular  could continue to negatively affect our operations in multiple ways  including the ability to originate new loans at reasonable rates and the continued deterioration of our loan portfolio  requiring increased provisions and costs to mange problem assets 
carver results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area 
at march   a significant majority of the bank lending portfolio was concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of this geographic concentration  carver results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area 
further decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to our borrowers 
adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the bank control may also continue to have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments  which would have an adverse impact on earnings 
consequently  deterioration in economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank loan portfolio  which could result in increased delinquencies  decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses 
such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and services  and  accordingly  further negatively affect results of operations 
the bank is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  both nationally and locally 
financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the ongoing economic recession  including job losses  could have an adverse effect on the bank borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect the bank financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans 
however  no assurance can be given that the original appraised values are reflective of current market conditions as the bank has experienced material declines in real estate values in all markets in which it lends 
further  significant increases in job losses and unemployment will have a negative impact on the financial condition of residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans 
a continuation or further deterioration in national and local economic conditions  including an accelerating pace of job losses  particularly in the new york metropolitan area  could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank loan portfolio  which could result in further increases in loan delinquencies  causing a decrease in the bank interest income as well as an adverse impact on the bank loan loss experience  causing an increase in the bank allowance for loan losses and related provision and a decrease in net income 
such deterioration could also adversely impact the demand for the bank products and services  and  accordingly  the bank results of operations 
no assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in the bank interest income or an adverse impact on loan losses 
our business may be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets  the real estate market and economic conditions generally 
beginning in the latter half of and continuing into  negative developments in the capital markets resulted in uncertainty and instability in the financial markets  and an economic downturn 
the housing market declined  resulting in decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures 
the credit performance of residential and commercial real estate  construction and land loans resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
the declines in the performance and value of mortgage assets encompassed all mortgage and real estate asset types  leveraged bank loans and nearly all other asset classes  including equity securities 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital or to merge with larger and stronger institutions 
some financial institutions have failed 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness could affect our ability to sell investment securities and other financial assets  which in turn could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position 
this instability also could affect the prices at which we could make any such sales  which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by some financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
this tightening of credit has led to increased loan delinquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and a widespread reduction in general business activity 
competition among depository institutions for deposits has increased significantly  and access to deposits or borrowed funds has decreased for many institutions 
it has also become more difficult to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
current conditions  including high unemployment  soft real estate markets  and the decline of home sales and property values  could negatively affect the volume of loan originations and prepayments  the value of the real estate securing our mortgage loans  and borrowers ability to repay loan obligations  all of which could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced  and local governments and many companies are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
a worsening of current conditions would likely adversely affect our business and results of operations  as well as those of our customers 
as a result  we may experience increased foreclosures  delinquencies and customer bankruptcies  as well as more restricted access to funds 
the soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover carver actual loan losses 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income 
in addition  the occ periodically reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
a material increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by the regulatory authorities would have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
carver concentration in multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans could  in a deteriorating economic climate  expose the company to increased lending risks and related loan losses 
although carver federal has reduced its concentration in non owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to within board approved policy limits  carver federal continues to maintain a high concentration in this product area and has begun  on a select basis  to renew existing loans and make new loans 
however  further deterioration in the economy could expose carver federal to additional losses in these loan types 
changes in interest rate environment may negatively affect carver federal net income  mortgage loan originations and valuation of available for sale securities 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and  to a lesser extent  securities and the interest expense produced by our interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings 
the cost of our deposits and short term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short term interest rates  the level of which is driven by the federal open market committee of the federal reserve board 
however  the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediate term ie  five year interest rates  which are set by the market and generally vary from day to day 
the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates  and the pace at which such movements occur 
if the interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets  the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it  a reduction in our earnings 
our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interest earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits  the fair values of our securities and other financial assets  the fair values of our liabilities  and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios 
changes in interest rates could also have an effect on loan refinancing activity which  in turn  would impact the amount of prepayment penalty income we receive on our multi family and commercial real estate loans 
because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income  the extent to which they increase or decrease during any given period could have a significant impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time 
in addition  changes in interest rates could have an effect on the slope of the yield curve 
if the yield curve were to invert or become flat  our net interest income and net interest margin could contract  adversely affecting our net income and cash flows and the value of our assets 
in addition  the actual amount of time before mortgage and business loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and prevailing market interest rates impacting not only carver federal interest income  but carver federal liquidity 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the ability to assume the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related loan refinancing opportunities and competition 
finally  the estimated fair value of the company available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease materially depending on changes in interest rates 
carver federal securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate securities 
strong competition within the bank market areas could adversely affect profits and slow growth 
the new york metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions  of which many are significantly larger than carver federal and with greater financial resources 
additionally  various large out of state financial institutions may continue to enter the new york metropolitan area market 
all are considered competitors to varying degrees 
carver federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
competition for loans  both locally and in the aggregate  comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations 
most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
the bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
market area competition is a factor in pricing the bank loans and deposits  which could reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances 
the company profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas 
controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented  which may result in a material adverse effect on the company business 
management regularly reviews and updates the company internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on carver business  results of operations and financial condition 
carver and the bank operate in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of business activities 
carver federal is subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the occ and to a lesser extent the fdic 
the company is subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the federal reserve 
as a result  carver federal and the company are limited in the manner in which carver federal and the company conducts its business  undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors  and not to benefit the company stockholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  carver federal must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 
on october   the occ and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risk  or the guidance 
in general  the guidance applies to all residential mortgage loan products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower statement as to the borrower income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
the bank has evaluated the guidance for compliance  risk management practices and underwriting guidelines as they relate to originations and purchases of the subject loans  or practices relating to communications with consumers 
the guidance has no impact on the company loan origination and purchase volumes or the company underwriting procedures currently or in future periods 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact all financial institutions 
this impact may materially affect our business activities  financial position and profitability by  among other things 
increasing our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs  placing restrictions on certain products and services  and limiting our future capital raising strategies 
among the dodd frank act significant regulatory changes  it creates a new financial consumer protection agency  known as the bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau  that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection 
the bureau has exclusive authority to issue regulations  orders and guidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws 
the dodd frank act also eliminated our previous regulator  the ots and designated the comptroller of the currency to become our primary bank regulator 
moreover  the dodd frank act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and authorizes state attorney generals to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bureau 
the dodd frank act also may affect the preemption of state laws as they affect subsidiaries and agents of federally chartered banks  changes the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage  and increases the fdic assessment payable by the bank 
we expect that the bureau and these other changes will significantly increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services we offer to our customers 
the dodd frank act also imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by  among other things  imposing leverage ratios on bank holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as tier i capital 
these restrictions will limit our future capital strategies 
under the dodd frank act  our outstanding trust preferred securities will continue to count as tier i capital but we will be unable to issue replacement or additional trust preferred securities that would count as tier i capital 
because many of the dodd frank act provisions require subsequent regulatory rulemaking  we are uncertain as to the impact that some of the provisions will have on the company and cannot provide assurance that the dodd frank act will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for other reasons 
the company compliance with the orders is not assured 
the orders contain a number of requirements  including the requirement to raise capital such that carver federal maintains tier core capital and total risk based capital of at least and  respectively  and the requirement to substantially resolve problem assets 
on june   the company raised million and has contributed million to carver federal during fiscal year carver federal is in compliance with maintaining minimum capital levels 
however  no assurance can be made that carver federal will continue to remain in compliance 
carver federal also continues to have a high level of problem assets and no assurance can be made carver federal can resolve its asset problems with its current level of capital or in a time period acceptable to the occ 
the orders also place restrictions on growth in assets and changes in directors and management  as well as other requirements or restrictions 
although management believes it can comply with the requirements  no assurance can be made  and compliance with some of the provisions  such as growth restrictions  may adversely affect the results of operations 
for additional information regarding the orders please see the form k filed with the sec on february  our common stock may be delisted if we are not able to meet the nasdaq continued listing requirements 
on november   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market that the nasdaq hearings panel had made a determination to transfer the listing of the company common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market effective at the opening of the market on december  although we believe that we are now in compliance with all continued listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market  we may not be able to remain in compliance at all times 
if we fail to meet the continued listing requirements  our shares of common stock may be delisted and we may be forced to list our shares of common stock on another exchange or quotation service 
if this occurs  our common stock may become illiquid  and the price of our common stock may be negatively affected 
changes in laws  government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on results of operations 
financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is in the company control 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws  including with respect to federal and state taxation  may cause results of operations to differ materially 
in addition  cost of compliance could adversely affect carver ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for carver federal  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on carver federal  and therefore on the company results of operations 
on october   president bush signed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa into law in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of troubled assets including mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the us treasury  the federal reserve board and the fdic issued a joint statement announcing additional steps aimed at stabilizing the financial markets 
in this connection  the us treasury announced the troubled assets relief program tarp and the capital repurchase program cpp  a billion voluntary capital purchase program available to qualifying financial institutions that sell preferred shares to the us treasury to be funded from the billion authorized for troubled asset purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the foregoing or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets 
the failure of any such program or the us government to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions and the national and regional economy is expected to materially and adversely affect the company business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit and the trading price of the company common stock 
on january   the company became a tarp cpp participant by completing the sale of million in preferred stock to the us treasury 
as a participant  among other things  the company must adopt the treasury standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under this program 
these standards would generally apply to the company ceo  cfo and the three next most highly compensated officers senior executive 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required claw back of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation would likely increase slightly the overall cost of the company compensation programs 
the company also had to adopt certain monitoring and reporting processes 
on august   the company redeemed the preferred stock and issued million in series b preferred stock in connection with the company changing its participation from tarp cpp to tarp community development capital initiative cdci 
on october  carver shareholders approved the conversion of tarp cdci series b preferred stock to common stock 
on october   the treasury converted the cdci series b preferred stock to carver common stock 
under the terms of the agreement between the treasury and the company  the company agreed that so long as the treasury has an equity interest in the company  it will continue to be bound by all of the current restrictions and requirements that the treasury may choose to implement 
the company is unable to determine the impact that future restrictions and or requirements resulting from the treasury ownership interest may have on the company results of operations 
future federal deposit insurance corporation assessments will negatively impact our results of operations 
in november  the fdic issued a rule that required all insured depository institutions  with limited exceptions  to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the fdic also adopted a uniform three basis point increase in assessment rates effective on january  any additional emergency special assessment or increases in insurance premiums imposed by the fdic will likely negatively impact the company earnings 
the company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity 
liquidity refers to the company ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and to fulfill obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay wholesale borrowings  and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by customers 
the company primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities  cash flows from the sale of loans and securities  deposits gathered organically through the bank branch network  from socially motivated depositors  city and state agencies and deposit brokers and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlb ny 
in addition  and depending on current market conditions  the company has the ability to access the capital markets from time to time 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings  and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates  whether actual or perceived  local and national economic conditions and competition for deposits and loans in the markets the bank serves 
furthermore  changes to the fhlb ny underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict the bank ability to borrow  and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on liquidity 
a decline in available funding could adversely impact the bank ability to originate loans  invest in securities  and meet expenses  or to fulfill such obligations as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands 
the bank ability to pay dividends or lend funds to the company is subject to regulatory limitations that may prevent the company from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments on its debt obligation 
carver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the occ and federal reserve board and almost all of its operating assets are owned by carver federal 
carver relies primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders  to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation 
the occ regulates all capital distributions by the bank to the company  including dividend payments payments and the federal reserve board regulates dividends by the company 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  carver federal must file a notice or an application depending on the proposed dividend amount with the occ prior to each capital distribution 
the occ will disallow any proposed dividend that would result in failure to meet the occ minimum capital requirements 
in accordance with the orders  the bank and company are currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior regulatory approval  and  as such  suspended the regularly quarterly cash dividend on its common stock 
there are no assurances that the payments of dividends on the common stock will resume 
the regulators also precluded future payment of debenture interest payments on the carver statutory trust i capital securities 
these payments remain on deferral status 
carver may not be able to utilize its income tax benefits 
the company ability to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by new markets tax credit income tax benefits as well as other deferred tax assets depends on its ability to meet the nmtc compliance requirements and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income from operations to generate taxable income in the future 
since the bank has not generated sufficient taxable income to utilize tax credits as they were earned  a deferred tax asset has been recorded in the company financial statements 
for additional information regarding carver nmtc  refer to item  variable interest entities 
the future recognition of carver deferred tax asset is highly dependent upon carver ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required to be maintained for any deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in assessing carver need for a valuation allowance  we rely upon estimates of future taxable income 
although we use the best available information to estimate future taxable income  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances influencing our projections 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory rates  and future taxable income levels 
the company determined that it would not be able to realize all of its net deferred tax assets in the future  as such a charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal was made 
conversely  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made 
on june   the company raised million of equity 
the capital raise triggered a change in control under section of the internal revenue code 
generally  section limits the utilization of an entity net operating loss carry forwards  general business credits  and recognized built in losses upon a change in ownership 
the company is subject to an annual limitation of approximately million 
the company has a net deferred tax asset dta of approximately million 
based on management calculations  the section limitation has resulted in previous reductions of the deferred tax asset of million 
the company also continues to maintain a full valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax asset of million 
the company is unable to determine how much  if any of the remaining dta will be utilized 
carver faces system failure risks and security risks 
the computer systems and network infrastructure the company and its third party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
fire  power loss or other failures may effect carver computer equipment and other technology  or that of the company third party service providers 
also  the company computer systems and network infrastructure could be damaged by hacking and identity theft which could adversely affect the results of carver operations  or that of the company third party service providers 
the company business could suffer if it fails to retain skilled people 
the company success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges 
competition for the best people is intense  and the company size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees  which could adversely affect the results of operations

nm not meaningful item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
executive summary carver ended fiscal year with a return to profitability as it reported net income of million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal the majority of the net income in the current fiscal year is due to negative provision for loan losses recorded in the second half of the year 
the negative provision is primarily related to the decrease in non performing loans  the stabilization in valuations of non performing loans and a decrease in loss experience 
at march   non performing loans were million  or of total loans as compared to million  or of total loans at march  the business climate continues to present significant challenges and banks continue to compete for limited loan demand 
nevertheless  carver federal seeks to generate new loan production and purchase loans at suitable prices such that the outstanding loan portfolio increases during the fiscal year 
carver federal also intends to continue to focus on cost control 
however  carver federal continues to be impacted by expenses related to managing the non performing assets and higher fdic insurance and regulatory costs 
critical accounting policies various elements of accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
carver policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset are the most critical accounting policies 
these policies are important to the presentation of carver financial condition and results of operations  and involve a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
such assumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes in today economic environment 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan and lease losses the adequacy of the bank alll is determined  in accordance with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses the interagency policy statement released by the office of the comptroller of the currency on december  and in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic and asc topic compliance with the interagency policy statement includes management review of the bank loan portfolio  including the identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect a borrower ability to repay 
in addition  management reviews the overall portfolio quality through an analysis of delinquency and non performing loan data  estimates of the value of underlying collateral  current charge offs and other factors that may affect the portfolio  including a review of regulatory examinations  an assessment of current and expected economic conditions and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio are all taken into consideration 
the alll reflects management evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential  as well as the risk inherent in various components of the portfolio 
there is a great amount of judgment applied to developing the alll 
as such  there can never be assurance that the alll accurately reflects the actual loss potential inherent in a loan portfolio 
these assumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant change based on the current environment 
further  any change in the size of the loan portfolio or any of its components could necessitate an increase in the alll even though there may not be a decline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans 
general reserve allowance carver maintenance of a general reserve allowance in accordance with asc topic includes carver evaluating the risk to loss potential of homogeneous pools of loans based upon historical loss factors and a review of nine different environmental factors that are then applied to each pool 
the pools of loans loan type are family construction multifamily commercial real estate business loans sba loans other consumer and overdraft accounts the pools are further segregated into the following risk rating classes pass special mention substandard doubtful the bank next applies to each pool a risk factor that determines the level of general reserves for that specific pool 
the risk factors are generally comprised of actual losses for the most recent four quarters as a percentage of each respective loan type plus nine qualitative factors 
as the loss experience for a loan type increases or decreases  the level of reserves required for that particular loan type also increases or decreases 
because actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in a portfolio  the bank reviews nine qualitative factors to determine if reserves should be adjusted based upon any of those factors 
as the risk ratings worsen some of the qualitative factors tend to increase 
the nine qualitative factors the bank considers and may utilize are changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses policy procedures 
changes in relevant economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments economy 
changes in the nature or volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans nature volume 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff management 
changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of nonaccrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified loans problem assets 
changes in the quality of the loan review system loan review 
changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans collateral values 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations concentrations 
the effect of other external forces such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio external forces 
specific reserve allowance carver also maintains a specific reserve allowance for criticized classified loans individually reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic guidelines 
the amount assigned to the specific reserve allowance is individually determined based upon the loan 
the asc topic guidelines require the use of one of three approved methods to estimate the amount to be reserved and or charged off for such credits 
the three methods are as follows the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  the loan observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the institution may choose the appropriate asc topic measurement on a loan by loan basis for an individually impaired loan  except for an impaired collateral dependent loan 
guidance requires impairment of a collateral dependent loan to be measured using the fair value of collateral method 
a loan is considered collateral dependent when the repayment of the debt will be provided solely by the underlying collateral  and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment 
criticized and classified loans with at risk balances of  or more and loans below  that the credit officer deems appropriate for review  are identified and reviewed for individual evaluation for impairment in accordance with asc topic  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
carver also performs impairment analysis for all troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
if it is determined that it is probable the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according with the contractual terms of the loan agreement  the loan is categorized as impaired 
if the loan is determined to be not impaired  it is then placed in the appropriate pool of criticized classified loans to be evaluated for potential losses 
loans determined to be impaired are then evaluated to determine the measure of impairment amount based on one of the three measurement methods noted above 
if it is determined that there is an impairment amount  the bank then determines whether the impairment amount is permanent that is a confirmed loss  in which case the impairment is written down  or if it is other than permanent  in which case the bank establishes a specific valuation reserve that is included in the total alll 
in accordance with guidance  if there is no impairment amount  no reserve is established for the loan 
securities impairment the bank s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
on a quarterly basis  the bank reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
following fasb guidance  the amount of an other than temporary impairment  when there are credit and non credit losses on a debt security which management does not intend to sell  and for which it is more likely than not that the bank will not be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of the non credit impairment  the portion of the total impairment that is attributable to the credit loss would be recognized in earnings  and the remaining difference between the debt security s amortized cost basis and its fair value would be included in other comprehensive loss 
this guidance also requires additional disclosures about investments in an unrealized loss position and the methodology and significant inputs used in determining the recognition of other than temporary impairment 
at march   the bank does not have any securities that are classified as having other than temporary impairment in its investment portfolio 
deferred tax asset the company records income taxes in accordance with asc topic income taxes  as amended  using the asset and liability method 
income tax expense benefit consists of income taxes currently payable receivable and deferred income taxes 
temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes are measured as of the balance sheet date 
deferred tax liabilities or recognizable deferred tax assets are calculated on such differences  using current statutory rates  which result in future taxable or deductible amounts 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
where applicable  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion determined not likely to be realized 
this valuation allowance would subsequently be adjusted  by a charge or credit to income tax expense  as changes in facts and circumstances warrant 
on june   the company raised million of equity 
the capital raise triggered a change in control under section of the internal revenue code 
generally  section limits the utilization of an entity net operating loss carryforwards  general business credits  and recognized built in losses upon a change in ownership 
the company expects to be subject to an annual limitation of approximately million 
the company has a net deferred tax asset dta of approximately million 
based on management calculations the section limitation has resulted in previous reductions of the deferred tax asset of million 
a full valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax asset of million has been recorded 
asset liability management the company primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between the rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and the credit quality of earning assets 
management asset liability objectives are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity and to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the economic environment is uncertain regarding future interest rate trends 
management monitors the company cumulative gap position  which is the difference between the sensitivity to rate changes on the company interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the company uses various tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk  such as a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates 
discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis as a financial institution  the bank primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which are short term in maturity 
since virtually all of the company interest bearing assets and liabilities are held by the bank  most of the company interest rate risk exposure is retained by the bank 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank 
based upon the bank nature of operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank does not own any trading assets 
carver federal seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals between its assets and liabilities 
to a lesser extent  carver federal also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated changes in market value of its assets and liabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios 
as discussed more fully below  there are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income 
as illustrated below  carver federal had a negative one year gap equal to of total rate sensitive assets at march  as a result  carver federal net interest income may be negatively affected by rising interest rates and may be positively affected by falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities  prepayments and repricing of the major rate sensitive asset and liability categories of carver federal as of march  maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment 
the repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the bank actual results

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate 
virtually all of the adjustable rate loans in carver federal portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate 
economic value of equity eve analysis 
as part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates  management also uses the eve methodology 
eve is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off balance sheet contracts 
under this methodology  interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in eve that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of eve at both higher and lower interest rate risk scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 
presented below  as of march   is an analysis of the bank interest rate risk as measured by changes in eve for instantaneous parallel shifts of basis points change in market interest rates 
such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the bank current capital position 
the information set forth below relates solely to the bank  however  because virtually all of the company interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level  management believes the table below also similarly reflects an analysis of the company interest rate risk in thousands economic value of equity eve as of pv of assets change in rate amount change change eve ratio change bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in eve require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the eve table provides an indication of carver federal interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on carver federal net interest income and may differ from actual results

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the bank ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows  fund increases in its loan and investment portfolios and ongoing operating expenses 
the bank primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowed funds and principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
carver federal monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed by its management and approved by its board of directors 
carver federal several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a frequent basis 
the bank was in compliance with this policy as of march  management believes carver federal s short term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand  potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements 
additionally  carver federal has other sources of liquidity including the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny utilizing unpledged mortgage backed securities and certain mortgage loans  the sale of available for sale securities and the sale of certain mortgage loans 
net borrowings increased million during fiscal year as the bank added short term borrowings during the year to replace previously terminated long term borrowings 
at march   the bank had million in borrowings with a weighted average rate of maturing over the next three years 
the continued disruption in the credit markets has not materially impacted the company ability to access borrowings 
at march   based on available collateral held at the fhlb ny  carver federal had the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny an additional million on a secured basis  utilizing mortgage related loans and securities as collateral 
the bank most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the level of these assets is dependent on the bank operating  investing and financing activities during any given period 
at march  and  assets qualifying for short term liquidity  including cash and cash equivalents  totaled million and million  respectively 
the most significant potential liquidity challenge the bank faces is variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage refinance activity 
when mortgage interest rates decline  customers refinance activities tend to accelerate  causing the cash flow from both the mortgage loan portfolio and the mortgage backed securities portfolio to accelerate 
in contrast  when mortgage interest rates increase  refinance activities tend to slow  causing a reduction of liquidity 
however  in a rising rate environment  customers generally tend to prefer fixed rate mortgage loan products over variable rate products 
because carver federal generally sells its one to four family year and year fixed rate loan production into the secondary mortgage market  the origination of such products for sale does not significantly reduce carver federal s liquidity 
carver federal is also at risk to deposit outflows 
the transaction account guarantee program tag which provides temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage on noninterest bearing accounts expired on december  carver federal believes that the impact on noninterest bearing deposits will be minimal 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the change in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
during fiscal year  total cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million reflecting cash provided by operating activities of million offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash used by financing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities during this period was million and was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds on sale of held for sale loans of million offset by the negative provision for loan losses of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million primarily originated from a net inflow of loan activity by million  offset by investment activity of million and increase in restricted cash of million 
net cash used by financing activities was million  primarily resulting from decreased deposits of million offset by repayments and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings of million

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of carver federal operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on carver federal performance than do the effects of the general level of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
