part i item business 
we were incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on august  we are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies 
we design  develop and market our proprietary radio frequency rf technologies and products for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products 
based on the manner in which our management views and evaluates our operations  we have determined that our business currently operates under a single segment 
refer to our financial statements in item to this annual report for financial data including our revenues from external customers  net losses from operations  and total assets 
recent developments patent infringement litigation against qualcomm in february  the united states district court of the middle district of florida issued its claim construction ruling in our patent infringement litigation against qualcomm incorporated qualcomm 
in this ruling  the court adopted our interpretation for over ninety percent of the claim terms in dispute 
in addition  in january  the court dismissed with prejudice two of the three theories of inequitable conduct that qualcomm had asserted against us 
following this ruling  qualcomm notified the court of its intent to drop its remaining claims of inequitable conduct against us 
the court also dismissed qualcomm s claims against us and sterne kessler goldstein and fox  llc  our long time patent prosecution counsel  related to allegations of breach of contract 
we filed this patent infringement suit in july seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief for the infringement by qualcomm of six of our patents related to radio frequency receivers and the down conversion of electromagnetic signals 
the trial is scheduled to begin in october the law firm of mckool smith is representing us in this litigation on a partial contingency basis 
refer to legal proceedings in note to our financial statements included in item for a complete discussion of the proceedings in this matter 
development agreement with via telecom in march  we entered into a development agreement with via telecom  inc via for the development and support of custom interfaces  or drivers  between via s baseband products and our rf chipsets 
under the terms of the agreement  we will compensate via for the delivery and support of drivers that meet defined specifications 
via has also committed to provide ongoing support and maintenance for the drivers and the use of the via baseband chips for a period of no less than three years 
we believe the deliverables under this agreement will satisfy the requirements of handset oems who are considering the incorporation of our rf chipsets into mobile handset products for use with via baseband processors 
refer to general developments of business below for a complete discussion of our business relationship with via and related customer developments 
termination of via license in march  via agreed to a mutual termination of their license to our technology 
under the terms of the license agreement  via had the right to develop and manufacture via products which incorporated our intellectual property in return for a per unit royalty 
as more fully discussed below under general developments of business  our relationship with via had evolved to that of a supplier relationship which rendered the license unnecessary 
the termination of the license agreement has no impact on our current business relationship with via or the pursuit of orders from via baseband customers for the incorporation of our rf chipsets into their mobile products 
intellectual property strategy during  we engaged intellectual property strategy firms to assist us in analyzing our intellectual property in concert with our business objectives  in order to better evaluate and execute our strategic options for capturing the value of our innovations 
we believe opportunities exist in the mobile device industry  as well as numerous other industries  for intellectual property licensing  joint ventures  and or other business relationships that could provide us with additional sources of revenue from our patented innovations and thus increase shareholder value 
general development of business our business has been primarily focused on the development and marketing of our rf technologies for mobile applications 
our technologies represent unique  proprietary methods for processing rf waveforms in wireless applications 
our technologies apply to both transmit and receive functions of a radio transceiver 
a portion of our transmit technology is marketed as directpower  or dp  and enables the transformation of a baseband data signal to an rf carrier waveform  at the desired power output level  in a single unified operation 
a portion of our receiver technology is marketed as directdata  or dd  and enables the direct conversion of an rf carrier to a baseband data signal 
our product development and marketing efforts since have been primarily focused on certain of our transmit technologies  however  incorporation of our receiver technology in mobile applications is also contemplated in our product plans 
in addition  our patent infringement litigation against qualcomm is based on their use of our receiver technology 
since  we have generated no royalty or product revenue from our rf technologies 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs  our ability to secure a reasonable market share through product offerings with our customers  our ability to secure new customers for our technologies and or products  and or our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property 
we believe our intellectual property is a critical business asset and  as such  we have and will continue to devote substantial resources to the creation of intellectual property and the protection of our intellectual property rights by securing patent protection and  where necessary  defending those patents against infringement by others 
the resources dedicated to our rf chipset development activities serve a dual function in that many of these activities are also critical for the continued creation and protection of new intellectual property 
our lack of tenure in the mobile handset industry coupled with the unique nature of our technology has resulted in lengthy and intense technology evaluation and due diligence efforts by potential customers 
furthermore  in order to utilize rf technology in a mobile handset application  rf chipsets must interface with the baseband processor that generates the data to be transmitted 
the development of the interface between the baseband processor and rf chipsets requires a cooperative effort with the baseband provider 
our technology is capable of being incorporated for any of the mobile handset standards  as well as other applications 
our rf chipsets are being designed to interface with via baseband processors 
via is a global supplier of baseband processors used in a wide range of cdma enabled mobile devices that designs and supplies chipsets and related reference designs to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers for incorporation into mobile devices 
in december  we entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement with via  under the terms of which via had the right to manufacture devices based on our technology and pay us a per unit royalty for the license  however  the license also provided us with the right to manufacture and sell such devices ourselves to third parties 
to date  via has not produced its own rf chipsets 
since  we have worked with via to jointly develop a reference platform that would incorporate our products and via baseband processors without the exchange of intellectual property rights 
we anticipated that our initial product revenues would be generated from chipset sales to via and or its customers rather than through royalties under the license 
in addition  we worked with via to co develop a sample g mobile handset which verified our technology in a working implementation and tested our technology s performance 
the results of these efforts were utilized to market our product to via s customers 
during  we modified our circuit layout and packaging to meet the specific design requirements of one of via s customers 
the testing of our product in this design was completed in early despite the successful test results  this design did not result in an order from the prospective customer  however we were able to utilize the test results in marketing our solution to other via customers 
since mid year  we have been working with via and a mutual oem customer to design and test a handset solution incorporating our rf chipsets 
in late  the mutual customer requested commitments on the part of both ourselves and via to ensure adequate support of our products and the related interface between our products in order for our rf chipset to be considered for incorporation into one or more of the oem s products 
in march  we entered into a formal development agreement with via whereby we will compensate via for the resources required for their development and ongoing support and maintenance of the custom interfaces between our products 
we believe the development agreement with via will meet the requirements for our mutual customer for the products and support necessary to incorporate our rf chipsets into one or more of its mobile products 
simultaneous with the execution of the development agreement  the parties agreed to a mutual termination of the license agreement which had been rendered unnecessary by the nature of the development relationship between the parties 
the termination of the license agreement has no impact on our current business relationship with via 
itt corporation itt has been a licensee of our dp technology since from to  we provided itt with a development demonstration platform  supported itt in marketing our technology to their customers and seeking funding for product development  and provided subcontract services to itt under a government contract for a transceiver application for military product 
since  we have not been actively engaged in product development or other activities with itt  and we do not currently have plans to initiate any new development efforts for itt related projects  unless those projects are funded directly by itt or its customers 
in the event itt incorporates our technology into their products in the future  we will receive a per unit royalty from them for any such products sold under the terms of our agreement with them 
products and services we anticipate our future business will include both licensing of our intellectual property and the sale of integrated circuits based on our technology for incorporation into wireless devices designed by our customers 
in addition  from time to time  we offer engineering consulting and design services to our customers  for a negotiated fee  to assist them in developing prototypes and or products incorporating our technologies 
we are primarily focused on incorporating our technologies into mobile handsets for g and g cellular networks  but our technologies are applicable to other wireless products that incorporate rf transmitters  receivers  and or transceivers  some of which are related to networks serving mobile handsets such as tablets  data cards  femtocells  machine to machine  and embedded applications 
our technology can also be applied to non cellular radio applications such as military radios and cable modems 
competitive position we operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial  technical  and sales and marketing resources 
our technologies  which are currently being marketed in the mobile handset industry  face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers  such as broadcom  qualcomm  intel  renesas  st ericsson  fujitsu  mediatek  nvidia  and others  as well as incumbent providers of power amplifiers  including companies such as anadigics  rf microdevices  and skyworks  among others 
each of our competitors  however  also has the potential of becoming a customer for our technologies 
competition in our industry is generally based on price and technological performance 
to date  we are unaware of any competing or emerging rf technologies that provide all the simultaneous benefits that our technology enables 
our unique technologies process the rf carriers in a more optimal manner than traditional technologies  thereby allowing the creation of handsets and other products that have extended battery life  lower operating temperatures  more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors  and reduce manufacturing costs 
our technologies provide such attractive benefits  in part  because of their unique integrated circuit architectures which enable highly accurate transmission and reception of rf carriers that use less power than traditional linear architectures and components  thereby extending battery life  reducing heat and enabling certain packaging advantages 
hurdles to the adoption of our technologies include entrenchment of  and therefore familiarity with  existing technologies  the disruptive nature of our technology  and our lack of tenure in the markets we are targeting 
we believe we can gain adoption  and therefore compete  based on the performance advantages enabled by our unique circuit architectures  as supported by a solid and defensible patent portfolio 
our circuit architectures are capable of being compliant with all current mobile phone standards and can be configured to accept all standard baseband data interfaces with the cooperation of the baseband processor oems 
in addition  we believe that one or more of our technology s abilities to provide improved power efficiencies  highly accurate rf carrier waveforms  smaller form factors and better manufacturing yields  provides a solution to existing problems in applications for g and g standards and beyond that the mobile wireless industry is seeking to solve  as well as in other applications where we believe our technologies can provide an attractive solution 
production and supply the integrated circuits which incorporate our rf technologies are produced through fabrication relationships with ibm microelectronics ibm using a silicon germanium process and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc using a cmos semiconductor process 
we believe ibm and tsmc have sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs 
in addition  our integrated circuits have been and can be produced using different materials and processes  if necessary  to satisfy capacity requirements and or customer preferences 
in instances where our customer licenses our intellectual property  the production capacity risk shifts to that customer 
patents and trademarks we consider our intellectual property  including patents  patent applications  trademarks  and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
as of december   we had us and foreign patents related to our rf technologies 
in addition  we have approximately us and foreign patent applications pending 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years and our current portfolio of patents and patent applications has an average estimated remaining life of approximately years 
from time to time  we obtain licenses from others for standard industry circuit designs that are integrated into our own integrated circuits as supporting components that are peripheral to our core technologies 
we believe there are multiple sources for these types of standard circuits and we estimate the economic lives of the licenses to be two to five years based on estimated technological obsolescence 
research and development for the years ended december    and we spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on company sponsored research and development activities 
our research and development efforts have been  and are expected to continue to be  devoted to the development and advancement of rf technologies  including the development of prototype integrated circuits for proof of concept purposes  the development of production ready silicon samples and reference designs for specific customer applications  and the creation of test programs for quality control testing of our chipsets in high volumes 
employees as of december   we had full time and part time employees  of which are employed in engineering research and development  in sales and marketing  and in executive management  finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we consider our employee relations satisfactory

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our independent registered certified public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion on our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  a statement with respect to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
if we become unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements 
the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with our suppliers and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the future 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit which  at december   was approximately million 
the net loss for was approximately million 
to date  our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on marketing  research and development  pursuit of patent protection for and defense of our intellectual property  and operational costs for fulfillment of any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies 
we expect that our revenues in  if any  will not bring the company to profitability and our current capital resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations through if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or obtain sufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may also result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future 
failure to raise such additional capital may prevent us from implementing our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time 
we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  sales and marketing  and general operations 
furthermore  we expect that the implementation of significant cost reduction measures in order to reduce our cash needs would jeopardize our operations and future growth plans 
our current capital resources include cash and available for sale securities of million at december  our current capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for  and we will require additional capital to fund our operations 
financing  if any  may be in the form of debt or additional sales of equity securities  including common or preferred stock 
the incurrence of debt or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to us 
the sale of equity securities  including common or preferred stock  may result in dilution to the current shareholders ownership 
the long term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  additional funding  reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing 
the failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise capital or reduce expenses will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long term business objectives 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings 
for example  for both fiscal years and  we spent approximately million annually on research and development and  we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to generate revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our ability to do business will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if our existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
if our patents and intellectual property rights do not provide us with the anticipated market protections  our competitive position  business  and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property rights  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed  or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
as a result  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects 
on july   we filed a complaint in the united states district court of the middle district of florida against qualcomm incorporated seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief for infringement of a number of our patents related to radio frequency receivers and the down conversion of electromagnetic signals 
qualcomm has filed counterclaims against us  including claims of patent invalidity 
the court issued its claim construction ruling for this case in february and the trial date is set for october at this time  we do not believe it is possible to predict the outcome of the litigation 
we could continue to incur significant costs in this litigation and there can be no assurance that we will prevail or that any damages we receive will cover our costs 
furthermore  the litigation may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to pursue our business plan 
if we cannot demonstrate that our technologies and products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current competitive solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
we expect to face competition from chip suppliers such as anadigics  broadcom  fujitsu  intel  mediatek  nvidia  qualcomm  renesas  rf microdevices  skyworks  and st ericsson  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
if our technologies and products are not established in the market place as improvements over current  traditional chip solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our business is highly reliant on our business relationships with baseband suppliers for support of the interface of their product to our technology and the support of our sales and marketing efforts to their customers  the failure of which will have an adverse impact on our business 
the successful commercialization of our products will be impacted  in part  by factors outside of our control including the success and timing of product development and sales support activities of the suppliers of baseband processors with which our products interface 
delays in or failure of a baseband supplier s product development or sales support activities will hinder the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our technologies into their products and or market products based on our technologies 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements 
the failure of these business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffrey parker as our chief executive officer and mr 
david sorrells as our chief technology officer 
if either of their services were lost  it would have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan 
because of mr 
parker s leadership position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community  the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan 
because of mr 
sorrells technical expertise  the loss of his services could have an adverse impact on our research and technical support activities and impede the execution of our business plan 
if either mr 
parker or mr 
sorrells were no longer available to the company  investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment 
we currently have employment agreements with and maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit for both mr 
parker and mr 
sorrells 
if we are unable to attract or retain key executives and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to execute our current business plans 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our research  development and customer support activities 
the inability to obtain or retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the research  development and technical customer support activities that our products require 
these activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plan 
our outstanding options  warrants  and restricted share units may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  options  warrants  and restricted share units outstanding for the purchase and or issuance of shares of common stock 
of these outstanding equity instruments   were exercisable as of december  the majority of the underlying common stock of these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders ownership 
we may not be able to deliver shares of common stock upon exercise of our public warrants if such issuance has not been registered or qualified or deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrant 
on march   november   and march   we sold warrants to the public in offerings registered under shelf registration statements 
the issuance of common stock upon exercise of these warrants must qualify for exemption from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the warrant holder 
the qualification for exemption from registration may differ in different states 
as a result  a warrant may be held by a holder in a state where an exemption is not available for such exercise and we may be precluded from issuing such shares 
if our common stock continues to be listed on the nasdaq capital market or another national securities exchange  an exemption from registration in every state for the issuance of common stock upon exercise of these warrants would be available 
however  we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to be so listed 
as a result  these warrants may be deprived of any value  the market for these warrants may be limited and the holders of these warrants may not be able to obtain shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants if the common stock issuable upon such exercise is not qualified or otherwise exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and there are advance notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute 
we have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders 
on november   the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance  on november   as a dividend  of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock 
the rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them 
in the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid 
additionally  the rights have what are known as flip in and flip over provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly 
the principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid 
this plan may limit  prevent  or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction 
a negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders

executive overview we are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies 
we design  develop and market our proprietary rf technologies and products for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products 
since  we have generated no product or royalty revenue from our wireless technologies 
we have made significant investments in developing and protecting our technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
we are currently engaged in patent litigation with qualcomm for their alleged infringement of a number of our patents that relate to our receiver intellectual property 
we believe the outcome of this litigation is an important factor in our ability to generate meaningful revenue from certain of our receiver technologies 
therefore  we have devoted substantial resources to this litigation  and expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
the trial is scheduled to begin in october although our litigation team is working on a partial contingency basis  we expect to incur significant costs for legal and expert fees related to this litigation in and possibly beyond 
we have also devoted substantial resources to the development of rf products that interface with via s baseband processors 
as more fully discussed in recent developments under the heading item business  in march  we entered into a development agreement with via for the development and support of drivers between via s baseband products and our rf chipsets and the ongoing support and maintenance of the custom interfaces between our products 
we anticipate that we will pay via an aggregate of approximately million under this agreement in  provided that via meets all of the future development milestones specified in the agreement 
we have been working with via and a mutual customer since on the design and test of a mobile handset solution using our rf chipset 
much of the design and test process has been conducted in asia  and we have committed significant resources in personnel  travel  and prototype costs related to this project 
we believe our development agreement with via satisfies the requirements for the mutual customer and will provide the mutual customer with the products and support necessary to incorporate our rf chipsets into one or more of its mobile products 
in the event we secure product orders for our rf chipsets  we expect that available working capital will be used for initial production start up costs  including test programs and production tooling 
our current capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for  and we believe that the implementation of significant cost reduction measures in order to reduce our cash needs would jeopardize our operations and future growth plans 
our independent registered certified public accounting firm has included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of approximately million  an increase of approximately million from working capital of million at december  this increase is a result of approximately million in proceeds from our april and september sales of equity securities as well as approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  offset by the use of approximately million in cash for operating activities and the investment of approximately million in patents and other long lived assets in proceeds from the sale of equity securities are invested in available for sale securities and our use of cash is funded from the sale of these securities 
at december   we were not subject to any significant commitments to make additional capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million for operations and invested approximately million in patents and other long lived assets 
this use of cash was offset by approximately million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the exercise of warrants in the increase in our use of cash for operating activities from to was primarily the result of our increased operating expenses pertaining to our patent infringement litigation against qualcomm 
our future business plans call for continued investment in sales  marketing  customer support and product development for our technologies and products  as well as investment in continued protection of our intellectual property including prosecution of new patents and defense of existing patents 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies  our ability to secure a reasonable share of the market through additional product offerings with our customers  our ability to secure new customers for our products or technologies  and or our ability to defend our intellectual property 
any revenue generated from the sale of our rf chipsets to via s customers in will not be sufficient to cover our operational expenses  and we expect that our continued losses and use of cash will be funded from available working capital 
in addition  we expect that available working capital will be used for initial production start up costs  including test programs and production tooling  and for litigation expenses to defend our intellectual property 
our current capital resources will not be sufficient to support our liquidity requirements through furthermore  we believe significant cost reduction measures would jeopardize our operations and future growth plans  including our ability to support initial production of our products and our ability to defend our intellectual property 
we may be able to meet future liquidity needs through the issuance of additional equity securities under our outstanding shelf registration statement or otherwise  or through short or long term debt financing  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us 
we currently have no significant long term debt obligations 
the long term continuation of our business plan through and beyond is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies and or products to offset expenses 
in the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues  we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or further reduce operating costs 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital through debt or equity financings  and or further reduce operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long term business objectives 
results of operations for each of the years ended december    and revenues and gross margins we had no product or royalty revenues for the years ended december    or we recognized approximately  in service revenue for the year ended december  under a fixed price service contract with itt 
the contract was for the purpose of incorporating our commercially developed dp integrated circuits into a highly integrated transceiver for demonstration of device performance to one of itt s military customers 
cost of sales for engineering services includes the direct labor costs  as well as overhead and other indirect costs including depreciation and allocated facilities costs 
indirect costs are allocated to cost of sales on a direct labor hour basis 
for the year ended december   we recognized gross margin on the itt service contract of approximately  or 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering and related management and support personnel costs  fees for outside engineering design services which we use from time to time to supplement our internal resources  amortization and depreciation expense related to our patents and other assets used in product development  prototype production and materials costs  which represent the fabrication and packaging costs for prototype integrated circuits  as well as the cost of supporting components for prototype board development  software licensing and support costs  which represent the annual licensing and support maintenance for engineering design and other software tools  and rent and other overhead costs for our engineering design facility 
personnel costs include share based compensation which represents the grant date fair value of equity based awards to our employees which is attributed to expense over the service period of the award 
research and development costs remained relatively unchanged from to this is primarily a result of an increase in personnel and related costs  offset by a decrease in outside engineering design services 
personnel and related costs increased by approximately  from to as a result of an increase in personnel during mid as well as an increase in incentive compensation to key personnel in outside engineering design services decreased by approximately  from to as a result of fluctuations that occur from year to year depending upon the status and timing of various outsourced projects 
research and development expenses decreased approximately million  or from to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in employee share based compensation  depreciation and amortization expenses  and prototype costs  offset by increases in outside engineering design services  travel costs  and other professional fees 
share based compensation costs for research and development personnel decreased by approximately  from to primarily as a result of certain awards from becoming fully vested and lower compensation cost being recognized on more recent awards due to the type of award and the market price of our common stock on the award date 
depreciation and amortization expense for research and development decreased by approximately  from to  primarily as the result of decreased amortization on third party licenses related to prototype designs 
prototype production and materials costs decreased by approximately  from to  primarily as a result of reduced prototype runs of our integrated circuits at the ibm and tsmc foundries in as we focused our resources on implementing our integrated circuits into designs for via customers 
outside engineering design fees increased by approximately  from to based on the timing of various projects related to supporting mobile handset designs by via customers 
personnel travel increased by approximately  from to  primarily as a result of increased domestic and international travel to provide technical support to via and their handset customers for our products during the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
we are committed to continue investing in our technology and product development and therefore we anticipate that we will use a substantial portion of our working capital for research and development activities in marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including share based compensation and travel costs  and outside professional fees which consist of various consulting and legal fees related to sales and marketing activities 
marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to this increase is primarily due to an increase in outside professional fees of approximately  as a result of outsourced support for a potential customer in asia and an increase in certain public relations activities 
marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in share based compensation expense of approximately  as a result of certain awards from becoming fully vested and lower compensation cost being recognized on more recent awards due to the type of award and the market price of our common stock on the award date 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  director  finance and administrative personnel costs  including share based compensation  and costs incurred for insurance  shareholder relations and outside professional services  including litigation fees 
our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to this increase was due primarily to increases in litigation fees and expenses of approximately  an increase in various consulting fees of approximately  and an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately  this increase in litigation fees and expenses relates to our patent infringement litigation against qualcomm 
the increases represent costs for experts and other third party services  as well as increases in legal fees incurred as the case progresses 
our litigation team is working on a partial contingency basis  and as a result  their fees have been reduced in exchange for a contingent fee in the event an award is received 
we anticipate additional increases in litigation fees and expenses in as we prepare for an october trial 
the increase in consulting fees is a result of one time increases in various intellectual property strategy  investor relations  and financial advisory fees incurred in these increases are not expected to be sustained in the increase in share based compensation expense is primarily the result of new long term equity incentive awards granted to executives  other administrative employees  and non employee directors 
in addition  share based compensation included  of expense recognized upon the june vesting of performance based rsus issued to a third party for investor relations consulting services 
our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to this increase was due primarily to increases in outside professional fees partially offset by decreases in employee share based compensation expense 
outside professional fees increased approximately  from to primarily as a result of legal and other expert professional services related to our patent litigation against qualcomm initiated in july share based compensation decreased by approximately  from to primarily as a result of certain awards from becoming fully vested in and lower compensation cost being recognized on more recent awards due to the type of award and the market price of our common stock on the award date 
interest and other income interest and other income consist of interest earned on our investments  net gains realized upon the sale of available for sale securities  and other miscellaneous income 
interest and other income decreased approximately million or from to primarily as a result of lower average interest rates earned on investment balances 
interest and other income remained relatively unchanged from to loss and loss per common share our net loss increased approximately million  or per common share  from to this increase was a result of the million increase in operating expenses  which includes a million increase in litigation fees and expenses and a million increase in overall share based compensation expense 
the increase in the loss per common share is a result of the increased net loss  offset by a increase in weighted average shares outstanding for the period 
our net loss decreased approximately million  or per common share  from to this decrease was the result of a million  or  reduction in operating expenses and  with respect to the loss per common share  a increase in weighted average shares outstanding for the period 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of our financial statements intangible assets patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents and copyrights to be fifteen to twenty years 
we estimate the economic lives of other intangible assets  including licenses  based on estimated technological obsolescence  to be two to five years  which is generally shorter than the contractual lives 
periodically  we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate impairment exists triggering event 
based on our cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operations to date  we assess our working capital needs on an annual basis 
this annual assessment of our working capital is considered to be a triggering event for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of our intangible assets 
as a result of our evaluation at december   we determined that no impairment exists with regard to our intangible assets 
accounting for share based compensation we calculate the fair value of share based equity awards to employees  including restricted stock  stock options and restricted stock units  on the date of grant and recognize the calculated fair value  net of estimated forfeitures  as compensation expense over the requisite service periods of the related awards 
the fair value of share based awards is determined using various valuation models which require the use of highly subjective assumptions and estimates including i how long employees will retain their stock options before exercising them  ii the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the equity award  and iii the rate at which equity awards will ultimately be forfeited by the recipients 
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized as expense in the statements of comprehensive loss 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on loss before taxes as reported in the accompanying statements of comprehensive loss 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax assets exclude unrecognized tax benefits which do not meet a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
off balance sheet transactions  arrangements and other relationships as of december   we have outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the sale of equity securities in various private placement transactions in   and these warrants have exercise prices ranging from to per share with a weighted average exercise price of and a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately years 
the estimated aggregate fair value of these warrants at their date of issuance of  is included in shareholders equity in our balance sheets 
refer to non plan options and warrants in note to our financial statements included in item for information regarding the outstanding warrants 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  were as follows see lease commitments in note to the financial statements included in item payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years after years capital leases operating leases item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash equivalents  which are primarily highly liquid money market instruments  and our available for sale securities  which are mutual funds invested primarily in short term municipal securities  are subject to market risk  including interest rate risk 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market and economic conditions and is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our funds by investing in market instruments with limited market risk 
accordingly  we do not believe there is any material market risk exposure with respect to our market instruments
