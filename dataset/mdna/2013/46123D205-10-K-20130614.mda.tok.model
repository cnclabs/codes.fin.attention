item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview we are the pioneer and a global market leader in devices for the motion interface market that detect and track an object s motion in three dimensional space 
our motiontracking devices combine micro electro mechanical system  or mems motion sensors  such as accelerometers  gyroscopes and compasses  with mixed signal integrated circuits ics and proprietary algorithms and firmware that intelligently process  synthesize and calibrate the output of sensors for use by software applications via an application programming interface api 
our motiontracking devices are differentiated by small form factor  high level of integration  performance  reliability and cost effectiveness 
while our solutions have broad applicability  we currently target consumer electronics applications such as smartphones and tablets  console and portable video gaming devices  digital still and video cameras  smart tvs including digital set top boxes  televisions and multi media hdds  navigation devices  toys  and health and fitness accessories 
we utilize a fabless model  leveraging current cmos and mems foundries and semiconductor packaging supply chains 
our current strategy is to continue targeting the consumer electronics market with integrated motiontracking devices that meet or exceed the performance and cost requirements of consumer electronics manufacturers  are easy to integrate and set industry performance benchmarks 
our ability to secure new customers depends on winning competitive processes  known as design wins 
these selection processes are typically lengthy  and  as a result  our sales cycles will vary based on the market served  whether the design win is with an existing or a new customer and whether our product being designed into our customer s device is a first generation or subsequent generation product 
because the sales cycle for our products is long  we can incur design and development support expenditures in circumstances where we do not ultimately recognize any net revenue 
we do not receive long term purchase commitments from any of our customers  all of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis 
while product life cycles in our target market vary by application  once one of our solutions is incorporated into a customer s design  we believe that it will likely remain a component of the customer s product for its life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative solution 
the trend is also supported by the increased likelihood that once a customer introduces one of our products into one of their devices  we believe they are likely to introduce it into others 
additionally  once a customer introduces one of our lower functionality sensors into their platforms  we believe they are more likely to adopt our more advanced integrated motiontracking devices 
the history of our product development and sales and marketing efforts is  on a calendar year basis  as follows from our inception in through  we were primarily engaged in the design and development of our analog gyroscopes 
in this period  we also developed and refined our fabrication process  which we refer to as our patented fabrication platform 
in  we began volume shipments of our idg family of integrated x y dual axis analog gyroscopes for the compact digital camera market  the first commercially available sensors of that type 
subsequently  through  we developed and shipped successive generations of these gyroscopes with enhanced performance and reduced die sizes 
we began high volume shipments of our idg to nintendo beginning in may in  we began shipping enhanced and alternative versions of our single and dual axis analog gyroscopes as well as our itg family of x y z three axis digital output gyroscopes 
we also 
table of contents significantly accelerated shipments of our products due to the broad market adoption of the nintendo wii motionplus accessory 
in addition  we migrated our manufacturing processes to larger wafer sizes enabling significant cost efficiencies 
in  we began volume shipments of our mpu family of motion processors consisting of three axis gyroscopes digital outputs and software development kits  designed to enable faster motion interface application development 
in addition  we started shipping our itg and imu family of products  which address a broader array of consumer applications than our analog products 
we also started sampling our mpu family of integrated six axis motion processors that integrate a three axis gyroscope and three axis accelerometer on one chip used with our motionapps software platform 
in  we began high volume shipments of our itg imu mpu family of motion processors for the portable gaming  smart tv  smartphone and tablet markets 
in addition  we began volume shipments of our mpu family of six axis motion processors for the smartphone and tablet markets 
we also introduced our idg and ixz families of dual axis gyroscopes  which address the need for optical image stabilization ois technology in camera phones and digital still cameras 
in  we introduced our nine axis mpu motion processor to selected customers  targeted for the smartphone  tablet  gaming controller and wearable sensor markets 
in  we also introduced our mpu  a single chip  high performance integrated axis gyroscope for industrial applications 
in  we also introduced the mpu  the company s next generation axis motiontracking device for smartphones  tablets  wearable sensors  and other consumer markets 
in january  we introduced the mpu  an integrated accelerometer  gyroscope  compass in a xxmm package with mw power consumption  ideal for mobile devices  wearable sensors for sports and remote health monitoring  and emerging applications 
in february  we introduced the mpu  an integrated accelerometer  gyroscope  and electronic compass in a xxmm package that has a lower power consumption than its predecessor 
in february  we also introduced the itg  with an industry first mm height and lowest power consumption of only mw ma at v 
our net revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  respectively 
at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we achieved positive operating cash flow of million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we achieved net income of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net revenue we derive our net revenue from sales of our motiontracking devices 
we primarily sell our products through our worldwide sales organization to manufacturers of consumer electronics devices from whom we have secured a design win 
the sale may be executed directly with the manufacturer or via the manufacturer s supply chain to their designated contract manufacturer 
we also sell our products through an indirect channel of distributors that fulfill orders for our products from manufacturers of consumer electronics devices  original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
fiscal year in thousands net revenue 
table of contents net revenue for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  primarily due to higher volume shipments to an expanded customer base  including manufacturers of smartphones  tablet devices and digital television and set top box remote controls  partially offset by lower volume shipments to gaming manufacturers and by per unit sold average selling price erosion 
total unit shipments for fiscal year increased by year over year 
our overall average unit selling price for fiscal year decreased year over year as a result of the change in our product mix and declines in average selling prices associated with products primarily introduced in prior years 
we expect a continued trend of declining unit average selling prices for our products during their life cycles 
net revenue for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  primarily due to higher volume shipments to an expanded customer base  including manufacturers of smartphones  tablet devices and digital television and set top box remote controls 
total unit shipments for fiscal year increased by year over year 
our overall average unit selling price for fiscal year decreased year over year as a result of the change in our product mix and declines in average selling prices associated with products primarily introduced in prior years 
for fiscal three customers accounted for samsung  nintendo and quanta of total net revenue 
for fiscal year three customers accounted for nintendo  htc and samsung of total net revenue

no other customers accounted for more than of total net revenue for fiscal years  or net revenue by target end market fiscal year in thousands smartphone and tablet devices of net revenue gaming of net revenue other of net revenue net revenue growth and contribution to total net revenue for the smartphone tablet end market in fiscal years and reflects significant expansion of the smartphone portion of the handset market  growth in the market for tablet computing devices  and increased adoption of our technologies in those devices during that time period 
the net revenue decline and contribution to total net revenue for the gaming end market in fiscal years and reflects a declining consumer market for console gaming and shift to mobile device and online gaming during that time period 
net revenue by geographic region region fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands korea japan taiwan united states china rest of world 
table of contents we primarily sell our products directly to customers and distributors in asia which consists primarily of korea  japan  taiwan and china 
sales into asia constituted of our net revenue in fiscal year compared with of our net revenue in fiscal year and of our net revenue for the fiscal year we believe that a substantial majority of our net revenue will continue to come from sales to customers located in asia  where most of the manufacturers of consumer electronics devices that use and may in the future use our products are located 
as a result of this regional customer concentration  we may be subject to economic and political events and other developments that impact our customers in asia 
for more information  see the section titled risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of manufacturing  packaging  assembly and testing costs for our products  shipping costs  costs of personnel  including stock based compensation  warranty costs and write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
fiscal year in thousands cost of revenue of net revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  due to an increase in unit sales of our products  partially offset by improvements in our production yields and efficiency 
cost of revenue for the fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  due to an increase in unit sales of our products  partially offset by improvements in our production yields and efficiency and lower warranty costs 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit is the difference between net revenue and cost of revenue and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change 
typically we experience price decreases over the life cycle of our products  which may vary by market and customer 
as a result  if we are not able to decrease the cost of our products in line with the price decreases of our products  we may experience a reduction in our gross profit and gross margin 
gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including demand for our products and services  our ability to add new product features to our existing products  the rate of adoption of our products by new markets  product manufacturing cost and yields  write downs of inventory for excess quantity and technological obsolescence  benefit from sale of previously written down inventories  product mix  
table of contents erosion of average selling prices  as required by agreements entered into with our customers and in anticipation of competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us and our competitors  product end of life programs  and for other reasons  the proportion of our products that are sold through direct versus indirect channels  our ability to attain volume manufacturing pricing from our foundry partners and suppliers  and growth in our headcount and other related costs incurred in our organization 
fiscal year in thousands gross profit of net revenue gross profit for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  due to an increase in unit sales of our products and the favorable effect of the sale of previously written down inventories  partially off set by decreases in average selling price per unit sold for comparable products 
gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  decreased on the effect of reductions in average selling price per unit sold for comparable products and changes in product mix sold  partially offset by the benefit of the sale of previously written down inventories for fiscal year of million  or of net revenue and by improvements in our production yields and efficiency 
we expect gross margins to fluctuate during future periods due to changes in product mix  average unit selling prices  manufacturing costs  manufacturing yields and levels of product demand 
gross profit for the fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  due to higher volume shipments of our products to an expanded customer base  including manufacturers of smartphones  tablet devices and digital television and set top box remote controls  year over year improvements in our production yields and efficiency  and lower warranty costs in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  also increased due to improvements in our production yields and efficiency  partially offset by a write down of inventory related to excess and obsolete material for fiscal year of million  or of net revenue 
research and development research and development expense primarily consists of personnel related expenses including employee cash compensation and benefits  and stock based compensation  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
research and development activities include the design of new products  refinement of existing products and processes and design of test methodologies  including hardware and software to ensure compliance with required specifications 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase on an absolute basis as we continue to expand our product offerings and enhance existing products 
fiscal year in thousands research and development of net revenue research and development expense for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in employee cash compensation and benefits costs due to an increase in the number of employees  a million increase in stock based compensation expense due to an increase in the number of employees  and a million increase in mask and foundry 
table of contents expenses 
research and development headcount was at the end of fiscal year and at the end of fiscal year additions to headcount primarily supported expansion of new product and future technology development activities 
research and development expense for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in employee cash compensation and benefits costs due to an increase in the number of employees  a million increase in mask and foundry expenses  a million increase in outside service costs and a million increase in stock based compensation expense due an increase in the number of employees 
research and development headcount was at the end of fiscal year and at the end of fiscal year additions to headcount primarily supported expansion of new product development activities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel related expenses including employee cash compensation and benefits  and stock based compensation  sales commissions  field application engineering support  travel costs  professional and consulting fees  legal fees  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute basis in the future as we expand our sales  marketing  finance and administrative personnel  and we incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company 
fiscal year in thousands selling  general and administrative of net revenue selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in employee cash compensation and benefits costs due to an increase in the number of employees  a million increase in stock based compensation driven by an increase in the number of employees  a million increase in legal costs due primarily to patent litigation activities  and a million increase in outside service costs 
executive separation costs of million were included in employee compensation and benefits costs and executive separation costs of million were included in stock based compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative headcount increased to at the end of fiscal year from year over year 
additions to headcount primarily supported expanded geographic  customer and market opportunities for our products 
selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year 
the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in employee cash compensation and benefits costs of million resulting from increased headcount  increased stock based compensation expense of million due to increased headcount and increased facilities and infrastructure cost of million  partially offset by the write off of deferred offering costs of million in the third quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative headcount increased to at the end of fiscal year from year over year 
additions to headcount primarily supported expanded geographic  customer and market opportunities for our products 
income from operations fiscal year in thousands income from operations of net revenue

income from operations for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  primarily due to increased unit shipments  increased gross profit and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
other income expense  net fiscal year in thousands change in fair value of warrant liabilities other income  net other income expense  net of net revenue other income expense  net increased by million  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in other income expense was primarily due to increased interest income of million on higher investment balances  off set by decreases in gains on sale of fixed assets compared to fiscal year other income expense  net decreased by million  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the change in other income expense was primarily due to changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded charges of million resulting from the increase in fair value of warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock  compared to million recorded in fiscal year effective june   we amended our certificate of incorporation to remove certain provisions from our preferred stock that had resulted in our warrants being previously classified as liabilities 
on that date  the fair value of the warrants  million  was reclassified to stockholders equity 
accordingly  for periods after june   we were not required to reflect changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in our consolidated statements of income 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes consists of our estimated federal  state and foreign income taxes based on our pre tax income 
our provision differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign tax differentials  research and development tax credits  and expenses that are not deductible such as certain stock based compensation 
fiscal year in thousands income tax provision of income before income taxes in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision of million compared to an income tax provision of million for fiscal year the difference between fiscal year compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate resulting from foreign rate differentials  increased research and development tax credits and stock based compensation deductions 
in addition  during fiscal year  we also changed our estimate of earnings attributable to our domestic versus foreign operations earned for the fiscal year 
as a result of an increase in the amount of earnings attributable to foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates  we adjusted our tax provision in fiscal year to reflect these new estimates  to the extent that the adjustments related to prior periods  the income tax impact was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year and is a 
table of contents component of our annual effective tax rate 
the impact of recording this change in estimate  along with the results of operations for the fiscal year  gave rise in fiscal year to an income tax benefit of million 
in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision of million  compared to an income tax provision of million for fiscal year our fiscal year effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to profits earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the us tax rate and the benefit of the federal research and development income tax credit 
the income tax provision was also unfavorably impacted by the effects of non deductible stock based compensation expense 
the provision for income tax differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory tax rate to income before income taxes as follows fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year income tax provision at the federal statutory rate state tax  net of federal benefit research and development credits foreign tax rate differential non deductible stock compensation change in fair value of warrant liabilities change in valuation allowance other effective tax rate net income fiscal year in thousands net income of net revenue net income for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  primarily due to increased unit shipments  increased gross profit and a lower effective tax rate 
net income for fiscal year increased by million  or  year over year  primarily due to increased unit shipments  increased gross profit  the absence of charges related to warrants to purchase preferred stock and a decrease in the effective tax rate 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality tables setting forth our unaudited consolidated statements of operations for each quarter of fiscal years  and  may be found in note  quarterly financial data unaudited  in our notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this annual report on form k  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
the quarterly data have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included later in this annual report on form k and include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information set forth below 
sales of video gaming consoles  portable video gaming devices and certain smartphone and tablet models tend to be weighted towards holiday periods 
as a result  historically  our customers in this market tend to 
table of contents increase production of products incorporating our solutions in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year in order to build inventories 
sales of our products tend to correspondingly increase during these periods and to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
we expect this seasonality to continue in future periods  although we expect the magnitude of this seasonality to decrease as we increase sales to manufacturers of smartphones and tablet devices relative to sales to gaming manufacturers 
we believe the quarterly sales progression for smartphones and tablet devices is less subject to seasonality due to the fact that end customer demand is also driven by upgrade cycles that typically occur throughout the year 
in addition  the impact of new product introductions and overall macroeconomic trends can mitigate the impact of seasonality 
we have limited visibility into future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require  which could adversely affect our net revenue forecasts and operating margins 
in addition to the impact of competitive pricing pressures  we have also experienced fluctuations in gross profit generally due to variability in our quarterly net revenue as well as manufacturing cost efficiencies which can be influenced by fluctuations in manufacturing process yields as well as introductions of new less expensive to manufacture products 
our products are manufactured by third party manufacturers according to our estimates of future customer demand  of which we have limited visibility 
if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  we may be unable to obtain adequate and cost effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third party manufacturers to meet our customers delivery requirements  or we may accumulate excess inventories  which could adversely impact our gross margins 
our operating expenses generally increased over the twelve quarters in fiscal years  and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of our increase in headcount related to our investment in the development of new products and our corporate infrastructure to support higher levels of sales and to operate as a public company 
we base our planned operating expenses on our expectations of future net revenue 
if net revenue for a particular quarter is lower than expected  we may be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds of million from the issuance of shares of our preferred stock  net proceeds of million from the issuance of shares in public offerings and million  million and million in cash generated from operations in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of march  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
although the majority of our sales in fiscal years  and were generated from a limited number of customers  we increased the number of total customers and the volume of sales to those customers during fiscal years  and we expect that trend to continue as the markets for our products develop 
we believe our current cash  along with net cash provided by operating activities  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next months 
we also believe our current cash  along with net cash provided by operating activities position us to pursue value creating acquisitions if opportunities arise 
our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of a decline in sales of our products due to a decline in our end markets  decrease in sales of our customers products in the market  or adoption of competitors products 
additionally  million of the million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of march  if these funds are needed for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the united states  and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

table of contents our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses  purchases of inventory and the acquisition of property and equipment 
cash used to fund operating expenses excludes the impact of non cash items such as depreciation and stock based compensation and is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our primary sources of cash are cash receipts on accounts receivable from our shipment of products to customers and distributors 
aside from the growth in amounts billed to our customers  net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process  which can vary from period to period depending on the payment cycles of our major customers and distributors 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by million during the year ended march   primarily due to the purchase of short term and long term investments 
the change in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal  and was as follows fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents total cash and cash equivalents accounted for and of total assets at march  and april  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million primarily reflected net income of million  and non cash expenses of million  partially off set by a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million consisting primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and an increase in inventories of million  partially off set by an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in accrued liabilities of million 
the movements in working capital were primarily based on the changes in accounts receivables  prepaid and other current assets and inventories resulting from our increase in sales volume 
non cash expenses of million consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  partially off set by million change in deferred income taxes 
the million increase in accounts receivable principally relates to increased gross billings to distributors and oems  associated with an upward trend in demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared with the same period in fiscal year the million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily attributed to higher advances to vendors  income tax receivable and prepaid expenses 
the million increase in inventories was attributable to increased production of products partially offset by lower inventory reserves in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared with the same period in fiscal year the million increase in accounts payable was due primarily to higher inventory receipts to support the increased production of products along with the timing related to the payment of trade accounts 
the million increase in accrued liabilities is due primarily to an increase in income tax reserves and accrued former ceo separation costs  partially offset by lower accrued bonuses 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million primarily reflected net income of million  non cash expenses of million and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million consisting primarily of a decrease in inventory of million  and an increase in accrued liabilities of million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in prepaid and other current assets of million  an increase in other assets of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the movements in working capital were primarily based on the changes in accounts receivables resulting from our increase in sales volume  a decrease in inventory due to our inventory reduction efforts and an increase in other accrued liabilities driven by an increase in headcount 
non cash expenses of million consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million primarily reflected net income of million  non cash expenses of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the movements in working capital were primarily based on the changes in accounts receivables  inventory and accounts payable resulting from our increase in sales volume and an increase in other accrued liabilities driven by an increase in headcount 
the non cash expenses of million consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million and the revaluation of warrants of million 
net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year of million primarily reflected the purchase of property and equipment of million  and the purchase of available for sale investments of million  partially off set by the sale and maturity of available for sale investments of million 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year of million primarily reflected the purchase of property and equipment of million and includes the sale of available for sale investments of million and the purchase of available for sale investments of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year of million included proceeds from the maturity of short term investments of million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of short term investments of million 
net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year of million resulted primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and excess tax benefit from stock based compensation of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year of million resulted primarily from proceeds from public offerings  net of underwriter commissions of million 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year of million consisted primarily of million for the repayment of equipment financing  million in offering costs paid during the period and million for the repayment of refundable customer advances  offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of march  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands unaudited operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of contractual obligations from agreements for non cancelable office space 
purchase obligations consist of the minimum purchase commitments made to contract manufacturers 
on may   we signed a new non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters through december future minimum lease payments under the new corporate headquarters operating lease as of may  are as follows fiscal years ending march or april amount in thousands beyond total included in our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance of million at march are million of tax positions which would affect income tax expense if recognized 
as of march  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits would be offset by a change in valuation allowance 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the year in which the future cash flows may occur 
as a result  these amounts are not included in the tables above 
warranties and indemnification in connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business  we often make representations affirming  among other things  that our products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and agree to indemnify customers against third party claims for such infringement 
further  our bylaws require us to indemnify our officers and directors against any action that may arise out of their services in that capacity 
we have not been subject to any material liabilities under such provisions and therefore believe that our exposure for these indemnification obligations is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these indemnity agreements as of march  off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special 
table of contents purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of march   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income which requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholder s equity 
asu no 
became effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which is our fiscal interim period ended july  of fiscal year ending march  upon adoption of asu no 
 we have separately reported consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the adoption did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu no 
will become effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which is our fiscal interim period ended june  of fiscal year ending march   and the adoption will not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements and the related notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue  costs  and expenses  and any related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and related notes using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference is expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider positive and negative evidence such as historical levels of income or loss  projections of future income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realizable  we would increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future federal  state and foreign taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 

table of contents we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign countries  and we expect to be subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgment and estimates 
we believe that our provision for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is adequate based on information currently available to us 
the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
our overall provision requirement could change due to the issuance of new regulations or new case law  negotiations with tax authorities  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  or the entire audit  or the expiration of statutes of limitation 
we have expanded our international operations and staff  and will continue to do so in the future  to better support our expansion in international markets 
this business expansion has included an international structure that  among other things  consists of research and development cost sharing arrangements  certain licenses and other contractual arrangements between us and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
these arrangements may result in a lower percentage of our pre tax income being subject to a relatively higher us federal statutory tax rate 
as a result  our effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the us federal statutory rate 
however  the realization of any expected tax benefits is contingent upon numerous factors  including the judgments of tax authorities in several jurisdictions  and thus cannot be assured 
the company has not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as in general  it is the practice and intention of the company to reinvest the earnings of its non us subsidiaries in those operations 
the company has not made a provision for us or additional foreign withholding taxes on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration of approximately million and million at march and april  respectively 
generally  such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or its current estimated market value 
inventories include finished good parts that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence 
we periodically review the quantities and carrying values of inventories to assess whether the inventories are recoverable 
write down of inventory for excess quantity and technological obsolescence are charged to cost of revenues as incurred 
actual demand may materially differ from our projected demand  and this difference could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory or a benefit from sales of inventory previously written down 
write down amounts charged credited to cost of revenues for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity incentive awards  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to estimate certain key assumptions including future stock price volatility  expected term of the options  risk free rates  and dividend yields 
in fiscal  of our stock based awards contained a market based condition for vesting  these awards were valued using a monte carlo simulation analysis to model and value multiple possible outcomes 
we also estimate potential forfeiture of equity incentive awards granted and adjust compensation expense accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is 
table of contents adjusted over the estimated term to the extent that the actual forfeiture rate or expected forfeiture rate is expected to differ from these estimates 
the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method and classify these amounts in the statements of income based on the department to which the related employee is assigned 
for fiscal years  and  we recognized stock based compensation of million  million and million  respectively 
if any of the assumptions in the black scholes option pricing model changes significantly  stock based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared to awards granted previously 
we estimate our expected volatility and expected term based on trading history and exercise history  respectively 
we derive the risk free interest rate assumption using the published interest rate for a us treasury zero coupon issue having a maturity similar to the expected term of the options 
we base the assumed dividend yield on the expectation that we will not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we utilized our historical forfeiture rates since inception to estimate our future forfeiture rate 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of estimating the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on stock based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all stock compensation expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million at march   which was held for liquidity purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
a change in interest rates will not have a significant impact on our future interest income or investment fair value 
as of march   our cash  cash equivalents and investments were in money market funds  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and us agency securities 
foreign currency risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our net revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk 
however  a portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the us  are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the new taiwan dollar  japanese yen and korean won 
additionally  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of income 
we recognized no significant foreign currency transaction gains or losses for fiscal years  and related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
