item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to such statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under the heading risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
all references to  and refer to our calendar years ended december    and  respectively 
overview we are a life sciences company providing innovative genetic analysis solutions to improve healthcare through our two operating segments molecular diagnostics  in which our wholly owned molecular diagnostic reference laboratory  sequenom center for molecular medicine  llc or sequenom cmm performs molecular diagnostic testing services utilizing its laboratory developed tests ldts which are currently focused on noninvasive prenatal and women health related diagnostics and ophthalmology related diagnostics and plans to develop or acquire additional diagnostic tests in those and other fields including autoimmunity  neurology and oncology 
patient samples are collected by health care professionals and submitted to sequenom cmm for testing and test results are reported back to the ordering physician 
sequenom cmm first ldt was launched in genetic analysis  which currently provides research use only products  services and applications that translate the results of genomic science into solutions for biomedical research  translational research  molecular medicine applications  and other areas of research  including agricultural and livestock 
our molecular diagnostics segment  through our subsidiary sequenom cmm  has validated and currently offers to physicians four ldts maternit plus ldt maternit plus test to detect fetal aneuploidies or trisomies by determining the relative amount of chromosome   and material present in circulating cell free dna in a maternal blood sample  sensigene fetal rhd genotyping ldt sensigene rhd test to determine the presence or absence of fetal rhesus d factor  sensigene cystic fibrosis carrier screening test sensigene cf test to help identify individuals who may have an increased risk of having certain cystic fibrosis genetic mutations  and retnagene amd age related macular degeneration ldt retnagene amd test to predict the genetic risk of a patient with dry or early stage age related macular degeneration  or amd  progressing to wet or advanced choroidal neovascular disease within   and years 
our molecular diagnostics segment grew significantly in due primarily to the rapid market adoption of the maternit plus test since its launch in october we depend upon third party payors to provide reimbursement for our tests 
accordingly  sequenom cmm has and expects to continue to focus substantial resources on obtaining reimbursement coverage from third party payors 
in december  the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists acog and the society for maternal fetal medicine specialists smfm issued a joint committee opinion on noninvasive prenatal testing for fetal aneuploidy  which supported the use of circulating cell free fetal dna as a basis for noninvasive prenatal testing in pregnant women at high risk of carrying a fetus with fetal aneuploidy 
we believe these guidelines will drive further adoption of sequenom cmm maternit plus test and strengthen our efforts to obtain insurance reimbursement 
we continue to invest in sequenom cmm diagnostic services infrastructure to support and expand its operations to effectively meet increasing demand for our laboratory developed tests 
currently  sequenom cmm performs its ldts testing services primarily as an out of network laboratory with most insurance companies 
as an out of network laboratory  sequenom cmm bills insurance companies and bills patients for deductibles and copayment amounts 
due to sequenom cmm current out of network provider status associated with the lack of existing contracts with most payors and the current level of adoption rates  we expect amounts billed will fluctuate until these factors are resolved 
sequenom cmm diagnostic testing services revenues are primarily recognized on a cash basis  until we can reliably estimate the amount that would be ultimately collected for each of its ldts 
sequenom cmm performs its ldts tests in two sites  san diego  california  for its maternit plus test  and grand rapids  michigan  for its other tests 
sequenom cmm will continue efforts to ensure that office and laboratory space is adequate to accommodate the necessary capacity requirements to meet sequenom cmm current and expanding business needs 
sequenom cmm has begun to staff its new site in raleigh durham  north carolina  which is expected to begin commercial operations performing its maternit plus test by mid subsequent to the year ended december   we entered into a lease for a new facility with an additional approximately  square feet of office space in san diego  california  into which we will relocate corporate functions to enable expansion of the san diego lab in our existing facility and expand our customer service  billing and other support functions 
we believe these expansion efforts will be enough to meet our and sequenom cmm needs for our genetic analysis segment revenues declined in  with approximately basis points of that decline due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
funding in the research market in was constrained in the beginning of the year  and some customers shifted their research to different technologies 
we have developed additional test panels for the research market to improve the utility of our instruments 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and we expect to incur additional operating losses in as we continue to expand our commercial infrastructure to serve the prenatal and ophthalmology markets  expand sequenom cmm laboratory capacity  further develop existing tests  conduct clinical studies and develop additional products and tests 
the timing of becoming profitable is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of reimbursement payments from third party payors  our and sequenom cmm costs to expand our test capacity  the timing and costs related to research and development projects  selling and marketing efforts  and administrative support to support the growing company 
our capital requirements to sustain operations have been and will continue to be significant 
in  we completed a private placement of our common stock for net proceeds of million  and issued million of senior convertible notes for net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million 
our strategic focus in will be to continue to accelerate the growth of our diagnostic testing business  grow our revenue through obtaining contracts with payors and increasing our market penetration  and growing our genetic analysis business  to create a sustainable  profitable business model for the future 
we will continue to invest in our commercial operations to expand our relationships with physicians who order our tests and in our research and development programs to develop additional or enhanced tests and additional products for sale within the genetic analysis market 
highlights for the first time  revenues from our molecular diagnostic segment  which we began to commercialize ldts in  exceed revenues from product sales and services in our genetic analysis business 
total revenues during increased million  or  to million when compared to million during diagnostic services revenues during increased million  or  to million when compared to million during genetic analysis product sales and services revenues during decreased million  or  to million when compared to million during approximately million of the decline is due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
total accessions for all sequenom cmm tests in our molecular diagnostics segment during increased  or  to  when compared to  during sequenom cmm accessioned  maternit plus tests in  the first full year since launch  and ended the year with an annual run rate exceeding  tests 
sequenom cmm expanded its maternit plus test to include trisomies and following publication of clinical study results for those aneuploidies 
we completed tenant improvements on laboratory space in raleigh durham  north carolina  where sequenom cmm plans to operate an additional site following completion of validation and certification of the laboratory operations at the site  which is expected in the first half of in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes  maturing in  in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers 
we received net proceeds of million  which we intend to use to fund sequenom cmm commercialization of its maternit plus test  as well as for other general corporate purposes  which may include research and development expenses  capital expenditures  working capital  and general and administrative expenses 
in january  we closed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share and received net proceeds of million intended for general corporate purposes  including research and development expenses  capital expenditures  working capital  and general administrative expenses 
during  we completed international distribution agreements that expand access to sequenom cmm maternit plus testing service outside the united states to foreign countries  including japan  hong kong  the czech republic  slovakia  the netherlands  and israel and licensed our technology for use in germany and certain other countries 
we introduced new research use only panels for the massarray platform in our genetic analysis business 
results of operations revenues we derive our revenues primarily from diagnostic services and product sales and services related to our genetic analysis products 
we operate our business in two segments  molecular diagnostics  which comprises our laboratory testing services business conducted by our subsidiary  sequenom cmm  and genetic analysis  which sells and services our massarray system and related products and provides contract services to our customers 
our revenues and accessions were as follows year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands change change change change diagnostic services genetic analysis product sales and services total revenues of total revenues diagnostic services genetic analysis product sales and services total change change change change total accessions for all sequenom cmm tests diagnostic services diagnostic services revenues are derived primarily from payments for providing testing services for sequenom cmm ldts and are primarily recognized on a cash basis as payments are received 
sequenom cmm will continue to account for this revenue on a cash basis until further experience and third party contracts are gained and additional internal controls are established that will allow a reasonable estimate of collectible amounts to be made before moving to the accrual method of accounting 
each test performed relates to a patient specimen collected by a health care professional  and received by the laboratory 
such specimen encounter is commonly referred to as an accession in the laboratory sector 
although accessions are not billed until the test is complete and results are reported to the ordering physicians  we believe that the number of accessions received is useful to understand the volume of sequenom cmm business 
these tests are typically completed within approximately six business days from the date of accession 
revenues for diagnostic services are generated primarily from customers located within the united states 
during  we completed international distribution agreements that expand access to sequenom cmm maternit plus testing service outside the united states 
the international customers collect and ship patient samples to the laboratory  and sequenom cmm processes the samples in its laboratory in the united states 
we also have a royalty agreement with an international customer whom we have licensed our technology to for certain countries 
during  international customers accounted for less than of our revenues 
the million  or  increase in diagnostic services revenues during  when compared to  is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of accessions during the increase in accessions during is primarily attributable to the introduction of the maternit plus test in the fourth quarter of and expansion of sequenom cmm prenatal sales force and its advisory board efforts to expand the awareness of the clinical utility of this test 
the increase in diagnostic services revenues during also reflects an increase in volume and the sales price of sequenom cmm sensigene cf test  which increased revenue by million  and increased volume of the retnagene amd test  which increased revenue by million 
the million  or  increase in diagnostic services revenues during  when compared to  is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of accessions during higher sensigene cf test accessions during and the number of tests collected during accounted for the majority of the increase in diagnostic services revenues 
the introductions of the maternit plus test and the retnagene amd test in the fourth and second quarters of  respectively  also contributed to the increase in accessions and revenues 
we believe that our diagnostic services revenues will continue to be affected by our current revenue recognition policy of generally recognizing revenue upon cash collection  the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services  the adoption rates of sequenom cmm existing ldts and any future ldts  and payment patterns of third party payors and patients 
genetic analysis product sales and services our genetic analysis product sales and services revenues were as follows year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands change change change change system sales consumables maintenance services contract research and other total genetic analysis product sales and services revenues are derived from sales of research use only consumables  including our spectrochip used with our iplex assay and other assays  massarray systems  maintenance agreements  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  and contract research services 
revenues for genetic analysis products and services are generated from customers primarily located in north america  and customers and distributors located in europe and asia 
the million  or  decrease in our genetic analysis product sales and services revenues during  when compared to  is primarily attributable to the decrease in consumables revenue orders from our customers in the translational research and agricultural biology markets  fewer massarray system placements during  the effects of foreign currency  which reduced revenues by million in  and lower contract research revenues 
the million  or  increase in our genetic analysis product sales and services revenues during  when compared to  is primarily attributable to our larger installed base of massarray systems against the comparative period 
this larger installed base contributed to an increase in consumables orders from our customers in the translational research and agricultural biology markets 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the number of massarray systems sold during our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and  we believe  will likely continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray system and consumables  general economic conditions  and the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services 
cost of revenues and gross margins cost of revenues consists of material  direct labor of our laboratory  manufacturing and service personnel  outside laboratory costs  royalties and overhead 
gross margin consists of our revenues less cost of revenues 
our costs of revenues and gross margins were as follows year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands as restated as restated change change change change cost of revenues diagnostic services genetic analysis product sales and services total gross margin diagnostic services genetic analysis product sales and services total gross margin as a of revenues diagnostic services genetic analysis product sales and services total diagnostic services cost of diagnostic services revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with accessioning patient specimens including quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport patient specimens  royalties  and license fees 
infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
costs associated with performing tests are recorded as tests are processed 
costs recorded for patient specimen processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
while license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues  the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be capped at annual minimum or maximum amounts 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
cost of diagnostic services revenues during the years presented was affected by increased test volumes and the increase in headcount and laboratory operational costs to support increased production capacity for sequenom cmm diagnostic services 
negative gross margin as a percentage of diagnostic services revenue during all three years was also affected by our current revenue recognition policy of generally recognizing revenue upon cash collection  which may result in costs being incurred in one period that relate to revenue recognized in a later period 
we expect that gross margin for our diagnostic services will continue to be affected by the adoption rates of sequenom cmm diagnostic tests  our revenue recognition policy  the levels of reimbursement  and payor and other contracts we may enter into for our tests 
we expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods to the extent we process more tests  and to expand capacity within sequenom cmm laboratory  including its additional site in raleigh durham  north carolina 
sequenom cmm currently has the physical capacity to conduct  maternit plus tests per year and plans to expand to an aggregate capacity of  tests per year by the end of the north carolina site can be expanded if  and when  additional capacity is needed 
genetic analysis product sales and services gross margin as a percentage of genetic analysis product sales and research use only services revenues remained relatively flat at during from in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of genetic analysis product sales and services revenue from during to during was due to changes in product mix  including increased consumables  which typically have higher margins  as well as higher gross margin on systems sales related to a higher average selling price and lower service costs due to improved reliability of the massarray system compared with systems sold in previous periods 
we expect that gross margin for our genetic analysis product sales and services will fluctuate on a quarterly basis and be affected by  among other things  the selling price for massarray systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of product sales and the type of services  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  sales through distributors  as well as our manufacturing costs  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required  and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of compensation and related departmental expenses for sales and marketing  customer support  and business development personnel 
year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands as restated as restated change change change change selling and marketing the million  or  increase in selling and marketing expenses during  when compared to  was primarily related to increased headcount to support our molecular diagnostics operations resulting in higher labor and related costs of million  increased facilities and other expenses of million related to the increase in headcount  increased personnel and travel expenses of million and third party marketing of million attributable to promoting the maternit plus ldt 
the million  or  increase in selling and marketing expenses during  when compared to  is primarily related to higher labor costs of million associated with the expansion of sequenom cmm laboratory  and higher travel and marketing expense of million associated with the expansion of sequenom cmm sales force and support of the maternit plus test commercialization  partially offset by lower bad debt expense of million in and lower consulting costs of million related to the elimination of a third party sales force in we expect selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods due to our efforts to increase penetration of our markets and reimbursement for our tests  continued investment in our commercial infrastructure and increases in our sales force 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consisted primarily of compensation and related personnel expenses  product development costs  quality and regulatory costs  and expenses relating to licensing costs and work performed under research and development contracts 
year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands as restated as restated change change change change research and development the million  or  decrease in research and development expenses during  when compared to  was primarily related to increased headcount to support our research and development efforts resulting in higher labor costs of million and an increase of million in facilities and other business expenses related to expansion of sequenom cmm laboratory facilities  offset by a million decrease in research related intellectual property licensing and collaboration costs and a decrease of million in clinical study costs due to completion of certain projects 
the million  or  increase in research and development expenses during when compared to is primarily related to higher labor costs of million associated with the expansion of sequenom cmm clia laboratory  including validation of the san diego location  higher supply expenses of million related to the expansion of the laboratory  higher research related intellectual property licensing and collaboration costs of million  higher overhead and depreciation expenses of million related to increased equipment  higher consulting costs of million associated with our completion of sequenom cmm clinical validation of its maternit plus test validation  partially offset by lower clinical expenses of million related to the completion of major trisomy development studies 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods due to increased investment in our product pipeline for prenatal testing  ophthalmology diseases  and other molecular diagnostic areas  along with increased investment in research use only panels and potential clinical applications of our massarray systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related departmental expenses for executive  legal  finance  information technology and human resource personnel and outside professional fees 
year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands change change change change general and administrative the million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses during  when compared to  was primarily related to increased legal costs of million  mainly associated with patent litigation  increased headcount to support our operations resulting in labor costs of million  increased third party billing costs of million due to an increase in the number diagnostic tests performed and collected  an increase in corporate  travel  and other expenses of million  and higher audit and tax fees of million associated with our increase in operations 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses during  when compared to  was primarily due to lower legal costs of million associated with decreased investigative and sec related activities  lower overhead  depreciation  and facilities expenses of million  and lower third party marketing costs of million related to non recurring market research performed in  partially offset by higher labor costs of million associated with increased headcount  higher consulting expenses of million associated with our use of third party billing providers  and higher audit and tax fees of million associated with our increase in operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business  however we expect the rate of growth to be moderate 
litigation settlement  net litigation settlement expense  net  during was million and represents  paid in cash and the issuance of million shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of million in settlement of consolidated class action securities lawsuits and payment of related plaintiffs attorneys fees 
there were no litigation settlement costs in or other income and expense and income tax year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands change change change change interest expense  net other expense income  net income tax benefit expense interest expense  net the increase in interest expense  net  during is attributable to the issuance of our senior convertible notes and higher outstanding balances on our term loan during  partially offset by an increase in interest income in due to the increase in investment securities held during following completion of financing activities 
the increase in interest expense  net  during as compared to is attributable to borrowings on our term loan and lower cash and investment balances during other expense income  net other expense  net  during primarily relates to the write off of the cumulative translation loss as a result of the liquidation of our investment in our u 
k subsidiary upon its dissolution 
other income  net  during includes the receipt of a research and development grant from the us government of  landlord reimbursements related to property loss of  and net gains on marketable securities of  other income  net  during includes the receipt of a research and development grant from the us government of income tax benefit expense in  we recorded a benefit of million for the realization of research and development credits taken on prior year tax returns  which we believe are more likely than not sustainable upon examination 
the provision for income taxes in is primarily due to statutory tax liabilities resulting from our state and foreign operations 
segment results segment performance assessment is based on revenue and operating income loss exclusive of certain unallocated costs  including corporate general and administrative expenses  litigation expense  other indirect costs  and certain other costs  which are not allocated to our segments for performance assessment by our chief operating decision maker 
unallocated operating expenses excluded from our segments for performance assessment represent expenses that do not reflect  according to criteria established by us  operating expenses associated with our reportable segment activities 
no allocation of resources is done by our chief operating decision maker in consideration of discrete segment assets and we do not discretely allocate assets to our operating segments 
intersegment revenues and transfers are immaterial 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies 
in the third quarter of  we changed the allocation of certain costs in our management reporting structure to allocate the costs of facilities  information technology  patient billing  and stock based compensation to the respective segments 
for comparability  we have reclassified prior period segment operating income loss to reflect these changes adopted during these reclassifications only affect our segment reporting  and do not change our total consolidated revenues  operating loss  or net loss or our total segment revenues or total segment financial results 
the following table sets forth our revenues and operating income loss from our molecular diagnostics and genetic analysis segments year over year increase decrease years ended december  from from dollars in thousands as restated as restated change change change change revenues molecular diagnostic genetic analysis product sales and services total revenues operating income loss molecular diagnostic genetic analysis product sales and services unallocated total molecular diagnostics operating losses for molecular diagnostics during the years presented increased due primarily to the increase in headcount and expansion of facilities to support our diagnostic services operations 
sequenom cmm introduced new ldts during and significantly expanded its commercial sales force to drive adoption of its ldts 
sequenom cmm is continuing its efforts to obtain reimbursement for all of its tests  however many payors initially denied coverage for the maternit plus test as they considered the test investigational and experimental  despite sequenom cmm published study 
we recognize revenue primarily on a cash basis  however we record costs to perform the tests as those costs are incurred 
laboratory operating costs have increased as the number of tests processed significantly increased in selling and marketing costs increased by million due to the increase in the field sales force personnel dedicated to the prenatal and ophthalmology markets to drive adoption of the ldts 
genetic analysis operating income for genetic analysis decreased during as compared to due to a lower gross margin of million plus an increase in research and development expenses of million in our genetic analysis business 
the increase in operating income in as compared to relates directly to the increased gross margin 
unallocated unallocated costs were higher in than in  due primarily to additional legal expenses of million and additional labor costs of million due to increased headcount to support operations  partially offset by the higher costs in related to the nonrecurring license fees paid to cuhk and value of the warrant issued to cuhk aggregating million 
liquidity and capital resources we have a history of recurring losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including commercialization of sequenom cmm ldts  research and development projects  and litigation have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december  and december   we had working capital of million and million  respectively 
we consider the material drivers of our cash flow to be testing volumes and collections of billed tests for our diagnostic testing services  sales volumes of our genetic analysis products and services  working capital  inventory management  and operating expenses 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  collections for our commercialized tests and product sales and services  and million available at december  under our revolving line of credit facility 
we have also financed our operating and capital requirements during the last three years with proceeds from the issuance of our senior convertible notes and the public offering of our common stock during and the public and private offerings of our common stock during we are continuing to expand the operations of sequenom cmm following commercialization of the maternit plus ldt  including research and development activities related to improvements to current tests and expansion of sequenom cmm diagnostic testing menu 
sequenom cmm plans to further expand its marketing and sales capabilities in order to increase demand for the maternit plus ldt and other tests  to expand geographically  and to successfully commercialize any other ldts it may develop 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and current marketable securities totaled million  compared to million at december  the increase is due primarily to net proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior convertible notes and the public offering of our common stock  which was partially offset by our cash used in operating activities and purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements of million and million  respectively 
our cash equivalents and current marketable securities are held in a variety of securities that that include us government treasuries  certificates of deposits  and money market funds that have ratings of aa  or are fully guaranteed by the us government  and mutual funds 
at our current and anticipated level of operating loss  we expect to continue to incur net operating cash outflows until reimbursement for our tests is established with the majority of third party payors 
we expect that our december  balances of cash and marketable equity securities are sufficient to provide for our operating needs through at least the end of operating activities cash used in operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december  our use of cash was primarily a result of the net loss of million during compared to million for changes in operating assets and liabilities during provided net cash of million and resulted primarily from higher accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities of million during  primarily reflects purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements of million and other assets of million  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities net of purchases of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during  compared to million during financing activities during include net proceeds of million from our issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes  net proceeds of million from our public offering  proceeds from drawing on our term loan of million  and million from the exercise of stock options and employee contributions under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by payments on debt obligations of million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term obligations operating leases research and development collaboration and licensing agreements purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term obligations include our senior convertible notes  which are convertible at any time prior to the third trading day immediately preceding their maturity date in october  at the option of the holders  into shares of our common stock at specified conversion rates  our bank loans due may  and our obligation for building and improvements recorded in connection with our north carolina location 
research and development collaboration and licensing agreements primarily consist of minimum required payments for royalties and contract maintenance fees under agreements with institutions to conduct sponsored research and clinical study agreements 
the expected timing of payments included in the table above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payment and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of services and or achievement of milestones 
purchase obligations are those that are unconditional and have a remaining term in excess of one year 
in january  we entered into a lease for office space that expires in july minimum future annual obligations under this lease total million  which is not included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing our financial statements  we make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management considers relevant 
because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
diagnostic services revenues earned by sequenom cmm have been primarily recognized on a cash basis due to the lack of contractual reimbursement agreements with third party payors for a significant portion of its testing services and limited collections experience 
sequenom cmm generally bills third party payors upon generation and delivery of a test result to the ordering physician following completion of a test 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and risk of collection with the third party payor 
patients have out of pocket costs for amounts not covered by their insurance carrier and sequenom cmm bills the patient directly for these amounts in the form of co pays and deductibles in accordance with their insurance carrier and health plans 
some payors may not cover the test as ordered by the physician under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  sequenom cmm pursues reimbursement on a case by case basis 
we will recognize diagnostic services revenues upon cash collection until we can reliably estimate the amount that would be ultimately collected for each of sequenom cmm ldts 
we record revenue and accounts receivable for billing directly to physician offices and international customers where we believe collectability is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we receive requests for refunds of payments  generally due to over payments made by third party payors 
upon becoming aware of a refund request  we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until we determine the amounts upon which a refund is due 
accrued refunds were  at december revenues from sales of our massarray systems and consumables are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer and when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer 
we recognize revenues on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
royalty revenues are generally recorded on an accrual basis 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in various types of securities  including money market funds  us treasury securities and certificates of deposit 
in accordance with accounting standards for fair value measurements  we classify our investments as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs  which utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  the level of judgment required to estimate fair value is relatively low 
we value our investments in money market funds  us treasury securities and mutual funds using level inputs 
fair values determined by level inputs  which utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves and fair values determined by level inputs  which utilize unobservable data points support by little or no market activities  require the exercise of judgment and use of estimates  that if changed  could significantly affect our statement of financial position and results of operations 
we value our investments in certificates of deposit using level inputs 
we do not have any level investments at december  or at december   million of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as level assets 
these securities are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued and reported utilizing fair values provided by our investment managers who estimate the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly  such as quotes from multiple third party pricing vendors  fund or trust companies and quoted prices for securities with similar maturity and rating features 
we perform additional procedures to corroborate the fair value of our securities  including the comparison of fair values provided by our investment managers to those obtained from other reliable sources 
accounts receivable sequenom cmm bills third party payors for its ldts upon delivery of test results to ordering physicians and we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with these payors 
we do not record accounts receivable for billings to third party payors or self pay patients as these revenues are currently recognized on a cash basis 
for billings directly to physician offices or to international clients where collectability is reasonably assured  we recognize revenue on an accrual basis 
we invoice our genetic analysis product sales and services as orders are shipped and or services provided and any other contractual obligations are met 
our contracts typically require payment within to days of the date of invoice 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  client credit  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles  including expiration 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments made to employees  directors  and consultants based on estimated fair value  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
these stock based awards include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchase rights using the black scholes merton  or bsm  option pricing model  which requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value employee stock based compensation at the date of grant 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards and units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
stock based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise the estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
research and development expenses we enter into collaboration and clinical study agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  may vary from contract to contract  and may result in uneven payment flows 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical development personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services provided and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
north carolina lease because the terms of the company facility lease agreements for its north carolina laboratory site required the company extensive involvement in the construction of the building  the company is deemed to be the owner of the building for accounting purposes only 
accordingly  the company recorded assets of million  representing the fair value of the building based on the assessed value and the total costs of the improvements  including the costs paid by the lessor the legal owner of the building  with an associated long term obligation 
upon completion of construction of the building  the company did not meet the sale leaseback criteria for de recognition of the building assets and obligation 
therefore  the lease is accounted for as a long term financing obligation 
at the end of the lease term  including exercise of any renewal options  the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed assets will be recognized as a non cash gain on sale of the property 
we report rent expense only on the land portion of the property but not for the building which is owned for accounting purposes 
rather  building rental payments under the lease are recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and interest expense 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance requires an entity to present items of net income and other comprehensive income  or oci  and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but continuous statements 
we are no longer allowed to present oci in the statement of stockholders equity 
earnings per share will continue to be based on net income 
the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk our current investment policy requires us to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities that are represented by issuances from the us government  repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities that have ratings of aa  or are fully guaranteed by the us government 
our investment policy also includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments and the overall amount that may be invested with a single security 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
the appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
based on this determination  as of december  and  all of our investments in marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were reported at fair value 
we measure fair value based on the prices that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness  credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to operations and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we use the specific identification method of determining the cost basis in computing realized and unrealized gains and losses on the sale of our available for sale securities 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and marketable securities  all of which are reported at their fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of these assets at december   as the assets consisted of highly liquid securities with short term maturities 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign operations whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp  the japanese yen yen  and the euro eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the united states dollar usd using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
additionally  we occasionally invoice australian customers in their local currency 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the usd 
a movement of in the usd to australian dollars aud exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of  a movement of in the usd dollar to eur exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of  we do not believe that a movement in the exchange rate between the usd and the gbp  the yen  or any other foreign currencies  to which we are exposed  respectively  would have a material impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the period covered 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
