with our data as a foundation  we have built strong analytics capabilities and a variety of value added business services to meet our customers needs for mortgage and automotive credit reporting  property tax  property valuation  flood plain location determination and other geospatial data  data  analytics and related services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in note significant accounting policies 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingencies 
our assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time we prepare the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  we cannot determine future events 
as a result  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
our operating results for the years ended december   and include results for any acquired entities from the applicable acquisition date forward and all prior periods have been adjusted to properly reflect discontinued operations 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues principally from us mortgage originators and servicers with good creditworthiness 
our product and service deliverables are generally comprised of data or other related services 
our revenue arrangements with our customers generally include a work order or written agreement specifying the data products or services to be delivered and related terms of sale including payment amounts and terms 
the primary revenue recognition related judgments we exercise are to determine when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products or services where delivery occurs at a point in time  we recognize revenue upon delivery 
these products or services include sales of tenancy data and analytics  credit solutions for mortgage and automotive industries  under banked credit services  flood and data services  real estate owned asset management  claims management  asset management and processing solutions  broker price opinions  and field services where we perform property preservation services 
for products or services where delivery occurs over time  we recognize revenue ratably on a subscription basis over the contractual service period once initial delivery has occurred 
generally these service periods range from one to three years 
products or services recognized on a license or subscription basis include information and analytic products  flood database licenses  realtor solutions  and lending solutions 
tax service revenues are comprised of periodic loan fees and life of loan fees 
for periodic loans  we generate monthly fees at a contracted fixed rate for as long as we service the loan 
loans serviced with a one time  life of loan fee are billed once the loan is boarded to our tax servicing system in accordance with a customer tax servicing agreement 
life of loan fees are then deferred and recognized ratably over the expected service period 
the rates applied to recognize revenues assume a year contract life and are adjusted to reflect prepayments 
we review the tax service contract portfolio quarterly to determine if there have been changes in contract lives  deferred on boarding costs  expected service period  and or changes in the number and or timing of prepayments 
accordingly  we may adjust the rates to reflect current trends 
cost of services 
cost of services represents costs incurred in the creation and delivery of our products and services 
cost of services consists primarily of data acquisition and royalty fees  customer service costs  which include personnel costs to collect  maintain and update our proprietary databases  to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support  hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing 
table of contents systems  telecommunication and computer network expense  and occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed by employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs  direct and indirect selling costs  restructuring costs  corporate costs  fees for professional and consulting services  advertising costs  uncollectible accounts and other costs of administration such as marketing  human resources  finance and administrative roles 
purchase accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires companies to assign values to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their fair values 
in most instances there is not a readily defined or listed market price for individual assets and liabilities acquired in connection with a business  including intangible assets 
the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities in many instances requires a high degree of estimation 
the valuation of intangible assets  in particular  is very subjective 
we generally obtain third party valuations to assist us in estimating fair values 
the use of different valuation techniques and assumptions could change the amounts and useful lives assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired  including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and related amortization expense 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for each reporting unit every fourth quarter 
in addition to our annual impairment test  we periodically assess whether events or circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the overall carrying value of our goodwill and other intangibles  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following cost factors  financial performance  legal and regulatory factors  entity specific events  industry and market factors  macroeconomic conditions and other considerations 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then management s impairment testing process may include two additional steps 
the first step step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined by using discounted cash flow analysis and market approach valuations 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  then goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is required 
however  if the book value is greater than the fair value  a second step step must be completed to determine if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the book value of the goodwill 
step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
the valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue growth  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates 
forecasts of future operations are based  in part  on operating results and our expectations as to future market conditions 
these types of analysis contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgments to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an additional impairment loss that could be material 
these tests utilize a variety of valuation techniques  all of which require us to make estimates and judgments 
fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique  which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and an appropriate discount rate 
the use of comparative market multiples the market approach compares the reporting unit to other comparable companies if such comparables are present in the marketplace based on valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value 
we also use certain of these valuation techniques in accounting for business combinations  primarily in the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
in assessing the fair value  we utilize the results of the valuations including the market approach to the extent comparables are available and consider the range of fair values determined under all methods and the extent to which the fair value exceeds the book value of the equity 
as of december   our reporting units are data and analytics  mortgage origination services  and asset management and processing solutions 

table of contents in connection with our acquisition of cds business mapping  llc cds  we separated our spatial solutions business line from our mortgage origination services segment and consolidated it with cds  effectively creating the geospatial solutions business unit within the data and analytics segment 
as a result  we revised our reporting for segment disclosure purposes and reassessed our reporting units for purposes of evaluating the carrying value of our goodwill 
this assessment required us to perform a fourth quarter reassignment of our goodwill to each reporting unit impacted using the relative fair value approach  based on the fair values of the reporting units as of december  determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage origination services reporting unit and geospatial solutions business unit in our testing were a expected cash flow for the period from to  and b a discount rate ranging from to  which was based on management best estimate of the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
we performed a qualitative analysis on our reporting units and examined relevant events and circumstances such as cost factors  financial performance  legal and regulatory factors  entity specific events  industry and market factors  macroeconomic conditions and other considerations 
we also considered the reassignment analysis of geospatial solutions goodwill to each reporting unit impacted using the relative fair value approach 
based on the qualitative analysis performed  we determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill attributable to our reporting units is not impaired as of december  it is reasonably possible that changes in the facts  judgments  assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of the goodwill could cause a reporting unit to become impaired 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
we recognize in income the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not 
we reflect changes in recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions in the period in which a change in judgment occurs 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance based upon expected levels of taxable income  future reversals of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and recent financial operations 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to estimate the useful lives of several asset classes  including capitalized data  internally developed software and other intangible assets 
the estimation of useful lives requires a significant amount of judgment related to matters such as future changes in technology  legal issues related to allowable uses of data and other matters 
stock based compensation 
we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
we used the binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value for any options granted after december  through december  for the options granted in  and  we used the black scholes model to estimate the fair value 
we utilize the straight line single option method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense unless another expense attribution model is required 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the results of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we apply the long form method for determining the pool of windfall tax benefits 
currently  our primary means of stock based compensation is granting restricted stock units rsus 
the fair value of any rsu grant is based on the market value of our shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
rsus granted to certain key employees have graded vesting and have a service and performance requirement  and are therefore expensed using the accelerated multiple option method to record stock based 
table of contents compensation expense 
all other rsu awards have graded vesting and service is the only requirement to vest in the award  and are therefore generally expensed using the straight line single option method to record stock based compensation expense 
in addition to stock options and rsus  through september we had an employee stock purchase plan that allowed eligible employees to purchase common stock of the company at of the closing price on the last day of each quarter 
we recognized an expense in the amount equal to the discount 
the employee stock purchase plan expired in september our employee stock purchase plan was approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders and the first offering period commenced in october reclassifications 
prior to the separation  we operated primarily as a title insurance company regulated under article of regulation s x and were not subject to the requirements of article of regulation s x 
rule of regulation s x requires article companies  such as us  to classify expenses in a functional manner 
we have reclassified external cost of revenues  salaries and benefits and other operating expenses into cost of services and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  in our income statement within our annual report on form k for the years ended december   and the reclassification of these expenses on a functional basis was not material to the financial statements as a whole  as it had no impact to operating revenues  total operating expenses  operating income  net income or earnings per share previously reported 
in addition  there was no impact on our balance sheets or statements of cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance related to the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset other than goodwill is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the updated guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december and january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to the presentation of offsetting netting assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the guidance requires the disclosure of both gross information and net information on instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the updated guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

results of operations overview we generate the majority of our revenues from clients with operations in the us residential real estate  mortgage origination and mortgage servicing markets 
we believe the volume of real estate transactions is primarily affected by real estate prices  the availability of funds for mortgage loans  mortgage interest rates  employment levels and the overall state of the us economy 
throughout we benefited from the improvement in the us residential real estate and mortgage lending industries  particularly from higher refinancing transactions  which resulted in higher levels of mortgage applications and originations 
this  combined with recovering home prices and home purchase activity  created an improved market environment for our businesses in approximately of our operating revenues for the year ended december  were generated from the ten largest united states mortgage originators 
based on statistics published by the mortgage bankers association mba and data from significant mortgage originators  we estimate that total mortgage originations increased approximately in relative to the same period of mba estimates that mortgage applications increased in relative to the same period of given that many of our origination related products and services are provided early in the origination cycle  application volumes are a leading indicator of demand for these products and services 
in  the level of mortgage originations  particularly refinancing transactions  were relatively high due to historical lows in long term interest rates  the accommodative policy stance of the federal reserve  and the presence of federal government programs targeting mortgage loan refinancing and modification activity 
we anticipate the level of mortgage originations to modestly decline in the near term 
based on our internal estimates  the level of loans seriously delinquent loans delinquent days or more or in foreclosure decreased approximately in the year ended december  relative to the same period of additionally  based on our internal analysis and market estimates  we believe the inventory of seriously delinquent mortgage loans and loans in foreclosure will continue to decline

liquidity and capital strategy we believe that cash flow from operations and current cash balances  together with currently available lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements through the next twelve months 
cash available from operations could be affected by any general economic downturn or any decline or adverse changes in the company business such as a loss of customers  competitive pressures or other significant change in business environment 
the company strives to pursue a balanced approach to capital allocation and will consider the repurchase of common shares and the retirement of outstanding debt  and will pursue strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis 
availability of additional capital our access to additional capital fluctuates as market conditions change 
there may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices  in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources 
based on current market conditions and our financial condition including our ability to satisfy the conditions contained in our debt instruments that are required to be satisfied to permit us to incur additional indebtedness  we believe that we have the ability to effectively access these liquidity sources for new borrowings 
however  a weakening of our financial condition  including a significant decrease in our profitability or cash flows or a material increase in our leverage  could adversely affect our ability to access these markets and or increase our cost of borrowings
