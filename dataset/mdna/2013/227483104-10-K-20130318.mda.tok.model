item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are a leader in healthcare staffing with a primary focus on providing nurse  allied and physician locum tenens staffing services and workforce solutions to the healthcare market 
we believe we are one of the top two providers of nurse and allied staffing services  one of the top four providers of temporary physician staffing locum tenens services  and one of the top five providers of retained physician and healthcare executive search services 
we are also a leading provider of education and training programs specifically for the healthcare marketplace 
we report our financial results according to three business segments nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  and other human capital management services 
we have a diversified revenue mix across healthcare customers 
for the year ended december   our nurse and allied staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel nurse and per diem nurse staffing  and allied health staffing 
travel nurse staffing represented approximately of our total revenue and of our nurse and allied staffing business segment revenue 
other nurse and allied staffing services include the placement of per diem nurses and allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists  nurse practitioners and respiratory therapists 
our physician staffing business segment represented approximately of revenue and consists of temporary physician staffing services locum tenens 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to sell our clinical trial services business segment as a result of an extensive review of our business and the changing competitive landscape in the pharmaceutical outsourcing industry 
this segment consisted of service offerings that include traditional contract staffing and functional outsourcing  as well as drug safety monitoring and regulatory services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers 
as of december   our clinical trial services segment is classified as a disposal group held for sale and the results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the long term macro drivers of our business are demographic in nature and consist of a growing and aging us population demanding more healthcare services and an aging workforce of healthcare professionals 
additionally  there are projected shortages of healthcare professionals including registered nurses rns and physicians 
we believe demand for our nurse  allied and physician staffing services is primarily influenced by two factors national labor market dynamics that affect the number of hours worked by healthcare professionals  especially nurses  and the strength or weakness in acute care hospital admissions relative to expectations and the volume of patients at medical facilities and physician offices 
during  demand substantially improved for our nurse and allied staffing services and improved for our physician staffing services 
however  overall demand for our healthcare staffing services remains somewhat reduced from levels prior to the economic downturn that began in the fall of the supply of healthcare professionals in the marketplace is dependent upon the number of rns and physicians entering their respective professions versus retiring from the workforce 
the supply of rns available for our staffing services is variable and influenced by current labor market dynamics  as well as dependent upon the desire of rns to work temporary assignments versus being directly employed by hospitals as staff nurses or working in non hospital settings such as insurance companies  health clinics and doctor offices 
the supply of physicians available for our physician staffing services is variable and is influenced by several factors  including the desire of physicians to work temporary assignments versus being in private practice or directly employed at healthcare facilities  the desire of older physicians to work fewer hours  work lifestyle balance among younger physicians  and the trend toward more female physicians in the workforce working fewer hours than their male counterparts 
for the year ended december   our revenue from continuing operations was million  and we had a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  which included a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of of million million after tax or per diluted share  related to the nurse and allied staffing business segment 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and reduced our total debt by million 
we ended the year with total debt of million and million of cash  resulting in a ratio of debt  net of cash  to total capitalization of for the year ended december   discontinued operations  net of income taxes were a loss of million 
discontinued operations includes non cash goodwill and trademark impairment charges of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to this business segment 
in general  we evaluate our financial condition and operating results by revenue  contribution income see segment information  and net income loss 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes  days filled and price 
nurse and allied staffing our nurse and allied staffing services business segment is headquartered in boca raton  florida 
we operate our staffing business through a relatively centralized business model servicing all of the assignment needs of our field employees and client facilities through operation centers located in boca raton  florida  malden  massachusetts  tampa  florida  newtown square  pennsylvania  and norcross  georgia 
in addition to the key sales and recruitment activities  these centers also perform support activities such as coordinating housing  payroll processing  benefits administration  billing and collections  travel reimbursement processing  customer service and risk management 
our per diem staffing services are provided through a network of branch offices serving major metropolitan markets predominantly located on the east and west coasts of the us our nurse and allied staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of nurses and demand for our contract staffing services at healthcare facilities 
demand for our healthcare staffing services is primarily influenced by the strength or weakness of national acute care hospital admissions relative to expectations and the volume of patients at other medical facilities  as well as labor market dynamics that influence the number of hours worked by healthcare professionals 
we believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population  along with the anticipated increases in utilization of healthcare services resulting from the affordable care act  and an increasing shortage of nurses 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals could limit our ability to fill open orders and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
we market our nurse and allied staffing services primarily to acute care hospitals and health systems  and provide our clients with staffing solutions through our cross country staffing ccs and allied health group brands 
our clients provide health and medical services across a broad range of clinical settings in the for profit and not for profit sectors throughout the us  including acute care hospitals  physician practice groups  skilled nursing facilities  nursing homes and sports medicine clinics  and  to a lesser degree  and non clinical settings such as home care and schools 
ccs is our largest brand 
the vast majority of our activities are designed to help a diverse customer base of hospitals and health system clients meet their ongoing staffing needs for temporary nurses and allied health professionals 
during  we worked with more than a thousand hospitals and health system clients 
additionally  as a part of its business strategy  ccs provides comprehensive managed service provider msp solutions to large hospitals and health systems throughout the us to manage their temporary clinical staffing 
these msp contracts are specifically tailored to each client based on their workforce goals and financial targets 
our msp engagements typically incorporate one or more of our contract nurse  contract allied and or per diem staffing solutions 
typically  such arrangements require ccs to negotiate contracts with subcontractors in order to help meet the client s fill rate expectations  verify that all nurses provided both by ccs and subcontractors meet ccs credential requirements and other standards and testing requirements established by the client  verify insurance coverage of the subcontractors and their candidates  manage orders for open positions from the client and distribute those needs to subcontractors as required  interview candidates presented to ensure they meet the client s specifications  consolidate and reconcile the timecard approval and invoicing process for services provided by ccs and all subcontractors  distribute payments to subcontractors for services provided to the client  and capture and analyze data for the benefit of the client 
these services are particularly beneficial to larger facilities and systems that require many healthcare professionals across a broad spectrum of medical disciplines and specialties 
for the full year  approximately of our nurse and allied staffing volume was at msp client facilities 
in addition to directly supplying a large majority of client needs under these msp programs  ccs has relationships with hundreds of subcontractors throughout the us to ensure that clients have access to a large pool of candidates to meet their staffing needs 
another component of our business is contract staffing for hospitals and health systems undergoing electronic medical record emr technology implementations 
in these situations  we supply contract temporary healthcare professionals to provide patient care while hospital staff rns are away in classroom settings undergoing training and to provide support to the staff rns in utilizing the emr technology upon their return to bedside care 
we expect that staffing related to emr technology implementations will be one of the growth drivers of our nurse and allied staffing segment in during  while hospital admission trends continued to remain relatively flat and the us economy achieved a slight improvement and national unemployment improved somewhat but remained high  we experienced an increase in demand for our nurse and allied staffing services that strengthened over the course of the year from a very weak start 
the improvement in demand was broad based and reflected staffing associated with hospital electronic medical record implementations and staffing needs at our msp accounts 
in  over ten thousand healthcare professionals applied with us through our recruitment brands 
historically  high national unemployment typically results in rns increasingly seeking employment as hospital staff nurses and those already employed as staff nurses become more willing to work more hours at prevailing wages  which combine to reduce the need for our outsourced staffing services 
the reverse begins to occur as the economy and more specifically the labor markets improve  although there is a lag between the improvement in demand for our nurse and allied staffing services and the improvement in supply of rns and other healthcare professionals 
typically  as admissions increase for our hospital customers  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their staff employees 
in general  we evaluate the nurse and allied staffing business segment s financial condition and operating results by revenue and contribution income see segment information 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of open orders  contract bookings  number of ftes and bill rate per hour of service provided 
physician staffing we added the physician staffing business segment in with the acquisition of mda holdings  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  mda as described in the acquisitions section  that follows 
mda is headquartered in norcross  georgia and offers multi specialty locum tenens temporary physician staffing services to the healthcare industry in all states 
our physician staffing business revenue and earnings are impacted by the demand for temporary physician staffing services and the supply of qualified physicians 
when there are not enough physicians to fill the number of vacancies at hospitals  practice groups or other healthcare facilities  demand increases for our services 
in general  we believe that in periods when physicians are looking for more flexibility  have concerns with cost and availability of malpractice insurance  or want to avoid managing a practice  supply increases 
in periods where the physicians are looking for more stability  supply decreases 
demand and supply constraints may vary based on the specialty of the physician 
we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators for each specialty area of this business  such as physician staffing days filled and revenue per days filled 
in addition  we monitor this segment s revenue  contribution income and contribution income as a percentage of revenue 
during  our physician staffing revenue grew from the prior year in a marketplace that reflected a modest improvement in the economy and continuing concerns by hospital administrators and practice group leaders with respect to changes in the delivery of health care under the patient protection and affordable care act 
given these ongoing uncertainties  physicians have increasingly opted to become employees of hospitals and health care systems 
while we expect this trend to continue in the short term  we believe the future outlook for the physician staffing industry is positive as demand for physicians is projected to increase by due to the demographics of a growing and aging population along with healthcare reform that is expected to be directionally favorable to our business 
the needs will be particularly strong in the primary care specialties due to recent decreases in medical school graduates entering the primary care field 
locum tenens should benefit from these shortage trends and demands particularly with an ever increasing aging population and the anticipated increase in utilization of healthcare services 
mda is well positioned to respond to the current and future needs of its healthcare partners 
other human capital management services education and training services our cross country education cce subsidiary  headquartered in brentwood  tennessee  provides regulatory and clinical skill based continuing education development for healthcare professionals 
cce is an approved provider of continuing education with more than professional healthcare associations  and also works with national and state boards and associations 
cce coordinates with various independent contractors in order to offer one day seminars  conferences and elearning to healthcare professionals on topics pertaining to healthcare 
since  cce has trained over  licensed professionals in the fields of physical and occupational therapy  behavioral health  nursing  long term care  coding and billing  regulatory compliance  dentistry  health information and healthcare administration 
in  cce held approximately  seminars and conferences that were attended by more than  registrants in cities in the us and canada 
we extend these educational services to our field employees on favorable terms as a recruitment and retention tool 
in  cce s live seminar attendance decreased approximately from the prior year due to what we believe are several factors 
first  significant budget cuts to both non medicaid and medicaid based mental health services negatively impacted employment for public mental health programs 
we believe this reduced demand for our programs as these professionals may have obtained to a greater degree continuing education credits via e learning offerings 
second  the education industry is increasingly offering live webcasting and rebroadcasting of seminars 
to address this shift  cce has significantly expanded its offerings in this area while continuing to provide thousands of live seminars each year 
cce is also expanding its online presence and will continue to move toward a greater offering of blended learning opportunities for professionals that combine live seminar offerings with audio and e learning products 
cce is also focusing greater efforts on developing strategic partnerships with provider organizations that can extend our learning programs to their licensed employees 
retained search our cejka search subsidiary is headquartered in creve coeur  missouri  a business district centered within the st 
louis metropolitan area 
cejka search has been a leading physician  executive  advanced practice and allied health search firm for more than years  recruiting top healthcare talent for organizations nationwide through a team of experienced professionals  advanced use of recruitment technology and commitment to service excellence 
serving clients nationwide  cejka search annually completes hundreds of search assignments for organizations spanning the continuum of healthcare  including physician group practices  hospitals and health systems  academic medical centers  accountable care organizations acos  managed care and other healthcare organizations 
in  ongoing uncertainty about health care reform  medicare reimbursement rules and the pace of economic recovery continued to limit or delay implementation of the industry s medical staff and administrative leadership recruitment plans  which extended the challenging and competitive environment for retained search services 
despite these market conditions  cejka search experienced improved year over year growth in revenue and contribution income  particularly in the second half of the year  due to strong performance in executive search  the implementation of strategies to expand market reach and improve operating efficiency 
we believe cejka search is well positioned to benefit from further economic recovery  the intensifying shortage of physicians and midlevel providers  and the critical need for effective healthcare executive leadership  in particular physician executive leaders  to meet the challenges of health care reform

we determined that the fair value of our nurse and allied staffing segment was lower than the respective carrying value 
the decrease in value was due to slower than expected booking momentum and reduced contribution income in our second quarter of which lowered the anticipated growth trend used for goodwill impairment testing 
pursuant to the second step of the interim impairment testing we were required to calculate an implied fair value of goodwill based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
based on these results  we determined a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million

contribution income from our physician staffing segment for the year ended december   decreased million or to million compared to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of physician staffing revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a change in specialty mix resulting in higher physician expense as a percentage of revenue  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a portion of the aforementioned increase in our accrual for sales and other state non income taxes  and lower permanent placement revenue 
partially offsetting these decreases were lower professional liability expenses as a percentage of revenue in this segment in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   based on better than expected loss development 
contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million  from million in the year ended december  due to a decrease in contribution income from the education and training business  partially offset by an increase in contribution income from our retained search businesses 
contribution income as a percentage of other human capital management services revenue was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended december   totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  impairment charges impairment charges of million in the year ended december  resulted from the impact lower locum tenens usage had on our long term revenue forecast 
thus  our calculation of estimated fair value using the projected revenue stream indicated the carrying amount of the trademarks acquired with the mda acquisition in september might not have been fully recoverable 
based on these circumstances  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge  of which million related to our physician staffing segment and million related to our nurse and allied staffing segment 
see critical accounting principles and estimates and our consolidated financial statements note goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  for more information 
foreign exchange gain loss foreign exchange gains of million were realized in the period ended december   compared to million of losses realized in the year ended december  foreign currency gains and losses are realized upon the settlement of cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
interest expense interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  lower interest expense was due to a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings and lower average borrowings in the year ended december  the effective interest rate on our borrowings for the year ended december   was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective interest rate on our borrowings was primarily a result of the expiration of interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of interest expense in the year ended december  included an estimate of million ineffectiveness on our interest rate swaps caused by significant prepayments on our term loan borrowings 
see note interest rate swap agreements in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our interest rate swap agreements 
other expense income  net other expense income  net includes interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term cash investments  and other income and expense 
during the year ended december  and  other expense income  net is primarily interest income  and was million and million  respectively 
income tax benefit expense income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the higher effective tax rate in the year ended december  was partly due to an adjustment of million to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of related to an overstatement of deferred tax assets in prior periods 
excluding this adjustment  the effective tax rate was in the year ended december  the lower effective tax rate in the year ended december  resulted from the impact of the deferred tax benefit on impairment charges of million 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes includes the results from our clinical trial services business segment which was reclassified as discontinued in our fourth quarter of the clinical trial service business had income from operations before income taxes of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  see note assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
transactions with related parties we provide services to hospitals which are affiliated with certain board of director members 
revenue related to these transactions amounted to approximately million  million and million in aggregate for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounts receivable due from these hospitals at december  and were approximately million in aggregate 
pricing for our services is consistent with our other hospital customers 
in the year ended december   we entered into an exclusive msp arrangement with one of the hospital systems 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a current ratio  defined as the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital increased by million to million as of december   compared to million as of december   due to the reclassification of clinical trial services business segment as assets held for sale 
days sales outstanding including discontinued operations increased by day to days as of december   compared to days at december   consistent with historical ranges 
our operating cash flows constitute our primary source of liquidity  and historically  have been sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service including our commitments as described in the commitments table which follows 
we believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months 
we expect to meet our future needs for working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service from a combination of operating cash flows and funds available through the revolving loan portion of our current credit agreement 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that may require additional funding 
the modification to our credit agreement see credit agreement section which follows reduced our available incremental borrowing capacity to approximately million  thus reducing our liquidity 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  in order to increase our liquidity we repatriated cash from foreign subsidiaries of approximately million including a one time distribution from our indian subsidiary 
a foreign tax impact relating to these repatriations of approximately million has been reflected in our full year tax rate 
there was no us tax impact of these repatriations

cash flow comparisons year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to lower profitability and timing of income tax payments and receipts in year ended december  during the year ended december  we received million in income tax refunds  primarily due to the utilization of a net operating loss carryback 
investing activities provided million in the year ended december  compared to million used in the year ended december  we used million and million  respectively for capital expenditures during the years ended december  and in addition  other investing activities provided million in year ended december  related to the liquidation of our foreign long term and short term cash investments

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable in the year ended december  compared to a decrease in accounts receivable in the year ended december  the increase in accounts receivable in the year ended december  is reflective of the increase in revenue we have experienced in during the year ended december  we experienced sequential declines in revenue with relatively similar days sales outstanding

commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table reflects our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  commitments total thereafter unaudited  amounts in thousands senior secured credit facility a capital lease obligations operating leases obligations b purchase obligations c a under our credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants 
our inability to comply with the required covenants or other provisions could result in default under our credit facility

b represents future minimum lease payments associated with operating lease agreements with original terms of more than one year 
c other contractual obligations include contracts for information systems consulting services 
in addition to the above disclosed contractual obligations  we have accrued uncertain tax positions  pursuant to the income taxes topic of the fasb asc of million at december  based on the uncertainties associated with the settlement of these items  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of potential settlements  if any  with the taxing authorities 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  taxes and other contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through december  in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment review policy in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc  we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  in our fourth quarter  for impairment at the reporting unit level and whenever circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
we evaluated four reporting units nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  retained search  and education and training 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of inputs including level inputs such as discounted cash flows which are not observable from the market  directly or indirectly  as well as inputs such as pricing multiples from publicly traded guideline companies and our market capitalization 
the first step in the impairment assessment requires us to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
generally  we estimate the fair value based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach blended fair value for each of our reporting units 
first quarter interim impairment testing results at the end of the first quarter of  our stock price declined from december  in addition  a slowdown in demand and booking activity in our nurse and allied staffing segment resulted in a downward revision to this segment s near term forecast 
additionally  we were closely monitoring performance in our clinical trial services and physician staffing businesses due to a thin margin between the carrying amount and fair value of those respective reporting units as of the december  annual impairment testing 
these factors warranted impairment testing in the first quarter of  which  based on its results  we concluded that there was no impairment at march  second quarter interim impairment testing results during the second quarter of  our stock price declined further from december  in addition  slower than expected booking momentum and reduced contribution income in our nurse and allied staffing segment resulted in a downward revision to this segment s forecast 
additionally  we were closely monitoring the performance of the clinical trial services and physician staffing businesses due to a small margin between the carrying amount and fair value of those respective reporting units as of the december  annual impairment testing and the small margin between the carrying amount and fair value of the nurse and allied staffing reporting unit as of the march  interim impairment testing 
these factors warranted impairment testing in the second quarter of as a result of the june  interim impairment testing  we determined that the fair value of the nurse and allied staffing segment was lower than the respective carrying value 
the decrease in value was due to slower than expected booking momentum and reduced contribution income in the second quarter of which lowered the anticipated growth trend used for goodwill impairment testing 
pursuant to the second step of the interim impairment testing we were required to calculate an implied fair value of goodwill based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
based on these results  we wrote off the remaining goodwill which resulted in a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million as of june  third quarter interim impairment testing results during the third quarter of  we continued to experience a sustained decrease in stock price compared to december  we continued to monitor the performance of the clinical trial services and physician staffing businesses due to the thin margin between the carrying amount and fair value as of the december  annual impairment testing and subsequent interim impairment tests 
upon completion of the third quarter interim impairment testing  we determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting units  with the exception of clinical trial services see note assets held for sale and discontinued operations  exceeded their respective carrying values 
fourth quarter annual impairment testing results we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of upon completion of the fourth quarter impairment testing  we determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as follows nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  retained search and education and training 
accordingly  no impairment charges were warranted for these reporting units as of december  the total fair value of our reporting units was reconciled to its december  market capitalization 
the reasonableness of the resulting control premium was assessed based on a review of comparative market transactions and other qualitative factors that might have influenced the company s stock price 
the fair value under the blended fair value approach implied a control premium of  which is within the range of amounts we estimate a buyer would be willing to pay in excess of the december  market price of in order to acquire a controlling interest 
our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of the reporting units 
our market capitalization as of december  was approximately million 
in performing the reconciliation of our market capitalization to fair value  we considered both quantitative and qualitative factors which supported the implied control premium 
we believe that a reasonable buyer would offer a control premium for the business that would adequately cover the difference between its market price at december  and its book value 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit that served as the primary basis for the income approach were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by us for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed within the company and externally 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates were involved in the application of the income methodology including forecasted revenue  margins  operating cash flows  discount rate  and working capital changes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of ten years were estimated using a terminal value calculation 
a terminal value growth rate of was used for each reporting unit 
the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates  representing each of the reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital  ranging from to 
the market approach generally applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded guideline companies that are comparable to our respective reporting units  and other specific data points  to determine their value 
we utilized total enterprise value revenue multiples ranging from to  and total enterprise value earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples ranging from to the reporting units values based on the market approach were determined assuming a weighting to revenue multiples and a weighting to ebitda multiples for all of its reporting units 
we estimated the fair value of the nurse and allied staffing reporting unit based entirely on the income approach as of december   september  and june  and the fair value of its education and training reporting entirely on the income approach as of december  had we applied the market approach to the nurse and allied staffing reporting unit or the education and training reporting unit  as it had done historically  it would have resulted in a very wide disparity between the revenue based and ebitda based implied market enterprise values 
accordingly  we concluded that the income approach was more appropriate in determining the fair value during each respective quarter 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions  therefore  in some instances minor changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
the table below provides a sensitivity analysis related to the impact of changes in certain key assumptions  on a standalone basis  on the percentage variance between fair value and carrying value for each of the reporting units with goodwill  with the exception of clinical trial services  recorded on our balance sheet sensitivity analysis fair value variance versus carrying value december  fair value variance versus carrying value basis point increase in wacc basis point decrease in terminal growth rate reduction in after tax cash flows physician staffing education and training retained search in addition  an increase in the assumed weighted average cost of capital of basis points could cause the fair value of our physician staffing trademark to be below its carrying value  or a reduction of million 
as of december   other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization on our consolidated balance sheets totaled million 
there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
fourth quarter impairment testing results upon completion of the first step in our annual impairment assessment as of december  and  we determined that no impairment was indicated 
in addition  the property  plant and equipment impairment of disposal of long lived assets topic of the fasb asc  requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in testing for potential impairment  if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows  we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment  if any 
in the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our annual testing of other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization  no impairments were identified 
as of december   other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization on our consolidated balance sheets totaled million 
fourth quarter impairment testing results in the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our annual testing of indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of approximately million of which million related to the physician staffing segment and million related to the nurse and allied staffing segment 
the assessment was impacted by a then recent reduction in locum tenens usage and the overall physician staffing needs of our customers 
based on the impact those trends had on the long term revenue forecast  our calculation of estimated fair value using the projected revenue stream indicated the carrying amount of the trademark may not have been fully recoverable 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets related to discontinued operations we used a consistent income approach and market approach to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill related to the clinical trial services staffing reporting unit 
discounted cash flows served as the primary basis for the income approach 
pricing multiples derived from publicly traded guideline companies that are comparable served as the basis for the market approach 
pursuant to the second step of our third quarter interim impairment testing  we were required to calculate an implied fair value of goodwill based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
as of the date of its third quarter filing  we had not finalized its second step of impairment testing due to the limited time period from the first indication of potential impairment to the date of filing and the complexities involved in estimating the fair value 
we recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately million as of september  this impairment analysis was finalized in the fourth quarter and did not result in any adjustment 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our evaluation of our assets held for sale  an additional impairment charge was recorded of approximately million 
the company considered the sale price from the buyer as its best indication of fair value as of december  see note subsequent events 
risk and uncertainties the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions that required significant judgments  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
specifically  further deterioration of demand for our services  further deterioration of labor market conditions  reduction of our stock price for an extended period  or other factors as described in item a risk factors  may affect our determination of fair value of each reporting unit 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
under the current credit agreement an impairment charge will not have an impact on our liquidity 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claims that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued compensation and benefits on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial models  as well as industry experience and trends 
if such models indicate that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment as well as actual company experience and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
corporate and field employees are covered through a partially self insured health plan 
workers compensation insurance accruals can fluctuate over time due to the number of employees and inflation  as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for case reserves and for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims  net of insurance receivables  an increase of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
as of december   and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for case reserves and for incurred but not reported professional liability claims  net of insurance receivables 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectability as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against us  if any  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business are described in legal proceedings 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as of december   we have deferred tax assets related to certain federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million for which we have recorded a valuation allowance of million 
the state carryforwards will expire between and the federal carryforwards expire between and the majority of the foreign carryforwards are in a jurisdiction with no expiration 
in addition  the tax effect resulting from our goodwill impairment charges recorded in the year ended december  and caused the net deferred tax liability position to change to a net deferred tax asset position at that time 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset related to goodwill impairment charges of million will be realized in the future with the exception of a specific state portion of the net deferred tax asset for which a valuation allowance of million has been recorded 
in considering whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider several sources of taxable income  including  but not limited to the following items the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences in the future 
carryback potential to support the utilization of the deferred tax asset 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in our determination at december   we relied partially on projections of future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  to reach our conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary on the net deferred tax asset  except as otherwise discussed 
however  if the levels of future taxable income we have projected are not achieved  there is a risk that we could not recover this entire net deferred tax asset 
we will continue  in the future  to evaluate whether or not the net deferred tax assets will be fully realized prior to expiration 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the current portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of other current liabilities  and the non current portion is included within other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   total unrecognized tax benefits recorded was million 
we have a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
our sales and other non income tax filings are subject to routine audits by authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business  which may result in assessments of additional taxes 
as a result of a state administrative ruling  we determined that additional sales and non income taxes were probable of being assessed for certain states 
the total amount accrued is based on our best estimate of our probable liability and is based on current available information and interpretation of relevant tax regulations 
in the fourth quarter of  we estimated an incremental sales and non income tax liability  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  of approximately million pretax 
approximately million of the estimated liability relates to tax years 
given the nature of the our business  significant subjectivity exists as to both whether sales and other non income tax can be assessed on the activity and how the sales tax will ultimately be measured by the relevant jurisdictions 
we make a determination each reporting period whether the estimates for sales and other non income taxes in certain states should be revised 
during the year ended december  based on revised estimates of probable settlement  an expected state non income tax audit assessment  and additional estimates for current year activity  we accrued an additional pretax liability related to these non income tax matters of approximately million  of which million related to the tax years 
the expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and the liability is reflected in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are working with professional tax advisors and state authorities to resolve these matters 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  asu  which is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
this asu adds an optional qualitative assessment for determining whether an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
companies have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if a company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount  it would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in that year 
however  if a company concludes otherwise  it must calculate the fair value of the asset  compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge  if any 
we elected not to use this option in our review of intangible assets in  as we determined there were indicators which triggered additional testing 
seasonality the number of healthcare professionals on assignment with us is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings 
hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate which impact our number of orders for a particular period 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
likewise  the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals 
in addition  we expect our physician staffing business to experience higher demand in the summer months as physicians take vacations 
this historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
in addition  typically  our first quarter results are negatively impacted by the reset of payroll taxes 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
our direct costs are affected by fluctuations in housing costs and healthcare and workers compensation insurance 
during  our direct costs increased as a result of rising housing costs 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments for healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our revolving loan and term loans under our credit agreement  which bears interest based on floating rates 
our term loan bears interest at a rate of  at our option  either i libor plus a leverage based margin or ii base rate plus a leverage based margin 
refer to liquidity and capital resources credit agreement included in item see management s discussion and analysis above for further discussion about our credit agreement and related interest rate swaps 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in the year ended december  excluding the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in and million in considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating less than million in and million in the year ended december  we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated less than of our consolidated revenue during the years ending december   and  and were primarily from the united kingdom 
in addition  approximately of selling  general and administrative expenses are related to certain software development and information technology support provided by our employees in pune  india 
we have not entered into any foreign currency hedges 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our non us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  included in other stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet
