item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  we have developed a plan to address our continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations that includes among other things  selling our public sector business and reducing overhead costs  but we cannot provide assurance that we can succeed in implementing this plan 
we may not be able to raise additional capital to fund future operating losses 
because of our negative cash flow  we have funded our operations through the issuance of common and preferred stock and debt 
our ability to continue to operate until our cash flow turns positive on a consistent basis may depend on our ability to continue to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt 
we may not be able to raise additional finds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we are not successful in raising any needed additional funds  we might have to significantly scale back or delay our growth plans  seek to sell the company or cease operations altogether 
any reduction or delay in our growth plans could materially adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace  take advantage of business opportunities and develop or enhance our services and technologies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion raising doubt about our financial viability 
as a result of our continuing losses and negative cash flows  our independent registered public accounting firm  bdo usa  llp  issued a going concern opinion in connection with their audit of our financial statements for the year ended december  this opinion expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
the going concern opinion could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business plan  result in our inability to win new contracts or retain existing contracts due to potential customers concern about our ability complete our contract obligations  result in the reluctance on the part of certain suppliers to do business with us  or adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
if the bank holding the million ges port charlotte term note were to accelerate the note s maturity or call on our guaranty it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue as a going concern 
the gas flow rate from the landfill supplying methane to our generators at the zemel road generating facility has declined since we started operation of the facility in late  in part due to a fire that occurred in early in the collection system owned and maintained by charlotte county 
this decline in gas flow has limited the output from our generators to between and of their capacity  thereby reducing monthly revenue of the facility 
while ges port charlotte  llc  a subsidiary of ours that owns the facility  remains current in its payments of principal and interest on the loan  the reduction in revenue has caused it to violate the debt service coverage covenant 
lime energy and its wholly owned subsidiary lime energy asset development  llc  each provided a guaranty to the bank to induce it to enter into the loan agreement 
the bank has declared a default under the loan  and increased the interest rate from libor to libor  but has elected to not take any further action at this time 
however  it does have the right to accelerate the loan or call on the guaranty at any time while the loan is in default 

table of contents we are in the process of engaging a design build firm to implement enhancements to the gas collection system to correct some of the issues contributing to the reduction in gas flow 
these improvements are anticipated to be completed by early fall of while the enhancements are being designed to increase the gas flow to a level that will permit us to operate the generators at full capacity  we will not know if they will achieve the desired gas flow rate until after they are finished 
it is also possible that enhancements will not result in a permanent increase in the gas flow  possibly leading to the need to implement further enhancements or expansion to the collection system in the future 
we have asked the bank to forbear accelerating the loan or calling on the guaranty for a period of time sufficient for us to complete work on the gas collection system and for us to attempt an orderly sale of the facility 
the bank is currently considering our request 
if the bank denies our request and proceeds to accelerate the loan or call on our guaranty  it is unlikely that we would have sufficient cash to pay the balance which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  possibly to the point that we would be unable to continue as a going concern 
we may not be able to find a buyer for the assets of ges port charlotte and if we are able to do so  any proceeds from a sale of the assets may be less than the current outstanding balance on the term note  requiring us to use some of our available cash to pay off the loan 
it is our intent to market the generating facility held by ges port charlotte for sale once we have completed the enhancements to the gas collection system 
we may not be able to find a buyer on terms acceptable to us  or at all  in which case we will need to pay the balance of the loan from our available cash or obtain a refinancing of the debt 
it is also possible that the price we receive from a buyer will be less than the outstanding balance on the term note  in which case we would have to use some of our available cash to make up the shortfall between the sale price and the loan balance 
our use of cash for paying the balance of the loan if we are unable to sell the assets or making up any shortfall between a sale price and the loan balance could impact the growth of our utility business and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or cause us to need to seek to raise additional capital 
if we need to raise additional capital  we may not be able to do so  or we may only be able to do so on terms that are not favorable to us 
any award granted the plaintiffs under the current stockholder lawsuits  in combination with the cost of defending against the lawsuits  could exceed the limits of our director s and officer s insurance 
several stockholder lawsuits were filed against current and former members of our executive management shortly after we announced that investors should not rely on our historical financial statements 
these lawsuits have been consolidated into one lawsuit 
in addition two derivative lawsuits were filed against current and former members of our board of directors  also in connection with the announcement  which have been consolidated 
the company is generally obligated to indemnify its executives and board members from claims related to their position with the company  including paying defense costs 
we have a directors and officers insurance policy to help offset the cost of that indemnification 
subject to any defenses to coverage that the insurance carrier successfully asserts  this policy will cover the cost of that indemnification  up to the aggregate limit of million  including our  retention  which we must pay 
the insurance carrier has not asserted any defenses to coverage  but has reserved its right to do so 
the plaintiffs have not specified the amount of damages they are seeking  but if they are ultimately awarded an amount that exceeds the limits of our d o insurance policy after paying defense costs or if the insurance carrier successfully asserts any defenses to coverage  we will need to use our available cash to pay any defense costs or awards not covered by our d o policy 
any such payments  if large enough  
table of contents could have an adverse impact on our financial condition  possibly to the point that we would be unable to continue as a going concern 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could  if not remediated  result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting  as defined in rule a f under the securities exchange act 
as disclosed in item a  our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition  which led to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years to and the first quarter of fiscal year  as discussed in the explanatory note at the beginning of this report and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
a material weakness is defined as a deficiency  or combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
as a result of this material weakness  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal control an integrated framework 
we implemented a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness 
if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future  our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results in the future  which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements  limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
the securities and exchange commission is investigating us and the results of that investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the securities and exchange commission is conducting an investigation of our revenue recognition practices and financial reporting 
if  as a result of that investigation  the sec takes action against us or our officers  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customers and investors may lose confidence in us because of our restatement 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report and the explanatory note at the beginning of this report  in this report we have restated our consolidated financial statements for certain prior periods to correct certain errors in those financial statements 
the restatement may cause customers and investors to lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures  may raise reputational issues for our business and may result in a decline in share price or the loss of customers  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
it is difficult for us to estimate our future quarterly operating results 
despite the sale of our public sector business  our revenue remains somewhat seasonal 
historically  this seasonality has caused our revenue  operating income  net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the last two quarters of each year 
in addition  utility contracts can be subject to changes in budget allocations for the programs 
in the past we experienced a situation where funds allocated for a program we were operating under were diverted to 
table of contents other uses with no warning  reducing our expected revenue under this program 
as a result  we may be unable to forecast our revenue accurately  and a failure to meet our revenue or expense forecasts could have an immediate and negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and if we are unable to compete successfully our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected 
the energy efficiency solutions market is highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase and intensify as the energy efficiency solutions market continues to evolve 
we face strong competition primarily from other providers of energy efficiency solutions  local electrical and mechanical contractors and engineering firms  lighting and lighting fixture manufacturers and lighting fixture distributors 
we compete primarily on the basis of client service and support  quality and scope of services and products  including proprietary technology  cost of services and products  name recognition and our performance track record for services provided 
in addition to our existing competitors  new competitors such as large national or multinational engineering and or construction companies could enter our markets 
many of these current and potential competitors are better capitalized than we are  have longer operating histories and strong existing client relationships  greater name recognition  and more extensive engineering  technology and sales and marketing capabilities 
competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing a competing business model or energy efficiency solutions that may be potentially more attractive to clients than our products or services 
in addition  we may face competition from other products or technologies that reduce demand for electricity 
our competitors may also offer energy efficiency solutions at reduced prices in order to improve their competitive positions 
any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain clients  require us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive  and reduce our revenue and profitability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success is largely dependent upon the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain other skilled personnel  and the loss of their services or our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business or to maintain profitable operations 
our future success will depend largely on the skills  efforts  and motivation of our executive officers and other senior managers 
the loss of the service of executive officers and other senior managers or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business  implement our strategy or maintain profitable operations 
in addition  to execute our growth strategy and maintain our margins  we must attract and retain other skilled personnel with an extensive understanding of the energy efficiency regulatory framework and an effective sales force that can accurately price and manage our clients energy efficiency solution contracts 
competition for hiring these individuals is intense 
if we fail to attract and retain highly qualified skilled personnel  our business and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon a limited number of utility contracts to generate substantially all of our revenue 
with the sale of our public sector business  approximately of our revenue will be derived from nine utility contracts  with four of these contracts generating to of the total revenue 
while these contracts are typically multi year  the utilities are required to re bid them at the end of their term  therefore our ability to retain these contracts is not assured 
it is also possible that utilities could have a change of strategy for achieving their energy efficiency goals  de emphasizing the small business direct install programs under which we currently operate 
a utility could also decide to reduce the 
table of contents incentives available to small businesses under our program  thereby reducing the effectiveness of our sales efforts 
the loss of  or substantial reduction in sales to any of our utility clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure of our subcontractors to properly and effectively perform their services in a timely manner could cause delays in the delivery of our energy efficiency solutions 
our success depends on our ability to provide quality  reliable energy efficiency solutions in a timely manner  which in part requires the proper removal and installation of lighting  mechanical and electrical systems and other products by the subcontractors upon which we depend 
almost all of our energy efficiency solutions are installed by contractors or subcontractors 
any delays  malfunctions  inefficiencies or interruptions in the installation of our energy efficiency solutions caused by our subcontractors could put us at risk of a utility terminating a contract pre maturely  jeopardize our ability to retain a contract when it comes up for renewal  and harm our reputation in the marketplace 
such delays could also result in additional costs that could affect the profit margin of our projects 
if our information technology systems fail  or if we experience operation interruptions  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems 
we rely on those systems generally to manage the day to day operation of our business  manage relationships with our clients and maintain our financial and accounting records 
the failure of our information technology systems  our inability to successfully maintain and enhance our information technology systems  or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our information technology systems  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  disrupt our business and make us unable  or severely limit our ability  to respond to client demands 
in addition  our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  employee or other theft  attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power outages  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
any interruption of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenue  increased expenses  increased capital expenditures  client dissatisfaction and lawsuits  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
product liability and personal injury claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face exposure to product liability and personal injury claims in the event that our energy efficiency solutions fail to perform as expected or cause bodily injury or property damage 
since the majority of our products use electricity  it is possible that the products we sell could result in injury  whether due to product malfunctions  defects  improper installation or other causes 
further  we face exposure to personal injury claims in the event that an individual is injured as a result of our negligence or the negligence of one of our subcontractors 
moreover  we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us 
a successful product liability or personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials and at times requires that our contractors or subcontractors work in hazardous conditions  either of which could give rise to a claim against us 
when we retrofit a client s facility  we assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures 
certain components of these fixtures contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials 
older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls  or pcbs 
we utilize licensed and insured hazardous wastes disposal companies to remove and or dispose of such components 
failure to properly handle  remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe  effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability againts us  or could expose our workers  our subcontractor s workers or other persons to these hazardous materials  which could result in claims against us 
further  our workers and subcontractor s workers are sometimes required to work in hazardous environments that present a risk of serious personal injury which could result in claims against us 
a successful personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to manage our anticipated revenue growth effectively  our operations and profitability could be adversely affected 
we intend to undertake a number of strategies in an effort to grow our revenue 
we cannot provide assurance that those strategies will be successful  but if they are  our revenue growth may place significant strain on our current resources 
to properly manage any future revenue growth  we must continue to improve our management  operational  administrative  accounting and financial reporting systems and expand  train and manage our employee base  which may involve significant expenditures and increased operating costs 
due to our limited resources and experience  we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and adequately train additional qualified personnel 
if we are unable to manage our anticipated revenue growth effectively  the quality of our client care may suffer  we may experience client dissatisfaction  reduced future revenue or increased warranty claims  and our expenses could substantially and disproportionately increase 
any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to additional limitation  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability 
generally  a change of more than in the ownership of a company s stock  by value  over a three year period constitutes an ownership change for us federal income tax purposes 
an ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards attributable to the period prior to such change 
we have sold or otherwise issued shares of our common stock in various transactions sufficient to constitute an ownership change  including our public offering in and the conversion of all of our outstanding preferred stock and the conversion of all of our outstanding convertible notes 
as a result  if we earn net taxable income  our ability to use our pre change net operating loss carry forwards  which amounted to million as of december   to offset us federal taxable income will be subject to limitations  which will likely result in increased future tax liability 
in addition  future shifts in our ownership  including transactions in which we may engage  may cause additional ownership changes  which could have the effect of imposing additional limitations on our ability to use our pre change net operating loss carry forwards 

table of contents risks related to ownership of our common stock our common stock is at risk of being delisted by nasdaq 
we have received delisting notices from nasdaq for failure to timely file our financial statements and for failing to maintain a minimum closing bid stock price of per share 
nasdaq has notified us that even if we take all corporate action necessary for a reverse stock split  no reverse stock split can take effect 
we have until july   to file our quarterly and annual financial statements for  august   to file our quarterly report for the first quarter of and august  to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price rule or we will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
we expect to implement a reverse stock split if necessary to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule  but we cannot do so until at least days after we have completed our financial statements for the first and second quarters of we believe that the filing of this annual report on form k and the accompanying quarterly report on form q satisfies the first requirement listed above  however we cannot assure that we will be able file our quarterly report for the first quarter of by august  or that we will be in compliance with the minimum bid price rule prior to august  if we fail to meet either of these deadlines nasdaq is likely to delist our stock  in which case we would list our stock on the over the counter exchange 
if our stock is listed on the over the counter exchange it may become more thinly traded  making it more difficult for stockholders to sell large blocks of shares and our share price may experience greater volatility 
as an over the counter listed company we may also find it more difficult to attract analyst coverage  which may result in a lower trading multiple for the stock 
we expect to implement a reverse stock split if necessary to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price rule  which may adversely affect our market capitalization and the market for our stock 
as discussed in the preceding risk factor  we expect to implement a reverse stock split if necessary to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price rule 
a reverse stock split may adverse affect our market capitalization 
there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our common stock after the reverse stock split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split 
a reverse stock split would also reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock  which may lead to reduced trading and a smaller number of market makers for our common stock 
in addition  our low stock price may have resulted in less short selling of our shares than would have occurred were our stock price higher 
following the reverse stock split  to the extent our per share trading price is higher  short selling of our stock could increase 
this may increase the volatility of our stock price 
the future trading market for our common stock may not be active on a consistent basis and the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations 
trading in our common stock has been limited and  at times  volatile since our shares were listed on the nasdaq capital market in february the trading volume of our common stock in the future depends in part on our ability to increase our revenue and reduce or eliminate our operating losses 
if we are unable to achieve these goals  the trading market for our common stock may be negatively affected  which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares 
an active trading market for our common stock may not develop or  if developed  be sustained  and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially 

table of contents the price of our common stock may also fluctuate as a result of variations in our operating results  announcements by us  our competitors or others of significant business developments  changes in client relationships  acquisitions or expansion plans  analysts earnings estimates  ratings and research reports  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  speculation in the press  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as sales promotions or acquisitions  actions by institutional and other stockholders  recruitment or departure of key personnel  or domestic and international economic factors and trends  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets  in general  periodically experience volatility that is sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  following a period of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company 
because of the potential volatility of our common stock price  we may become the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
we expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock could decline substantially  and we could become subject to securities litigation 
our business is seasonal and can be affected by cyclical factors outside of our control 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
you should not rely upon the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
our revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  these fluctuations in our revenue may result in volatility in our results of operations and or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock falls significantly we may be the target of securities litigation 
if we become involved in this type of litigation  regardless of the outcome  we could incur substantial legal costs  management s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business  and our reputation could be damaged  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 

table of contents if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their evaluations of our stock  the price of our stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
since announcing the need to restate our historical results  all of the analysts that were following us have dropped or suspended coverage 
if these analysts don t resume coverage or if we cannot find other analysts willing to pick up coverage of our stock the price of our stock could stagnate or decline 
if one or more analysts do pick up coverage on us  but subsequently downgrades their estimates or evaluations of our stock  the price of our stock could decline 
due to the concentration of holdings of our stock  a limited number of investors may be able to control matters requiring common stockholder approval or could cause our stock price to decline through future sales because they beneficially own a large percentage of our common stock 
there were  shares of our common stock outstanding as of july   of which a total of seven members of our board and executive management beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 
as a result of their significant ownership  these investors may have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over our business and corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors  a sale of substantially all of our assets  a merger between us and another entity or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation 
this concentration of ownership could delay  defer or prevent a change of control and could adversely affect the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
also  in the event of a sale of our business  these investors could be able to seek to receive a control premium to the exclusion of other common stockholders 
a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock  including the shares beneficially owned by these holders  can be sold in the public market from time to time  subject to limitations imposed by federal securities laws 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our presently outstanding shares of common stock by these investors or other stockholders in the public market or due to the perception that these sales could occur 
this could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our equity securities or for you to sell your shares if you choose to do so 
the large concentration of our shares held by this small group of stockholders could result in increased volatility in our stock price due to the limited number of shares available in the market 
raising additional capital or consummation of additional acquisitions through the issuance of equity or equity linked securities could dilute your ownership interest 
it is likely that we may find it necessary to raise capital again sometime in the future or to consummate additional acquisitions through the issuance of equity or equity linked securities 
if we raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders will likely experience dilution of their present equity ownership position and voting rights 
depending on the number of shares issued and the terms and conditions of the issuance  new equity securities could have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
depending on the terms  common stock holders may not have approval rights with respect to such issuances 

table of contents provisions of our charter and by laws  in particular our blank check preferred stock  and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent or discourage an acquisition of our company that would benefit our stockholders 
provisions of our charter and by laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if a change in control would benefit our stockholders 
in particular  shares of our preferred stock may be issued in the future without further stockholder approval and upon those terms and conditions  and having those rights  privileges and preferences  as our board of directors may determine 
in the past  we have issued preferred stock with dividend and liquidation preferences over our common stock  and with certain approval rights not accorded to our common stock  and which was convertible into shares of our common stock at a price lower than the market price of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock we may issue in the future 
the issuance of our preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in pursuing possible additional equity financings and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and discourage these investors from acquiring a majority of our common stock 
in addition  the price that future investors may be willing to pay for our common stock may be lower due to the conversion price and exercise price granted to investors in any such private financing 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to certain delaware anti takeover provisions  including the application of section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally restricts our ability to engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of our capital stock 
our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and the dodd frank act  and rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the nasdaq stock market  have imposed substantial requirements on public companies  including with respect to public disclosure  internal control  corporate governance practices and other matters 
our management and other personnel are devoting substantial amounts of time and resources to comply with these evolving laws  regulations and standards 
moreover  these laws  regulations and standards have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  we could incur significant costs to remediate any material weaknesses we identify through these efforts 
we currently are evaluating and monitoring development with respect to these evolving laws  regulations and standards  and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
these new regulatory requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities  which could harm our business prospects and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock

restatement as discussed in the explanatory note at the beginning of this report  we are restating our financial statements for the years ended december    and and for the quarter ended march  as a consequence of that restatement  we were unable to timely file our annual report for the year ended december   and our quarterly reports for the quarters ended june   september   and march  this report contains our restated financial statements for the year ended december   and a reconciliation of those restated financial statements to those we previously filed for the same period  and a restatement of all line items in our  and financial statements requiring restatement  as well as a reconciliation of those restated amounts to our previously filed financial statements for those years 
additional information regarding the restatement  the events that necessitated the restatement and our response to those events is contained in the explanatory note at the beginning of this report 
overview general we are a leader in designing and implementing energy efficiency programs that enable our utility clients to reach their underserved markets and achieve their energy reduction goals 
we provide our energy efficiency program delivery services exclusively within the utility sector  and our clients include two of the five largest investor owned utilities in the country 
we focus on deploying direct install energy efficiency solutions for small and mid size commercial and industrial business programs that improve energy efficiency  reduce energy related expenditures and lessen the impact of energy use on the environment 
currently  these solutions include energy efficient lighting upgrades and energy efficient mechanical upgrades 
our small business direct install sbdi programs provide a cost effective avenue for our utility clients to offer products and services to a hard to reach customer base while satisfying aggressive state mandated energy reduction goals 
the direct install model is a turnkey solution under which we contract with the utility clients to design and market their small and mid sized efficiency programs within a defined territory  perform the technical audits  sell the solution to the end use customer and oversee the implementation of the energy efficiency measures 
the model makes it easy and affordable for small businesses to upgrade to energy efficiency equipment and is a dependable and cost effective way for our utility clients to achieve their energy efficiency goals 
approximately of our revenue was generated from work for the army corps of engineers and from our regional service business 
we provide services to the army corps of engineers under its facility repair and renewal frr program 
we are one of three contractors qualified to bid for work under this program 
as part of this program we provide project investigation  and design build execution for all types of facility repairs  conversions  renovations  alterations  additions  construction and equipment installation in the federal buildings in the us and us territories 
our regional service business is located in bethlehem pennsylvania and offers hvac service to local commercial and industrial clients 
this group has been working with our new jersey utility program to offer hvac 
table of contents maintenance services to customers of this utility program who upgrade their hvac equipment utilizing incentives available through the program 
revenue and expense components revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services and the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
we charge our utility clients based on an agreed to rate schedule based on the item installed or the savings generated 
our contracts with the army corps of engineers are all fixed price contracts under which we bill the army corps on a monthly basis for work completed in the prior month as specified in the contract 
a typical project for a small business utility client can take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks to complete  whereas our projects for the army corps can take six months to two years to complete 
our revenues are somewhat seasonal with the strongest sales occurring in the second half of the year 
revenue recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
we recognize the revenue utilizing the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
under the percentage of completion method we recognize revenue throughout the term of the project based on the percentage of costs incurred 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue concentration during our three largest utility clients  niagara mohawk national grid  the new jersey board of public utilities and long island power  were responsible for  and of our consolidated revenue  respectively  while revenue generated from the army corps generated of our consolidated revenue all figures exclude discontinued operations 
during  our two largest utility clients  niagara mohawk and the new jersey board of public utilities  were responsible for and of our consolidated revenue  respectively  while the army corps was responsible for of our consolidated revenue 
we expect that contracts with large utilities will continue to be a significant and growing source of revenue for us in the future  while the army corps will continue to be responsible for a smaller portion of our total revenue 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor and the cost of subcontracted labor 

table of contents gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
we subcontract the vast majority of our installation and construction work  therefore our cost of goods sold consists almost exclusively of variable costs 
accordingly  our cost of sales will vary directly with changes in revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  expenses related to our management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles when we acquire other companies we are required to allocate the purchase price between identifiable tangible and intangible assets  with any remaining value allocated to goodwill 
the value allocated to intangible assets is amortized over the estimated life of the related asset 
the acquisitions we completed within  and resulted in approximately million of intangible assets  the substantial majority of which has already been amortized or has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
the acquisition of the zemel road gas rights also resulted in the creation of an intangible asset of million 
we were amortizing this asset over the year term of the contract  however  during the fourth quarter of we determined that the fair market value of our investment in the zemel road facility was less than our carrying value 
therefore  as part of reducing the carrying value to the fair market value  we wrote off the remaining value of this intangible asset 
based on the value of our remaining intangible assets  we expect to record amortization expense of  in  after which our intangible assets will be fully amortized 
interest expense  net net interest expense consists of interest expense net of interest income 
net interest expense represents the interest costs associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  the term note used to finance the construction of the zemel road generating facility  our line of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  and various vehicle loans 
we repaid the mortgage in october interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
general business trends and recent developments the trends  events  and uncertainties set out in this section have been identified as those we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the comparison of historical operating results reported in this report to either other past period results or to future operating results 
these trends  events and uncertainties include 
table of contents restatement of prior financial statements in july  we discovered that certain members of our accounting and operations staff worked together to prematurely recognize revenue  and in some circumstances recognize revenue when no valid customer contract existed 
upon making this discovery  we initiated an in depth review of all material revenue transactions and discovered that these activities began in as a result  we have restated our financial statements for the periods from january through march  the restated annual financial statements are included in the accompanying financial statements  along with information regarding changes to financial statement accounts resulting from the restatement 
restated quarterly financial statements for and the first quarter of are included in quarterly report on form q for the nine month period ended september investors should not rely on previously filed financial statements for the period from january through march for additional information regarding the restatement please refer to note in the accompanying financial statements 
sale of our esco business and shut down of lime energy asset development most of the projects for public sector clients require that we post surety bonds to insure that we pay our subcontractors and perform our obligations under the contract 
prior to the announcement of the need to restate our financial statements in july  we were able to obtain these bonds without the need to post any type of collateral 
after announcing that our prior financial statements should not be relied upon  some of the surety companies that had been providing our surety bonds refused to issue any new bonds until our restated financial statements where available  while others started requiring collateral of between and of the amount of the bond 
having recently been awarded a significant number of new public sector contracts that would require bonds  and knowing that we would not be able meet the sureties collateral requirements without impairing our working capital position  we decided to sell the public sector business 
on february   we sold all of the public sector business  except for the frr contract with the army corps of engineers and our regional hvac service business located in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
the portion of the business that was sold is commonly referred to as the esco business because it is the portion whose primary customers were the large energy service companies 
this business represented about half of our revenue 
compared to the utility business that we have retained  the esco business was growing at a slower rate  was less profitable and required higher levels of working capital 
utilizing the sale price we received for this business as an indicator of its fair value  we determined that our carrying value of this business exceeded the fair value 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value to the estimated fair value during the fourth quarter of  incurring a million impairment charge as a result 
the esco business has been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
we have also included our asset development group in discontinued operations 
lime energy asset development lead was established in to develop  construct and operate renewable and alternative energy projects 
this group was focused on leveraging the existing engineering and construction expertise contained in our public sector business to secure design build contracts for projects ranging in size from million to million 
the zemel road landfill gas to electricity facility was built in part to demonstrate our ability to develop these types of projects 
while lead found many opportunities to develop projects of the type it was targeting  it was unable to find a source of capital to finance the projects 
after having completed an extensive search for a source of capital  and given the decision to sell the public sector business  we decided to shut down the asset development business in the fourth quarter of  though we continue to own and operate the zemel road facility 
for additional information regarding discontinued operations please refer to note in the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  warranty accrual  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue and profit recognition since the acquisition of applied energy management in june  most of our revenue has been recognized using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred 
under this method of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance is largely based upon specific knowledge of clients from whom collection is determined to be doubtful and our historical collection experience with such clients 
if the financial condition of our clients or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  or if our estimates of certain clients ability to pay are incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
under certain of our utility contracts  we offer extended payment terms of or months to our small business customers for the portion of the cost of the work we perform that is not covered by utility incentives 
we require that most of these customers provide us with a credit card or e check authorization that we can charge for their monthly payment 
this reduces our administrative cost of invoicing and collecting many small monthly payments and also gives us an earlier indication of a potential collection issue 
as these programs have expanded and we have gained additional experience dealing with them we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts 
during we increased our allowance by thousand from thousand to million 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was equal to approximately of our outstanding accounts receivable 
we will continue to monitor our collections experience with these small business customers and adjust our allowance accordingly 

table of contents amortization of intangibles we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with asc  accounting for business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values  with the excess of purchase price being allocated to goodwill 
the determination of the fair values of these intangible assets is based on a number of significant assumptions as determined by us  including evaluations of the future income producing capabilities of these assets and related future expected cash flows or replacement cost of the asset 
we also make estimates about the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets 
should different conditions result in the determination that the value of the acquired intangible assets has been impaired  we could incur write downs of intangible assets  or changes in the estimation of useful lives of those intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing which is discussed in greater detail below 
intangible assets included acquired technology and software  customer and contractual relationships and gas rights 
acquired technology was initially recorded at its fair value based on the estimated after tax cost to replace the asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer and contractual relationships represent contractual and separable relationships that we have with certain customers and partners 
these contractual relationships were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the contractual relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful life 
the gas rights intangible asset represented the cost of acquiring the gas rights to the zemel road landfill 
this asset was being amortized over the term of the gas rights agreement  which is years 
all of our intangible assets  other than the technology and software and gas rights  are associated with the public sector business and therefore included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
utilizing the price we received in february for the sale of the esco business as an indicator of its fair value  we determined that our carrying value of this business exceeded the fair value as of the end of in adjusting the carrying value of this business to reflect its indicated fair value we reduced the carrying value of the associated intangibles to during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
also during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of the zemel road gas rights to as part of our decision to reduce the carrying value of the zemel road assets to their fair market value which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
as of december   the only intangible asset remaining in continuing operations was the technology and software intangible  which will become fully amortized during the first half of impairment loss we evaluate all of our long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill and fixed assets  periodically for impairment in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

table of contents utilizing the price we received in february for the sale of the esco business as an indicator of its fair value  we determined that our carrying value of this business exceeded the fair value as of the end of accordingly  we reduced the carrying value to the estimated fair value during the fourth quarter of  incurring a million impairment charge as a result 
this charge included thousand related to the write off of property  plant and equipment 
during early  the quality and quantity of gas coming from the well field on the zemel road landfill began to deteriorate  in part due to a fire in the well field 
during the fourth quarter of  we updated our projections for future cash flows from the facility given the lower gas flow rates and higher anticipated operating expenses and determined that the fair market value was less than our current carrying value 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter to reduce the value of this asset to our estimate of fair market value 
this charge included million related to the write down of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is less than value based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
many assumptions and estimates underlie the determination of an impairment loss  including economic and competitive conditions  operating costs and efficiencies 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
the price we received in february for the sale of the esco business indicated that the carrying value of the assets associated with this business was impaired 
in adjusting the carrying value to the indicated fair value  we reduced the value of goodwill associated with this business by million during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of we completed our analyses for the c i and aem reporting units and concluded that the implied fair value of the aem reporting unit  based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows  substantially exceeded the carrying value  indicating that the goodwill was not impaired 
however  due to a significant decline in the performance of the c i reporting unit during  we determined that the fair value of its goodwill had declined to  as a result  we reduced the carrying value of the goodwill from million to  incurring a million impairment loss during the period 
our utility business was established in utilizing resources we acquired as part of the acquisition of applied energy management 
with the decision to sell most of the original aem business  while retaining the utility business  we have allocated the goodwill associated with the aem reporting unit between the public sector business and the utility business based on their relative fair values as of december  the portion of goodwill allocated to the public sector business has been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an impairment analysis of the goodwill associated with the utility reporting unit and found that based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows  the implied fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value  indicating that goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents we considered various factors in determining the fair value of the testing units  including discounted cash flows from projected earnings  values for comparable companies and the market price of our common stock 
we will continue to monitor for any impairment indicators such as underperformance of projected earnings  net book value compared to market capitalization  declining stock price and significant adverse economic and industry trends 
in the event that either testing unit does not achieve projected results  or  as the result of changes in facts or circumstances  we could incur an additional goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
share based compensation we have stock incentive plans that provide for stock based employee and director compensation  including the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock  to certain key employees and non employee directors 
these plans are more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
consistent with asc  share based payment  we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options and restricted stock unit grants  over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we recognized million and million of stock compensation related to employee options expense  employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants during and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services as well as the sale of the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
all of our revenue is earned in the united states 
we charge our utility customers utilizing an agreed to rate schedule based on the item installed or the savings generated 
our contracts with the army corps of engineers are all fixed price contracts 
under these fixed price contracts  we bill the army corps on a monthly basis for work completed in the prior month as specified in the contract 
a typical project for a small business utility customer can take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks to complete  whereas our projects for the army corps can take six months to two years to complete 
our revenues are somewhat seasonal with the strongest sales occurring in the second half of the year 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less costs of sales 
the cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
since we subcontract almost all of our construction work to independent contractors there is very little fixed cost included in our cost of sales 
the gross margin earned in our different markets and from different programs within markets varies  with our work under the frr contract generating the lowest margins 
the mix of business generated from our various markets and programs will change throughout the year  due in part to varying activity levels under existing programs and the growth of new programs  which will affect our consolidated gross margin 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  costs of our management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles we incur expenses related to the amortization of identifiable assets that we have capitalized in connection with our acquisitions 
other expense other expense consists of interest expense  net of interest earned on our investments 
interest expense represents the interest costs and fees associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  term notes and various vehicle loans 
interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
we offer certain customers extended payment terms 
when we record receivables with payments terms of more than months we are required to discount them using a market rate of interest and amortize the discount over the term of the receivable 
this amortization is recognized as interest income

table of contents revenue our revenue for the twelve month period ended december   increased million  or  to million from million for the same period during a million or increase in revenue from our utility business was partially offset by a million decline in revenue generated under the frr contract 
the utility business benefited from a full year of contributions from our program with long island power and the start up of the central hudson and nstar programs  but this was partially offset by lower revenue from the national grid program 
most of our utility contracts have annual goals 
during we met our goal for national grid by early fall and were given additional goals to make up for under performing territories being run by other companies 
during  we again met our goal by early fall  but did not receive as much additional goal for the year  contributing to the decline in revenue for this program over the prior year 
increased revenue contributions from central hudson and nstar  in combination with contributions from our new aep ohio and duke energy contracts and to a lesser extent  the efficiency maine contract  are all expected to contribute to higher revenue from the utility business in we also continue to bid on new contracts in different regions of the country  which if we are successful in winning  could also contribute to increased revenue 
we have two utility contracts up for renewal in national grid and new jersey direct 
we have been the top performer under both of these programs in every year we have been a part of the program  consequently  we believe that there is a good possibility that these contracts will be retained  however  this is not assured 
combined these two contracts were responsible for approximately of our revenue 
revenue under the frr program varies depending on the number of projects we are working on at any particular time and the stage the project is in 
we had fewer active projects during than we did during and these projects were either wrapping up or in the design phase for much of the year 
this all contributed to the decline in revenue under this program for  when compared to we expect that frr will generate between million and million in revenue during  but we currently have no expectation for this program to generate any significant revenue in revenue from ges port charlotte increased thousand  to thousand in from thousand in the facility began generating electricity in november with sufficient gas flow to operate both generators at capacity 
during the gas flow declined  in part due to a fire in the collection system  to the point where the generators were only able to operate at to of capacity 
charlotte county  the owner of the gas collection system  has recently completed some work on the collection system that has helped to improve the gas flow  however we expect that we will have to invest  to  to make additional changes to the system in order to increase the gas flow to a level that will permit us to operate our generators at capacity 
we are currently seeking proposals for this work and hope to have it completed by the end of september although we expect our quarterly revenue will be higher during on a year over year basis  we expect between and of our revenue will be earned during the second half of the year as new utility programs continue to grow and our frr projects move from the design phase into construction 
gross profit our gross profit increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december   when compared to the million earned during our gross profit margin improved from in to in the increase in the gross margin was the result of a reduction in the portion of total consolidated revenue generated by the low margin frr program  
table of contents combined with an increase in the gross margin earned by the utility business  which benefited from improvements in operating efficiencies 
we believe that our gross margin should continue to improve as new utility programs begin to contribute more to our total revenue and we continue to implement improvements to increase efficiencies within the programs 
selling  general administrative expense our sg a expense increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december   from million during the year earlier period 
sg a as a percent of revenue increased from in to in costs related to the restatement and related stockholder lawsuits contributed million to the increase in sg a 
the balance of the increase in sg a was due to the start up of new utility programs and the annualization of costs associated with programs started in as we entered we were operating under three utility programs national grid which started in late  new jersey direct  which started in the spring of and long island power  which began operation during the fourth quarter of during we started up  or were in the process of starting up central hudson  nstar  aep ohio  duke energy  and efficiency maine 
when we start up a new program we incur several months of expenses before we start to generate any revenue  as we open an office in the territory  hire a program manager and staff  train the staff  prepare a marketing plan and materials and start calling on customers 
it usually takes three to six months before a program s revenue reaches the level necessary to generate a profit 
during  we had five programs in various stages of start up  contributing to the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue 
we expect that sg a as a percentage of revenue will decline during  as revenue from new programs ramps up 
we also expect to incur an additional million to million in costs related to the restatement and stockholder lawsuits during amortization of intangibles amortization expense increased thousand  to thousand during  from thousand during the increase was due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization expense for the zemel road gas rights 
the gas rights were written off at the end of  therefore the only remaining intangible asset as of the end of was technology and software  which will become fully amortized during the first half of restructuring charge during  we initiated a restructuring to reduce costs  streamline our organization and better integrate our operations 
as part of this we moved our corporate headquarters to huntersville  north carolina  sold our former headquarters building in elk grove village  illinois  and consolidated certain accounting and administrative functions in huntersville 
in connection with this restructuring we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million consisting primarily of severance related costs and costs associated with the sale of our building 
included in the million charge is approximately thousand of non cash share based compensation expense incurred when the vesting of equity based compensation was accelerated due to involuntary terminations 
impairment loss during the fourth quarter of  we updated our projections for the zemel road landfill gas to electricity facility based on the first year of operating results and expectations regarding planned improvements to the gas collection system 
the discounted expected future cash flows for the facility indicated than the current carrying value of this asset exceeded its estimated fair market value by million 
we recorded an impairment charge of an equal amount during the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value to our estimated fair market value 
also  utilizing the price we received for the 
table of contents sale of the esoc business in february as an indicator of its fair value  we determined that the carrying value of the assets associated with this business were impaired 
in adjusting the carrying value to the fair value we incurred a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of other income other non operating expense increased from thousand of net income during to thousand of net expense for interest expense increased during the year ended december  to thousand from thousand during the year earlier period 
the components of interest expense for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands year ended december  line of credit term note mortgage note subordinated convertible notes other change in value of interest rate swap amortization of deferred issuance costs and debt discount total interest expense less discontinued operations continuing operations total contractual interest expense the interest on outstanding loan balances increased thousand  to thousand during from thousand in the increase in contractual interest expense was primarily the result of the term note added in november  and the subordinated convertible notes  which were put in place in october we have deferred certain costs associated with the issuance of the term loan  subordinated convertible notes and our line of credit 
these costs are being amortized over the terms of the associated debt 
we incurred thousand and thousand of amortization expense during and  respectively 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on million of the million original balance on the term note 
this interest rate swap was not designated for hedge accounting under asc  therefore we record changes in its fair value as non operating interest income or expense with an offsetting entry to a swap asset or swap liability 
we recorded expense of thousand and thousand due to a declines in the fair market value of this interest rate swap during and  respectively 
our interest income decreased thousand to thousand during  from thousand during all of the income recorded during was amortization of the discount on our long term receivables  while approximately thousand of the interest income was amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
the decline in amortization is due to a reduction in our long term receivables  which had historically been used by our c i customers 
we expect these balances to increase in the future due to increased use of extended payment terms by customers under some of our utility programs 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview during the twelve month period ended december   we incurred a net loss of million and used million of cash for operating activities 
primarily as a result of our continuing losses and lack of liquidity  our independent registered public accounting firm modified their opinion on our december  consolidated financial statement to contain a paragraph wherein they expressed a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have taken steps to reduce our losses and improve out liquidity  the most significant of which was to sell our esco business 
we provide additional insight into our strategy for strengthening our financial position below 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  including thousand of restricted cash  compared to cash of million  including restricted cash of thousand as of december  our contractual obligations as of december  totaled million  and include million of debt including expected interest payments of million and million in future lease obligations 
our contractual commitments for total approximately million  which we believe we will be able to satisfy through operating cash flows and our cash reserve 
our principal cash requirements are for operating expenses  including employee costs  the cost of outside services including those providing accounting  legal and contracting services  and the funding of accounts receivable  and capital expenditures 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of our common and preferred stock  as well as through various forms of secured debt 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected items in our consolidated statement of cash flows in thousands year ended december net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  at end of period compared to net cash declined million during the twelve month period ended december   compared to declining million during twelve month period ended december  
table of contents operating activities operating activities consumed million of cash during the twelve month period ended december   compared to consuming million during twelve month period ended december  whether cash is consumed or generated by operating activities is a function of the profitability of our operations and changes in working capital 
to get a better understanding of cash sources and uses  management splits the cash used or provided by operating activities into two pieces the cash consumed or generated by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities  and the cash consumed or generated from changes in assets and liabilities 
by splitting the cash used or provided by operating activities this way our management believes it gets a better understanding of how much of our operating cash flow is the result of the company s current period cash earnings or loss and how much of our operating cash flow is due to changes in working capital 
these two measures are calculated as follows in thousands year ended year ended december  december  restated net loss provision for bad debts share based compensation depreciation and amortization amortization of original issue discount amortization of deferred financing costs issuance of stock and warrants in exchange for services received pik notes issued for interest assert impairment loss on disposition of fixed assets goodwill impairment cash consumed by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities changes in assets and liabilities  net of business acquisitions and dispositions accounts receivable inventories costs in excess uncompleted contracts prepaid expenses and other current assets assets of discontinued operations accounts payable accrued expenses billings in excess uncompleted contracts other current liabilities liabilities of discontinued operations cash generated consumed from changes in assets and liabilities 
table of contents the reconciliation to net cash used in operating activities as reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows in thousands year ended year ended december  december  restated cash consumed by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities the cash consumed by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period during the increase in cash consumed was the result of the increase in cash sg a expense for the period due to the combination of the restatement related expenses and the start up of new utility programs 
we believe that expected growth in our revenue resulting from implementation of recently won contracts  in combination with an improvement in our gross margin and continued reductions in our sg a as a percentage of revenue  will result in a significant reduction in cash use during if we are successful in executing the strategy outlined below  we believe that we could begin to generate cash from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities during the second half of cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december  the change in business mix resulting from the slowdown in activity at our public sector business  which generally has higher working capital requirements  and the continued growth of our utility business  which generally has lower working capital requirements  led to the increase in cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities during with the sale of the public sector business in february  we expect to see additional improvement in the amount of working capital required to support the business in the future 
investing activities cash used in investing activities declined million  or  to thousand during the year ended december   compared to using million during the same period during during  we used thousand for the purchase of property and equipment  compared to using million during approximately million of the expenditures were used to construct the zemel road landfill gas to electricity facility 
the balance of the and capital expenditures were for computers  software and office equipment  primarily for the expansion of our utility business 
these expenditures were partially offset during by thousand received from the sale of our former headquarters in elk grove village  il 
reductions in restricted cash also helped to offset the purchase of property and equipment during both and during restricted cash used to support bonds declined by thousand while in there was a million reduction in restricted cash 

table of contents financing activities financing activities generated cash of million during  compared to generating million during in may  we sold million shares of our common stock  raising million and in october we raised million through the issuance of subordinated convertible notes 
during the year we also raised thousand from the sale of stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan 
these sources of cash were partial offset by scheduled principal payments of thousand and thousand of costs incurred in the issuance of the subordinated notes and thousand incurred in the issuance of the common stock 
during  we received million from a term loan used to finance a portion of the cost of the zemel road landfill gas to electricity facility  and thousand from the issuance of shares of our stock under employee benefit plans 
this was partially offset by thousand used to repay the mortgage on our former headquarters and other scheduled debt payments  and thousand of debt issuance costs 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our available  unrestricted cash reserves 
our ability to continue to expand the sales of our products and services will require the continued commitment of significant funds 
the actual timing and amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount  timing and profitability of future revenues  working capital requirements  the level and amount of product marketing and sales efforts  among other things 
we have raised a significant amount of capital since our formation through the issuance of shares of our common and preferred stock and notes  which has allowed us to continue to execute our business plan 
most of these funds have been consumed by operating activities  either to fund our losses or for working capital requirements 
we incurred a million loss during and consumed million of cash in operating activities during the  as we dealt with the impact on the business of the announcement regarding our discovery of improper revenue recognition  the inability of our asset development business to secure the financing required to fund its projects and the start up of five new utility programs 
late last year our management  in consultation with our board of directors  decided that we needed to shed businesses that we could not finance  narrow our focus to our most promising business and reduce overhead costs 
consistent with this strategy  we shut down the asset development business  sold the esco business and made significant reductions in remaining headcount 
approximately of our revenue is expected to be generated by our utility business  which has been our fastest growing business for the past three years 
it is also a business in which we believe we are the market leader  in a market we believe has good prospects for future growth 
the other remaining businesses will either be integrated into the utility business  if integration makes strategic sense  sold or operated until we have met all our obligations under our contracts and then shut down 
we most likely will not resolve the future of these other businesses until sometime in fortunately  they are each fairly autonomous and not expected to be a drain on cash 
we have experienced a marked improvement in cash flow as we have begun to implement this strategy 
we expect continued improvements as new utility programs start to achieve profitability and restatement related costs decline 
we believe that as a result of these changes  there is a chance we will achieve profitability on a consolidated basis before the end of the year  though it is likely we will report a loss for full year we continue to closely monitor our cash position and are prepared to attempt to raise additional capital if it is necessary to meet day to day operating needs 
if we do determine it necessary to raise additional capital there is no assurance we will be able to do so  or it may only be 
table of contents available on terms that are not favorable to the company or our existing shareholders 
we believe that we would be more likely to receive less onerous terms from a financing source the further we are along in executing our strategy of focusing on our utilities business when attempting to raise capital 
therefore  we will continue to focus on the execution of that strategy  while closely monitoring cash and deferring any capital raise as long as possible
