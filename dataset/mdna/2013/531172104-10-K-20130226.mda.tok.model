item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our business weakness in the general economy continues to adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the company business is subject to the risks in this section 
current economic conditions have increased the probability the company will experience these risks 
continuing weakness in the general economy has negatively impacted the company business practices by reducing demand for our properties 
this lack of demand has reduced our ability to achieve increases in rents as the spaces are leased 
the ongoing weakness in the general economy has affected some of our existing tenants  and could have an adverse impact on our ability to collect rent or renew leases with these tenants  resulting in a negative effect on our cash flow from operations 
the ongoing weakness in the general economy has had an adverse effect on many companies in numerous industries 
we have tenants in these and other industries which may be experiencing these adverse effects 
should any of our tenants experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition  delays lease commencement or causes it to fail to make rental payments when due  become insolvent or declare bankruptcy  the result could be a termination of the tenant lease and material losses to us 
our cash flow from operations and our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders and service our indebtedness could  in such a case  be adversely affected 
unfavorable events affecting our existing tenants  or negative market conditions that may affect our existing tenants  could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants  relet space  collect rent or renew leases  and thus could have a negative effect on our cash flow from operations 
our cash flow from operations depends on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms 
therefore  we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited control  such as lack of demand for space in the areas where our properties are located inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates defaults by our tenants or their failure to pay rent on a timely basis the need to periodically renovate and repair our space physical damage to our properties economic or physical decline of the areas where our properties are located potential risk of functional obsolescence of our properties over time 
table of contents if a tenant is unable to pay rent due to us  we may be forced to evict such tenants  or engage in other remedies  which may be expensive and time consuming and may adversely affect our net income  shareholders equity and cash distributions to shareholders 
if our tenants do not renew their leases as they expire  we may not be able to rent the space 
furthermore  leases that are renewed  and some new leases for space that is relet  may have terms that are less economically favorable to us than current lease terms  or may require us to incur significant costs  such as for renovations  tenant improvements or lease transaction costs 
any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders and service our indebtedness 
a significant portion of our costs  such as real estate taxes  insurance costs  and debt service payments  generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from our properties 
we may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry 
we experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for our properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire 
in our effort to lease our properties  we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of our markets 
these competitors include  among others  publicly held reits  privately held entities  individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space 
some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial or other terms than we are able to offer 
we may experience increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our operations 
our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance  cleaning  electricity  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  general and administrative costs and other costs associated with security  landscaping  repairs and maintenance 
while our current tenants generally are obligated to pay a significant portion of these costs  there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or that new tenants will agree to pay these costs 
if operating expenses increase in our markets  we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets so as to meet increased expenses without simultaneously decreasing occupancy rates 
if this occurs  our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 
our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on our ability to develop properties  which may suffer under certain circumstances 
we intend to continue to develop properties when warranted by market conditions 
our general construction and development activities include the risks that construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule  which could result in increased expenses and construction costs  and would result in reduced profitability construction costs may exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials  labor or other costs  possibly making the property unprofitable because we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs some developments may fail to achieve expectations  possibly making them unprofitable we may be unable to obtain  or may face delays in obtaining  required zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result  we may fail to recover costs already incurred 
if we alter or discontinue our development efforts  past and future costs of the investment may need to be expensed rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired  resulting in a loss we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects that we do not complete occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  and may result in lower than projected rental rates with the result that our investment is not profitable we face risks associated with property acquisitions 
we acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties  in some cases through the acquisition of operating entities  and intend to continue to do so when circumstances warrant 

table of contents our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks when we are able to locate a desirable property  competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price acquired properties may fail to perform as expected the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market  a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties and operating entities  into our existing operations  and as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets  and we therefore may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets 
our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas 
due to the concentration of our properties in these areas  performance is dependent on economic conditions in these areas 
these areas have experienced periods of economic decline 
we may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis  or on acceptable terms 
our ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors  including general economic conditions affecting these markets our own financial structure and performance the market opinion of reits in general the market opinion of reits that own properties similar to ours we may suffer adverse effects as a result of the terms of and covenants relating to our indebtedness 
required payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of our portfolio of properties declines 
if the economic performance of our properties declines  net income  cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to shareholders will be reduced 
if payments on debt cannot be made  we could sustain a loss  or in the case of mortgages  suffer foreclosures by mortgagees or suffer judgments 
further  some obligations  including our million credit facility and billion in unsecured notes issued in past public offerings  contain cross default and or cross acceleration provisions at december   which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations 
our credit facility and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness  including total debt to asset ratios  secured debt to total asset ratios  debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt which we must maintain 
our continued ability to borrow under our million credit facility is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants 
in addition  our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under this credit facility  and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources 
under those circumstances  other sources of capital may not be available to us  or be available only on unattractive terms 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 
our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes 
our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies 
however  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain this rating  and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating  we would likely incur higher borrowing costs 
our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities to finance future developments  acquisitions  or repay indebtedness 
our board of trustees can authorize the issuance of additional securities without shareholder approval 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including 
table of contents unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including issuances of common and preferred equity 
an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt 
we currently have  and may incur more  indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  if interest rates increase  so will our interest costs  which would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
further  rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures 
property ownership through joint ventures will limit our ability to act exclusively in our interests and may require us to depend on the financial performance of our co venturers 
from time to time we invest in joint ventures in which we do not hold a controlling interest 
these investments involve risks that do not exist with properties in which we own a controlling interest  including the possibility that our partners may  at any time  have business  economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives 
in instances where we lack a controlling interest  our partners may be in a position to require action that is contrary to our objectives 
while we seek to negotiate the terms of these joint ventures in a way that secures our ability to act in our best interests  there can be no assurance that those terms will be sufficient to fully protect us against actions contrary to our interests 
if the objectives of our co ventures are inconsistent with ours  we may not in every case be able to act exclusively in our interests 
additionally  our joint venture partners may experience financial difficulties or change their investment philosophies 
this may impair their ability to meet their obligations to the joint venture  such as with respect to providing additional capital  if required 
if such a circumstance presented itself we may be required to perform on their behalf  if possible  or suffer a loss of all or a portion of our investment in the joint venture 
risks related to the real estate industry real estate investments are illiquid  and we may not be able to sell our properties if and when we determine it is appropriate to do so 
real estate generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to dispose of our properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
in addition  provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  limit a reit ability to sell properties in some situations when it may be economically advantageous to do so  thereby adversely affecting returns to shareholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations to the holders of other securities 
we may experience economic harm if any damage to our properties is not covered by insurance 
we believe all of our properties are adequately insured with carriers that are adequately capitalized 
however  we cannot guarantee that the limits of our current policies will be sufficient in the event of a catastrophe to our properties or that carriers will be able to honor their obligations 
our existing property and liability policies expire during we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew or duplicate our current coverages in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices 
we may suffer losses that are not covered under our comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance policies 
for example  we may not be insured for losses resulting from acts of war  certain acts of terrorism  or from environmental liabilities 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur  we would nevertheless remain liable for the loss which could adversely affect cash flow from operations 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate 
if unidentified environmental problems arise  we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders because as owner or operator  we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination the law typically imposes clean up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination  each person who shares legal liability under the 
table of contents environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs these costs could be substantial 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
in addition  applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties may result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties 
these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas  an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state  federal and historical documents  but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling 
where appropriate  on a property by property basis  our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing  including sampling for asbestos  for lead in drinking water  for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usages create a potential environmental problem  and for contamination in groundwater 
even though these environmental assessments are conducted  there is still the risk that the environmental assessments and updates will not identify all potential environmental liabilities a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us while we test indoor air quality on a regular basis and have an ongoing maintenance program in place to address this aspect of property operations  inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and  depending on the results  remediation 
indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources  pollen  viruses and bacteria 
indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals 
if these conditions were to occur at one of our properties  we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program  including without limitation  steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants 
such remediation programs could be costly  necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property 
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property 
in addition  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely impact our operating results 
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act ada 
the ada generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers  and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the united states government or an award of damages to private litigants  or both 
expenditures related to complying with the provisions of the ada could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely impact our operating results and may affect markets on which our securities are traded 

table of contents terrorist attacks against our properties  or against the united states or united states interests generally  may negatively affect our operations and investments in our securities 
attacks or armed conflicts could have a direct adverse impact on our properties or operations through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs 
any terrorism insurance that we obtain may be insufficient to cover the loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks 
furthermore  any terrorist attacks or armed conflicts could result in increased volatility in or damage to the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
risks related to our organization and structure we have elected reit status under the federal tax laws and could suffer adverse consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit 
we have elected reit status under federal tax laws and have taken the steps known to us to perfect that status  but we cannot be certain that we qualify or that we will remain qualified 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code  as to which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the related income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets in partnership form  as we do 
moreover  no assurance can be given that new tax laws will not significantly affect our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
new laws could be applied retroactively  which means that past operations could be found to be in violation  which would have a negative effect on the business 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the distributions to shareholders would not be deductible when computing taxable income 
if this happened  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
also  we could be prevented from qualifying as a reit for the four years following the year in which we were disqualified 
further  if we requalified as a reit after failing to qualify  we might have to pay the full corporate level tax on any unrealized gain in our assets during the period we were not qualified as a reit 
we would then have to distribute to our shareholders the earnings we accumulated while we were not qualified as a reit 
these additional taxes would reduce our funds available for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  while we were disqualified as a reit  we would not be required by the code to make distributions to our shareholders 
a failure by the company to qualify as a reit and the resulting requirement to pay taxes and interest and perhaps penalties would cause us to default under various agreements to which we are a party  including under our credit facility  and would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations  earnings  financial condition and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may lead our board of trustees to authorize the revocation of our election to qualify as a reit 
a revocation of our reit status would require the consent of the holders of a majority of the voting interests of all of our outstanding common shares 
certain officers of the trust may not have the same interests as shareholders as to certain tax laws 
certain officers of the trust own common units 
these units may be exchanged for our common shares 
the officers who own those units and have not yet exchanged them for our common shares may suffer different and more adverse tax consequences than holders of our common shares suffer in certain situations when certain of our properties are sold when debt on those properties is refinanced if we are involved in a tender offer or merger because these officers own units and face different consequences than shareholders do  the trust and those officers may have different objectives as to these transactions than shareholders do 
certain aspects of our organization could have the effect of restricting or preventing a change of control of our company  which could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares 
our charter contains an ownership limit on shares 
to qualify as a reit  five or fewer individuals cannot own  directly or indirectly  more than in value of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest 
to this end  our declaration of trust  among other things  generally prohibits any holder of the trust shares from owning more than of the trust outstanding shares of beneficial interest  unless that holder gets the consent from our board of trustees 
this limitation could prevent the acquisition of control of the company by a third party without the consent from our board of trustees 
we can issue preferred shares 
our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued 
the issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying  making more difficult or preventing a 
table of contents change of control of the company  even if a change in control were in the shareholder interest 
there are limitations on acquisition of and changes in control pursuant to  and fiduciary protections of the board under maryland law 
the maryland general corporation law mgcl contains provisions which are applicable to the trust as if the trust were a corporation 
among these provisions is a section  referred to as the control share acquisition statute  which eliminates the voting rights of shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under the mgcl 
the mgcl also contains provisions applicable to us that are referred to as the business combination statute  which would generally limit business combinations between the company and any owners of the trust shares or any affiliate thereof 
further  maryland law provides broad discretion to the board with respect to its fiduciary duties in considering a change in control of our company  including that the board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other act by the board 
finally  the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the mgcl permit the board  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or by laws  to implement takeover defenses that our company does not yet have  including permitting only the board to fix the size of the board and permitting only the board to fill a vacancy on the board 
all of these provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price 
various factors out of our control could hurt the market value of our publicly traded securities 
the value of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions  which may change from time to time 
in addition to general economic and market conditions and our particular financial condition and performance  the value of our publicly traded securities could be affected by  among other things  the extent of institutional investor interest in us and the market opinion of reits in general and  in particular  reits that own and operate properties similar to ours 
the market value of the equity securities of a reit may be based primarily upon the market perception of the reit growth potential and its current and future cash distributions  and may be secondarily based upon factors such as the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
the failure to meet the market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would adversely affect the market price of publicly traded securities 
our payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on numerous factors including our cash flow  financial condition and capital requirements  annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code  the general economic environment and such other factors as our board of trustees deems relevant  and we cannot assure you that our annual dividend rate will be maintained at its current level 
we are currently distributing more in dividends than we receive in net cash provided by operating activities less customary tenant improvement and leasing transaction costs 
over time  increases in occupancy and rental rates could offset this shortfall 
should market opportunities allow us to accelerate our strategy relating to dispositions ie  sale of suburban office without corresponding opportunities to reinvest those proceeds in the near term  this shortfall would increase 
we will continually evaluate these circumstances opposite our distribution policies 
rising market interest rates could make an investment in publicly traded securities less attractive 
if market interest rates increase  purchasers of publicly traded securities may demand a higher annual yield on the price they pay for their securities 
this could adversely affect the market price of publicly traded securities 
furthermore  changes in tax laws may affect the price of our securities 
pursuant to legislation newly enacted in  the highest marginal ordinary income tax rate is and the highest long term capital gain rate is  in addition  the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations in with respect to the foreign account tax compliance act  adopting the effective dates for required withholding provided for in previous irs guidance 
while we do not expect that the new legislation and irs regulations to have any significant impact on our operations and financial results  no assurance can be given that additional new tax laws will not adversely affect the value of our publicly traded securities 
we no longer have a shareholder rights plan but are not precluded from adopting one 
our shareholder rights plan expired in accordance with its terms on december  while we did not extend or renew the plan  we are not prohibited from adopting  without shareholder approval  a shareholder rights plan that may discourage any potential acquirer from acquiring more than a specific percentage of our outstanding common shares since  upon this type of acquisition without approval of our board of trustees  all other common shareholders would have the right to purchase a specified amount of common shares at a substantial discount from market price 
transactions by the trust or the operating partnership could adversely affect debt holders 
except with respect to several covenants limiting the incurrence of indebtedness and a covenant requiring the operating partnership 
table of contents to maintain a certain unencumbered total asset value  our indentures do not contain any additional provisions that would protect holders of the operating partnership debt securities in the event of i a highly leveraged transaction involving the operating partnership  ii a change of control or iii certain reorganizations  restructurings  mergers or similar transactions involving the operating partnership or the trust

the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has issued a standard definition for funds from operations as defined below 
the securities and exchange commission has agreed to the disclosure of this non gaap financial measure on a per share basis in its release no 
 conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
the company believes that the calculation of funds from operations is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the company operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions 
as a result  year over year comparison of funds from operations reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses  and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  management believes that funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about the company financial performance when compared to other reits since funds from operations is generally recognized as the standard for reporting the operating performance of a reit 
funds from operations available to common shareholders is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
funds from operations available to common shareholders does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations available to common shareholders also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
historically the company included impairment charges in this computation 
however  excluding impairment charges from the computation of funds from operations is consistent with nareit reaffirmation in november of its july guidance on nareit defined funds from operations  which indicated that impairment write downs of depreciable real estate should be excluded in the computation of funds from operations 
accordingly  funds from operations have been restated for prior periods 
a reconciliation of funds from operations to net income may be found in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

indicators the company uses to determine whether an impairment evaluation is necessary include the low occupancy level of the property  holding period for the property  strategic decisions regarding future development plans for a property under development and land held for development and other market factors 
if impairment indicators are present  the company performs an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compares the net carrying amount of the property to the property estimated undiscounted future cash flow over the anticipated holding period 
the company assesses the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  current market rental rates  changes in market rental rates  operating costs  capitalization rates and holding periods 
for these assumptions  the company considers its experience and historical performance in the various markets and data provided by market research organizations 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on the discounting of future expected cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively 
the determination of whether an impairment exists requires the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions about the future cash flows 
intangibles the company allocates the purchase price of real estate acquired to land  building and improvements and intangibles based on the fair value of each component 
the value ascribed to in place leases is based on the rental rates for the existing leases compared to the company estimate of the fair market lease rates for leases of similar terms and present valuing the difference based on an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired

such amounts are also included in origination costs 
the company depreciates the amounts allocated to building and improvements over years 
the amounts allocated to the intangible relating to in place leases  which are included in deferred financing and leasing costs or in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  are amortized to rental income for market rental rate differences and to depreciation and amortization for origination costs on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the related leases 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the intangible is written off 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company analyzes its investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence over  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 
management estimated the fair value of its ownership interest in the joint ventures considering the estimated fair value of the real estate assets owned by the joint ventures and the related indebtedness as well as the working capital assets and liabilities of the joint ventures and the terms of the related joint venture agreements 
the company estimates of fair value of the real estate assets 
table of contents are based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  current market rental rates  changes in market rental rates  operating costs  capitalization rates  holding periods and discount rates 
for these assumptions  the company considered its experience and historical performance in the various markets and data provided by market research organizations 
in assessing whether an impairment is other than temporary  the company considers several factors 
the longevity and severity of the impairment are considered as well as the expected time for recovery of value to occur  if ever 
the company determined that one investment in a joint venture had an other than temporary impairment of  during the year ended december  no impairment losses on the company investments in unconsolidated joint ventures were recognized during the years ended december  or during the year ended december  the blythe valley jv sarl joint venture recorded an impairment charge  the company share of which was sufficient to bring the company investment in the joint venture to zero

calculation of funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has issued a standard definition for funds from operations as defined below 
the sec has agreed to the disclosure of this non gaap financial measure on a per share basis in its release no 
 conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
the company believes that the calculation of funds from operations is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the company s operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from operating property dispositions 
as a result  year over year comparison of funds from operations reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses  and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  management believes that funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about the company s financial performance when compared to other reits since funds from operations is generally recognized as the standard for reporting the operating performance of a reit 
funds from operations available to common shareholders is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
funds from operations available to common shareholders does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations available to common shareholders also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
historically the company included impairment charges in this computation 
however  excluding impairment charges from the computation of funds from operations is consistent with nareit reaffirmation in november of its july guidance on nareit defined funds from operations  which indicated that impairment write downs of depreciable real estate should be excluded in the computation of funds from operations 
accordingly  funds from operations have been restated for prior periods

to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as insurance  real estate taxes and utilities  the majority of the tenants leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued interest  dividends 
table of contents and distributions payable and other liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments 
the fair value of the company long term debt  which is based on estimates by management and on rates quoted on december  for comparable loans  is greater than the aggregate carrying value by approximately million at december  the company primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company interest expense would have increased or decreased by million 
if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company interest expense would have increased or decreased by  the sensitivity analysis above assumes no changes in the company financial structure 
it also does not consider future fluctuations in interest rates or the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on its net investment in the united kingdom 
the company does not believe that this currency risk exposure is material to its financial statements
