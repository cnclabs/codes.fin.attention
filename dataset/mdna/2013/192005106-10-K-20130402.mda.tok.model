table of contents codexyme cellulase enzymes many of the fuels and chemicals that are in use today are derived from non renewable petroleum resources 
codexyme cellulase enzymes allow these same fuels and chemicals to be made from renewable resources  such as cellulosic biomass 
fuels and chemicals produced from these types of materials and wastes are known as second generation  next generation  or cellulosic products 
today  cellulosic fuels and chemicals are not widely manufactured at commercial scale because their unit production economics have not yet been shown to be competitive with incumbent petroleum based fuels and chemicals 
we believe that codexyme cellulase enzymes may help drive competitive production economics for cellulosic fuels and chemicals  thereby enabling their integration into global commodity markets 
codexyme cellulase enzymes function by transforming cellulosic biomass into sugars  a process known as saccharification 
the resulting sugars from saccharification can be converted into fuels and chemicals through fermentation 
our goal is to make codexyme cellulase enzymes the leader in the cellulase enzyme category 
as described in more detail below under collaborations and license agreements shell  our existing collaboration with equilon enterprises llc dba shell oil products us  or shell  for the commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes in the fuels market terminated in august as a result of the termination of the shell collaboration  we initiated a series of cost reduction measures and refocused our business on the pharmaceuticals market 
we terminated approximately employees worldwide  consisting of research and development staff and general and administrative staff 
we also closed our singapore research and development facility 
we are seeking new collaboration partners to assist us with the development and commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes 
moving forward with partners should allow us to focus on our primary competitive strength  which we believe is our ability to optimize the performance of codexyme cellulase enzymes rapidly for varying feedstocks and process conditions 
we are also exploring other strategic options for our codexyme cellulase enzyme technologies 
codexol detergent alcohols we are also developing microorganisms that produce chemicals from cellulosic sugars 
these microorganisms function as mini fermentation factories that convert sugars into specialty or commodity chemicals 
our first chemical development initiative is our bio based codexol detergent alcohols program 
detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  an active ingredient in consumer products  such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
the annual global market for detergent alcohols is approximately billion  which represents approximately million metric tons with an average selling price  or asp  of approximately  per ton today 
major consumer products companies such as procter gamble  unilever and henkel purchase or produce a majority of the surfactants derived from detergent alcohols 
currently  detergent alcohols are manufactured using two alternative processes 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using vegetable oils  such as palm  kernel and coconut oils  is known as the oleochemical production route 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using ethylene is known as the petrochemical production route 
we believe that our codexol detergent alcohols process  by using cellulosic sugars  has the potential to offer attractive production economics compared to incumbent oleochemical and petrochemical production routes 
we are developing our fully integrated cellulosic codexol detergent alcohols manufacturing process  from feedstock to product  in collaboration with chemtex 
we believe that our codexol detergent alcohols process may be used with a wide variety of cellulosic biomass  including sugarcane bagasse  wheat straw  corn stover and various energy crops such as arundo donax 
we believe that this process has the potential to decrease the manufacturing costs of codexol detergent alcohols below current incumbent production costs 
we also believe that in comparison to using oleochemical and petrochemical production routes  the raw materials of which raise concerns regarding deforestation  climate change and other environmental impacts  using codexol detergent alcohols in their manufacturing process would better enable major consumer products companies to achieve their sustainability and corporate social responsibility goals 
one example of such corporate social responsibility goal is the sustainable living plan announced by unilever  under which unilever is committed to sourcing of its agricultural raw materials sustainably by we are seeking additional collaboration partners to assist us with the development and commercialization of codexol detergent alcohols 
we are also exploring other strategic options for our codexol detergent alcohols technologies 

table of contents our strategy continue growing our pharmaceutical business 
we intend to pursue new collaborations in the pharmaceutical industry to integrate our products and services more deeply into drug development and manufacturing processes for clinical stage and commercially approved pharmaceutical products 
as part of that effort  we will continue to market our codex biocatalyst panels and our codex biocatalyst kits aggressively to pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate the capabilities of our technology platform 
seek partners to invest in our codexyme cellulase enzyme and codexol detergent alcohol programs  or identify and effect other strategic options with respect to those programs 
we are currently in the process of identifying potential partners for our codexyme cellulase enzyme and codexol detergent alcohol programs so that we can leverage our partners engineering  manufacturing or commercial expertise  their distribution infrastructure and their ability to fund commercial scale production facilities 
this capital light partnership model would enable us to commercialize these projects without requiring significant additional capital from us 
we are also exploring other strategic options for these programs 
explore commercial opportunities by leveraging our existing enzyme optimization technology 
we intend to employ our existing enzyme optimization technology to explore new business opportunities  including in the fine chemical market 
the fine chemicals market is similar to our pharmaceutical ingredients business and consists of several large market segments that we will explore for new business opportunities 
additionally  we intend to employ our existing enzyme optimization technology to develop improved therapeutic enzymes for our pharmaceutical customers improve our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform 
we intend to continue to improve our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform  which may allow us to maintain a technology advantage over our customers and competitors 
improving our core technology capabilities should allow us to reduce the cost and time to develop new products for our customers 
our pharmaceutical products and services our opportunity in the pharmaceutical market the pharmaceutical industry continues to represent a significant market opportunity for us  and has become our primary business focus since the termination of the shell collaboration 
pharmaceutical companies are now under significant competitive pressure both to reduce costs and to increase the speed to market for their products 
to meet these pressures  pharmaceutical companies seek manufacturing processes for their new and existing drugs that reduce overall costs  simplify production and increase efficiency and product yield  while not affecting drug safety and efficacy 
in addition  for products whose patents have expired  the importance of cost reduction is even higher  as the pharmaceutical manufacturers that developed those patent protected drugs  known as innovators  compete with generics manufacturers 
the pharmaceutical product lifecycle begins with the discovery of new chemical entities and continues through preclinical and clinical development  product launch and  ultimately  patent expiration and the transition from branded to generic products 
as innovators develop  produce and then market products  manufacturing priorities and processes evolve 
historically  innovators have focused on production cost reduction in the later stages of clinical development and have been reluctant to make process changes after a product has been launched 
however  as pressures to reduce costs have increased  innovators have pursued cost reduction measures much earlier in the pharmaceutical product lifecycle and are increasingly looking for opportunities to improve their operating margins  including making manufacturing process changes for marketed products after the products have been launched if these changes can result in significant cost reductions 
as a result  innovators are investing in new technologies to improve their manufacturing productivity and efficiency or outsourcing the manufacture of their intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis 
our solution for the pharmaceutical market our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform enables us to deliver solutions to our customers in the pharmaceutical market by developing and delivering optimized enzymes that perform chemical transformations at a lower cost and improve the efficiency and productivity of manufacturing processes 
we provide value throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle 
our pharmaceutical products and services allow us to provide benefits to our customers in a number of ways  including reducing the use of raw materials and intermediate products  reducing the number of processing steps  
table of contents improving product yield  using water as a primary solvent  performing reactions at or near room temperature and pressure  eliminating the need for certain costly manufacturing equipment  reducing energy requirements  reducing the need for late stage purification steps  eliminating multiple steps in the manufacturing process  and eliminating hazardous inputs and harmful emission by products 
early in the product lifecycle  customers can use our products and services to achieve speed to market and to reduce manufacturing costs 
if an innovator incorporates our products or processes into an fda approved product  we expect the innovator to continue to use these products or processes over the patent life of the approved drug 
after a product is launched  customers also use our products and services to reduce manufacturing costs 
at this stage  changes in the manufacturing process originally approved by the fda may require additional review 
typically  pharmaceutical companies will only seek fda approval for a manufacturing change if there are substantial cost savings associated with the change 
we believe that the cost savings associated with our products may lead our customers to change their manufacturing processes for approved products and  if necessary  seek fda approval of the new processes which incorporate our enzymes 
moreover  we believe these cost savings are attractive to generics manufacturers  who compete primarily on price 
products and services codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
we sell codex biocatalyst panels and kits to customers who are engaged in both drug development and the marketing of approved drugs to allow them to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes for their drug candidates and their marketed products 
codex biocatalyst panels are tools that provide genetically diverse variants of our proprietary enzymes  which allow our customers to determine whether an enzyme produces a desired activity that is applicable to a particular process 
codex biocatalyst kits provide subsets of the panel enzymes in individual vials for the same purpose 
for compounds that are in development  codex biocatalyst panels and kits allow innovators to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes rapidly and inexpensively for many of their drug candidates in house  without the risks of disclosing the composition of their proprietary molecules before they have received patent protection  and generate data that we can use to optimize enzymes rapidly for a particular reaction  if necessary  reducing the time required to generate a manufacturing process capable of supporting clinical trials with inexpensively produced  pure drugs 
we believe that our codex biocatalyst panels and kits have helped us build early and broad awareness of the power and utility of our technology platform  and will increasingly lead to sales of our enzymes and enzyme optimization services  as well as intermediates and apis made using our enzymes 
over customers  including leading pharmaceutical companies such as teva  merck  novartis and pfizer  have used our panels and kits 
if our customers incorporate an enzymatic manufacturing process early in a product lifecycle  they can reduce their manufacturing costs throughout that lifecycle  while we  in turn  could realize a long term revenue stream resulting from the use of our enzymes during that time 
in addition  codex biocatalyst panels and kits are increasingly used by our customers to evaluate the feasibility of changing the manufacturing process for their marketed products to an enzyme enabled process 
enzyme screening services 
if a customer prefers  rather than subscribing to our codex biocatalyst panels or kits to use for their own screening  they can send us their materials to test against our existing libraries of enzymes 
if we detect desired activity in a specific enzyme  we can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform optimization services to improve the performance of the enzyme 

table of contents our screening services allow innovators to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes rapidly and inexpensively through access to our extensive enzyme libraries  and generate data that we can use to optimize enzymes rapidly for a particular reaction  if necessary  reducing the time required to generate a manufacturing process capable of supporting the customers particular needs  ranging from small quantities for clinical trials to full commercial production  in all cases providing inexpensively produced  pure drugs 
we have provided screening services to numerous innovator and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers 
enzyme optimization services 
we work with our customers throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle to customize enzymes  resulting in optimized enzymes that have been evolved specifically to perform a desired process according to a highly selective set of specifications 
our enzyme optimization services allow innovators to improve the manufacturing process as their drug candidates progress through preclinical and clinical development  in some cases deferring or reducing the need for significant manufacturing investment until the likelihood of commercial success is more certain  and enable manufacturing processes that are highly efficient  inexpensive  require relatively little energy  reduce the need for hazardous reagents and reduce waste 
for example  our activities with pfizer have included developing an optimized enzymatic manufacturing process for a key intermediate that eliminates three chemical steps from the conventional chemical manufacturing process 
enzymes 
we supply varying quantities of our enzymes to pharmaceutical companies  from small to moderate quantities while they are optimizing their production processes  to larger quantities during later stage clinical development and commercial scale drug production 
our enzymes enable innovators to manufacture products more efficiently during preclinical and clinical development using optimized enzymatic processes  with relatively low investment  eliminate the need for innovators to invest in the development of complex chemical synthesis routes during the development stage  allow innovators to achieve higher product purity during the development stage prior to investing in expensive late stage clinical trials  reduce the risk of adverse effects arising from product impurities  allow the removal of entire steps from synthetic chemical production routes during commercial scale production  reducing raw material costs  energy requirements and the need for capital expenditures  and decrease the manufacturing costs for our customers 
for instance  as a part of our ongoing collaboration with merck  we have developed an enzyme for use in a new manufacturing process for sitagliptin  the api in merck pharmaceutical product januvia 
januvia is merck first in class medication for the treatment of type ii diabetes 
we have also entered into agreements with several leading contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos  including royal dsm nv  or dsm  dishman pharmaceuticals and chemicals  ltd  and ampac  under which these cmos can use our enzymes in their manufacturing processes 
intermediates and apis 
we can supply our customers with intermediates and apis made using our enzymes throughout the drug lifecycle 
our supply of intermediates has the following uses and benefits lowers capital investment for innovators through outsourcing of manufacturing  and provides a source of less expensive  more pure products to innovator and generics manufacturers 

table of contents we developed a key intermediate for boceprevir  which is merck hepatitis c drug 
we have also developed enzymes for use in the manufacture of certain generic intermediates and apis by various companies  including arch pharmalabs limited  or arch  and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  or teva 
in addition  we market several intermediates and apis for the generic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products for sale in markets where innovators have not sought patent protection for their products and intend to sell these same intermediates and apis for use in markets where innovators have sought patent protection when the patent protection for each product expires 
for the years ended december   and  revenues for our statin family of products contributed approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues and our sales of products used in hepatitis c therapies were approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues for those periods 
pharmaceutical business model we typically enter into research collaborations with our pharmaceutical customers 
these agreements often contain service and intellectual property provisions under which we research and develop optimized enzymes for innovator pharmaceutical companies in connection with their drug development efforts 
in these collaborations  we typically receive revenues in the form of one or more of the following up front payments  milestone payments  payments based upon the number of full time employee equivalents  or ftes  engaged in related research and development activities and licensing fees and royalties 
our pharmaceutical products include enzymes  pharmaceutical intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  and codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
we sell our products primarily to pharmaceutical manufacturers through our direct sales and business development force in the united states and europe 
our codexyme cellulase enzyme program industry overview the global economy is heavily dependent on petroleum 
many of the fuels and chemicals that are used throughout the world are derived from non renewable petroleum and concerns about the long term supply of petroleum and its price volatility have increased the desire to find renewable alternatives to this limited commodity 
many fuels and chemicals manufactures are looking for alternatives to non renewable petroleum  including cellulosic biomass  as a feedstock for their products 
fuels and chemicals derived from corn starch  sugar cane or plant oils are called first generation products and those derived from cellulosic biomass such as corn stover  wheat straw and sugar cane bagasse are known as second generation  next generation or cellulosic products 
in order to produce a cellulosic product using fermentation  a manufacturer must first pretreat the cellulosic biomass and then introduce cellulase enzymes into the manufacturing process 
together  these steps work to break down the cellulose and hemicellulose found in the cell walls of the cellulosic biomass into sugars 
this process is commonly referred to as saccharification 
these sugars can then be converted into biofuels and chemicals through fermentation 
producing second generation fuels and chemicals is a more complicated process than producing first generation products 
as a result  most biofuel and bio based chemical manufacturers have chosen to develop and commercialize first generation products 
sources of cellulosic biomass vary greatly by plant species and geographic region 
one of the challenges for manufacturing cellulosic products is the need for technology that can convert the vast array of cellulosic biomass found throughout the world into fermentable sugars 
solving this challenge requires cellulosic biofuels and chemicals manufacturers to develop innovative  robust cellulase enzymes that have greater product yield  are more cost effective  and react quickly and continually under industrial conditions 
we do not believe that anyone has successfully accomplished this goal cost effectively and at commercial scale 
codexyme cellulase enzymes we believe that codexyme cellulase enzymes will enable the production of cellulosic fuels and bio based chemicals cost effectively and at commercial scale and that they may help drive competitive production economics for cellulosic fuels and chemicals  thereby enabling their integration into global commodity markets 
codexyme cellulase enzymes have the potential to convert a wide variety of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars  an important feature because the cellulosic biomass that we expect will be used to produce cellulosic products is highly variable from region to region and can change over time 
for example  codexyme cellulase enzymes convert both sugar cane bagasse and wheat straw to fermentable sugars 
in addition  we licensed a commercial scale enzyme production system from dyadic international  inc  or dyadic  in that we expect will enable the cost effective production of codexyme cellulase enzymes 
we believe that the combination of our high performing codexyme cellulase enzymes and the ability to produce these cellulase enzymes cost effectively at commercial 
table of contents scale  will enable us to develop a scalable  global platform that will provide us and our customers a competitive advantage in the cellulosic products market 
we collaborated with shell to develop codexyme cellulase enzymes from november through august when this collaboration ended in august  we no longer received funding from shell for development of codexyme cellulase enzymes 
as a result  we reduced the scope of our development activities for this project  refocused our business on the pharmaceuticals market and initiated a series of cost reduction measures  including employee terminations and the closure of our singapore research and development facility 
we are now seeking new collaboration partners to assist us with the development and commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes 
moving forward with partners should allow us to focus on our primary competitive strength  which we believe is our ability to optimize the performance of codexyme cellulase enzymes rapidly for varying feedstocks and process conditions 
we are also exploring other strategic options for our codexyme cellulase enzyme program 
our codexol detergent alcohols program industry overview detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  a key  active cleaning ingredient in consumer products such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate are two such common surfactants 
the annual global market for detergent alcohols is approximately billion  which represents approximately million metric tons with an asp of approximately  per ton 
major consumer products companies  such as procter gamble  unilever and henkel  purchase or produce a majority of the surfactants made from detergent alcohols 
currently  detergent alcohols are manufactured using two alternative processes 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using vegetable oils  such as palm  kernel and coconut oils  is known as the oleochemical production route 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using ethylene is known as the petrochemical production route 
the production economics of traditional detergent alcohol manufacturing routes are primarily based on the market prices of their respective feedstocks 
both ethylene and palm kernel oil prices have risen considerably in recent years  leading to a significant rise in the price of detergent alcohols 
between and  global detergent alcohol prices rose from  per ton to over  per ton  and in early  prices higher than approximately  per ton were observed for the first time in recent history before returning back to the  per ton range 
in addition to price volatility  consumer products companies face sustainability and corporate social responsibility issues with traditional detergent alcohols 
the oleochemical route  which as of accounted for over two thirds of global detergent alcohol production  has led to concerns of deforestation due to the rapid expansion of palm oil plantations to meet growing demand 
the petrochemical route uses petroleum based ethylene manufacturing processes that are also considered unsustainable 
many major consumer products companies today have adopted corporate social responsibility platforms in which they have pledged to their customers and stockholders that they will use sustainable  socially responsible materials in their commercial products 
for example unilever sustainable living plan sets specific goals including halving the environmental footprint of the company products and sourcing of the company agricultural raw materials sustainably 
procter gamble environmental sustainability vision includes using renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging  and designing products that appeal to customers while maximizing conservation of resources 
codexol detergent alcohols codexol detergent alcohols can act as a drop in substitute for over of the estimated billion detergent alcohol market 
we expect that codexol detergent alcohols will offer advantages in feedstock price volatility and sustainability when compared to traditional detergent alcohols 
we are developing our codexol detergent alcohols manufacturing process  from feedstock to end product  in collaboration with chemtex 
chemtex has licensed to us  on an exclusive basis in the field of detergent alcohols  its proesa pretreatment technology  which we are integrating with codexyme cellulase enzymes to create fermentable sugars 
our proprietary microorganism will then convert these sugars into codexol detergent alcohols 
we have agreed to use the proesa pretreatment technology exclusively to produce codexol detergent alcohols 
similarly  chemtex has agreed to work exclusively with us in the production of cellulosic detergent alcohols 
we expect that chemtex will pilot this manufacturing process using codexyme cellulase enzymes and their proesa pretreatment technology in chemtex will provide 
table of contents engineering services for the design and construction of our commercial facilities for the production of codexol detergent alcohols and we will market products resulting from the collaboration 
codexol detergent alcohols are manufactured using a process which is amenable to various types of cellulosic biomass  including sugarcane bagasse  wheat straw  corn stover and various energy crops such as arundo donax 
we believe that this process has the potential to lower codexol detergent alcohols manufacturing costs and make them less volatile than current incumbent manufacturing costs 
additionally  codexol detergent alcohols are better aligned with the sustainability and corporate social responsibility goals of major consumer products companies  like unilever and procter gamble  since it is sourced from sustainable and renewable cellulosic biomass 
we are seeking additional collaboration partners to assist us with the development and commercialization of codexol detergent alcohols 
we are also exploring other strategic options for our codexol detergent alcohols technology 
collaborations and license agreements we believe that collaborations allow us to develop our products while operating our business with maximum capital efficiency 
for example  by collaborating with arch  we are able to leverage both our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform and arch strengths in production and distribution 
this allows us to focus our capital on key areas such as research and development 
arch we are collaborating with arch of mumbai  india in the supply of enzymes used in the manufacture and sale of certain specified apis  and intermediates used in the manufacture of apis  such as the api in atorvastatin 
arch has extensive expertise in chemical process development and scale up  and is a leading producer of intermediates and generic apis in india 
on november   we entered into an enzyme supply agreement with arch  or the new arch enzyme supply agreement  in which arch agreed to exclusively purchase enzymes from us for use in the manufacture of certain of arch products and we agreed to exclusively supply  with limited exceptions  certain of our proprietary enzymes to arch at an agreed upon price for use in such manufacture 
the exclusivity may expire in certain circumstances  including if arch fails to purchase a specified minimum quantity of enzymes from us 
under the terms of the new arch enzyme supply agreement  arch has an obligation to use commercially reasonably efforts to market the products covered under the agreement to its customers 
we have agreed not to buy or source any of the covered products from anyone other than arch and have agreed not to sell any covered products to any of arch customers 
the new arch enzyme supply agreement terminates on february   unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties or unless terminated at an earlier date in accordance with the termination provisions contained in the agreement 
the new arch enzyme supply agreement replaced four of our prior agreements with arch the enzyme and product supply agreement  effective as of february   as amended  the memorandum of understanding for transfer pricing and royalty calculation  effective as of february   as amended  the product supply agreement  effective as of february   as amended and the memorandum of understanding for transfer pricing  effective as of february   as amended 
these four terminated agreements are referred to as the prior arch supply agreements 
the prior arch supply agreements provided that the company would supply arch with enzymes at an agreed upon price  and arch would in turn manufacture certain apis  or intermediates used in the manufacture of apis  using those enzymes and would supply such apis or intermediates to the company at a formula based or agreed upon price 
the company had the exclusive right to sell such apis or intermediates to innovator pharmaceutical companies worldwide  generic pharmaceutical companies in the united states  canada  europe and israel  and certain pharmaceutical companies in india 
arch had the exclusive right to manufacture  market and sell such apis or intermediates to generic pharmaceutical companies in countries other than the united states  canada  europe and israel  and certain other pharmaceutical companies in india 
under this collaboration  arch owed a license royalty to us based on the volume of product they sold to us or the customers to which it sold product directly 
royalties earned from arch under this arrangement were  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
with the termination of the prior arch supply agreements  arch will no longer produce apis and intermediates for us and will no longer pay us royalties on the sale of apis and intermediates to customers  and we will no longer have exclusive rights to market such apis and intermediates in certain markets 
dyadic we have acquired access to a fungal expression system that is capable of producing enzymes at commercial scale through a license agreement with dyadic and its affiliate in november under the license agreement with dyadic  we obtained a non exclusive license relating to dyadic proprietary fungal expression technology for the production of enzymes 
we can use these enzymes to make products in the fields of biofuels  certain pharmaceuticals  chemicals  air treatment  water treatment and 
table of contents the conversion of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars for use in non fuel products 
we also obtained access to specified materials of dyadic relating to this technology 
our license is sublicenseable to shell in the field of biofuels  and sublicenseable to third parties in the non biofuels fields of certain pharmaceuticals  chemicals  air treatment  water treatment and the conversion of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars for non fuel products 
each party agreed that neither it nor its affiliates or sublicensees will assert any claim of infringement of any patent covering improvements to the dyadic materials that were made by that party or its affiliates or sublicensees against the other party  or its affiliates  sublicensees  successors  distributors  or customers 
we agreed to pay dyadic certain license issuance fees  milestone payments  and fees based on volume of enzyme products sold or manufactured using this dyadic technology 
we have the right to terminate the license agreement at will upon notice after payment of the license issuance fees 
either party has the right to terminate the license agreement for a material breach of the other party that is uncured within a period of time after notice 
dyadic has the right to terminate our licenses under the license agreement if we challenge the validity of any of the patents licensed under the license agreement 
our licenses  and access to dyadic materials  under the license agreement will terminate as a result of any termination of the license agreement other than due to dyadic material breach 
shell from november to august  we collaborated with shell to develop commercially viable fuels from cellulosic biomass 
in this collaboration  we agreed to use our proprietary technology platform to discover and develop enzymes and microorganisms for use in converting cellulosic biomass into biofuels and related products 
shell had an obligation to fund us at specified rates for each full time employee equivalent  or fte  which as of were equal to  on an annual basis for each fte in the united states and  on an annual basis for each fte in hungary 
as of august   the number of ftes assigned by us to perform our obligations under the research agreement was for the year ended december   shell accounted for of our total revenues 
in september  we entered into a license agreement  or the new shell agreement  with shell

technology we engineer custom enzymes and microorganisms  which we sometimes refer to as biocatalysts 
in simple terms  our enzymes and microorganisms initiate or accelerate chemical reactions 
we use our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform  which includes enzyme engineering  metabolic pathway engineering and fermentation microbe improvement  to develop novel enzymes and microorganisms that enable industrial biocatalytic reactions and fermentations 
our technology platform has enabled commercially viable products and processes for the manufacture of pharmaceutical intermediates  and we apply our technology platform to develop codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohols 
our approach to developing commercially viable biocatalytic processes begins by conceptually designing the most cost effective and practical manufacturing process for a targeted product 
we then develop optimized biocatalysts to enable that process design  using our directed evolution technology  including screening and validating biocatalysts under relevant conditions 
typical design criteria include stability in the desired reaction conditions  biocatalyst activity and productivity yield  ease of product isolation  product purity and cost 
alternative approaches to biocatalytic process development typically involve designing and engineering the biocatalytic processes around shortcomings of available biocatalysts  including  for example  biocatalyst immobilization for stability and or reuse  special equipment and costly product isolation and purification methods 
we circumvent the need for these types of costly process design features by optimizing the biocatalyst for fitness in the desired process environment 
as a result  we enable and develop cost efficient processes that typically are relatively simple to run in conventional manufacturing equipment 
this also allows for the efficient technical transfer of our process to our manufacturing partners 
the successful embodiment of our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform in commercial manufacturing processes requires well integrated expertise in a number of technical disciplines 
in addition to those directly involved in practicing our directed evolution technologies  such as molecular biology  enzymology  microbiology  cellular engineering  metabolic engineering  bioinformatics  biochemistry  and high throughput analytical chemistry  our process development projects also involve integrated expertise in organic chemistry  chemical process development  chemical engineering  fermentation process development  and fermentation engineering 
our integrated  multi disciplinary approach to biocatalyst and process development is a critical success factor for our company 
enzyme optimization overview the enzyme optimization process starts by identifying genes that code for enzymes known to have the general type of catalytic reactivity for a desired chemical reaction 
typically  we identify gene sequences in published databases and then synthesize candidate genes having those sequences 
using a variety of biotechnology tools  we diversify these genes by introducing mutations  giving rise to changes in the enzymes for which they encode 
the methods for diversifying these genes  and types of diversity being tested  often vary over the course of an enzyme optimization program 
for finding initial diversity  methods typically include random mutagenesis and site directed included structure guided mutagenesis 
we also test mutational variations that distinguish related enzymes among different organisms 
once we have identified potentially beneficial mutations  we test combinations of these mutations in libraries made using our proprietary gene recombination methodologies  gene shuffling and multiplexed gene soeing  or splicing by overlap extension 
with our proprietary gene shuffling methodology  we generate libraries of genes that have random combinations of the mutations we are testing 
the pool of genes is used to transform host cells  which entails introducing the various genes  one by one  into host cells 
these cells are then segregated and grown into colonies 
cells from individual colonies are cultured in high throughput to produce the enzyme encoded by the shuffled gene in those cells 
the enzymes are then screened in high throughput using test conditions relevant to the desired process 
the screening results identify individual shuffled genes that 
table of contents produce improved enzymes having combinations of beneficial mutations and weed out enzymes having detrimental ones 
using different test conditions and or different analytical methods  we can identify variant enzymes that exhibit various improved performance characteristics  such as stability  activity and selectivity  under conditions relevant to the desired chemical process 
in the next step in our optimization process  we use our proprietary software tool  prosar  to analyze protein sequence activity relationships 
prosar aids in identifying specific gene and enzyme mutations that are beneficial  neutral or detrimental with respect to the desired performance characteristics 
earlier directed evolution methods did not separately evaluate individual mutations in libraries of variants which carry multiple mutations  where beneficial and detrimental performance characteristics may be mixed in an individual gene or enzyme 
capitalizing on the advent of inexpensive gene sequencing  we are able to determine which particular mutations are present in the genes and proteins we have screened 
our prosar bioinformatics software relates the screening results to the mutations and ranks the individual mutations with regard to their degree of benefit or detriment  relative to whichever process parameter s the screening tested 
using that information  we can bias the pool of mutational diversity in the next iteration to further the accumulation of beneficial diversity and cancel out detrimental diversity in the individual genes in the resulting shuffled library 
the prosar results also help us develop ideas about new diversity to test 
prosar  combined with efficient gene synthesis and high quality library generation methods  has led to a significant increase in the efficiency and speed of enzyme improvement and optimization 
in another step of our optimization process  we take the best variants we have identified and prepare enough of each to test in the desired chemical process at laboratory scale  for in process confirmation 
this optimization routine is done iteratively  typically adding new diversity to the pool in each iteration 
the gene that codes for the best performing enzyme in one iteration is used as the starting gene for the next iteration of shuffling and screening 
as the enzymes improve over these iterations  the screening conditions are made increasingly more stringent 
in this way  enzymes are rapidly optimized until all in process performance requirements have been achieved and the economic objectives for the desired process have been met 
multiplexed gene soeing is our proprietary methodology for rapidly generating gene variants 
using multiplexed gene soeing  we rapidly generate collections of individual gene variants that have predetermined  as opposed to random  combinations of mutations we are testing 
it is based on a biotechnology technique  which we refer to as soeing  generally used to make a hybrid  or spliced  gene from fragments of two genes and or to introduce a specific mutation into a splice between fragments of one gene 
we have automated the process to make robotically  in parallel  one hundred to several hundred variants  each with a predetermined combination of the mutations we are testing 
the variants are introduced into host cells  and the encoded enzyme is produced and screened in high throughput  as described above 
using multiplexed gene soeing  we can test many mutations and combinations thereof in parallel  and because the mutation incorporation is controlled and predetermined before screening  as opposed to random incorporation and selection after screening  the resulting data set can be more optimal for prosar analysis 
we believe using multiplexed gene soeing to survey many mutations quickly  followed by prosar driven shuffling of beneficial mutations  is a particularly effective approach  providing rapid gains in enzyme performance 
codex biocatalyst panels and kits codex biocatalyst panels were initially developed to speed our own internal process for identifying enzymes with desired characteristics for further optimization 
each codex biocatalyst panel is comprised of variants of one or more enzymes that catalyze one type of a generally useful chemical reaction 
we assemble  on one or more multi well sample plates  variants of a parent enzyme that we pre optimize for stability in industrial chemical processes and for ready manufacturability 
the variants are diversified to react to a variety of chemical structures that are susceptible to that type of chemical reaction 
either we or our innovator pharmaceutical customers use the codex biocatalyst panels to screen a new chemical structure against the assembled variants to identify variants that react with the new chemical structure rapidly 
for some new structures  a variant on the panel could enable production of the desired product 
we can also analyze the data from the panel screen using prosar to identify the mutations that are beneficial for the reaction of the new structure and further optimize the enzyme as needed using the enzyme optimization techniques described above 
in cases where a customer wishes to screen a proprietary new chemical structure itself  we can produce a custom panel of new variants on a sample plate produced by multiplexed gene soeing 
in  we launched codex screening kits as an alternative format to provide our enzymes to pharmaceutical development laboratories that are not equipped to use multi well sample plates 
the enzymes are instead individually provided in vials for the researchers to sample 
as of december   codex screening kits were in use or evaluation in manufacturing process development at over pharmaceutical companies worldwide 

table of contents microbe optimization using gene optimization for fermentation microbes  we enhance metabolic pathways by using gene optimization to improve the production and or productivity of one or more enzymes in a series of in vivo reactions that make a desired product 
we optimize the gene enzyme as described above using either in vitro or in vivo screening 
for fermentation applications  the microbes containing the improved gene s are directly evaluated in laboratory scale fermenters 
the metabolic pathway may naturally exist in the microbe  but productivity and or selectivity improvements are needed to produce more of the desired natural product and or less of an undesired by product economically 
we can also introduce a new metabolic pathway to produce a desired product using our gene shuffling technology in combination with synthetic biology  a type of metabolic engineering in which new genes are introduced into a microbe 
our gene enzyme optimization methodologies can be used to optimize fermentation microbes  including optimization of native and introduced non native cellulase genes for increased productivity in our cellulase production microbes  an introduced non native pathway in yeast for the conversion of xylose  a cellulose derived sugar  to ethanol  and an introduced non native pathway in a microbe for the production of codexol detergent alcohols 
microbe optimization using whole genome shuffling in addition to our gene optimization technology for enzymes  we have another complimentary technology in our platform for the optimization of fermentation microbes called whole genome shuffling 
whole genome shuffling allows us to improve the performance of a fermentation microbe by shuffling unidentified mutations in unidentified genes across the genome 
we start with a diversity of mutational variants of a fermentation organism  generated by conventional means such as random mutagenesis 
our whole genome shuffling involves introducing the entire genome of two or more such cells into a single cell  in which the genetic machinery of the combined cell recombines  or shuffles  the genomes 
in one method  this is accomplished by protoplast fusion  in which the cell walls are removed to leave the cells contents contained only by their cell membranes 
the cell membranes of these protoplasts in the diverse population are induced to fuse together into fusants containing the genome of two or more of the parent cells 
from these fusants  we regenerate normal cells  each with one copy of a hybridized genome 
microbial colonies are then grown and screened for their performance in the fermentative production of the desired product 
this process can be repeated  including with the introduction of new mutations  until the desired performance in the fermentation process is achieved 
one of our collaborators is operating a fermentation process for a generic pharmaceutical product using microbes we developed by whole genome shuffling 
we are using our whole genome shuffling technology in our codexyme cellulase enzyme program and our codexol detergent alcohols program to optimize fermentation microbes  including optimization of enzyme production hosts for increased production of cellulase enzymes  and our detergent alcohol producing strain for increased productivity 
metabolic engineering and synthetic biology in addition to our proprietary enzyme and microbe optimization technologies  we have built expert capabilities in a suite of new metabolic engineering technologies for the development and optimization of fermentation microbes 
these technologies are generally applicable to our pathway and strain engineering programs 
genomics  transcriptomics  proteomics and metabolomics all provide more in depth analyses of the metabolic functioning of fermentation microbes  and differences between variants  to guide further improvements 
in many cases  these analyses help to identify enzymes that need to be modified removed  increased  stabilized or otherwise modified in order to increase the overall productivity and performance of the strain 
synthetic biology involves the design  synthesis and introduction of new genetic programming to organisms for new biological functions 
this field has rapidly developed in recent years as dna synthesis and sequencing costs have rapidly dropped 
using synthetic biology  we are taking advantage of the publicly available gene and genome sequence information in our gene and metabolic pathway optimization projects 
this information is being leveraged by our prosar software and multiplexed gene soeing methodologies 

table of contents intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and technology under patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
we also rely heavily on confidential disclosure agreements for further protection of our proprietary products and technologies 
protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products that are not available from our competitors  and to exclude our competitors from practicing technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed from other parties 
for example  our ability to supply innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers depends on our ability to supply proprietary enzymes or methods for making pharmaceutical intermediates or apis that are not available from our competitors 
likewise  in the generic pharmaceutical area  proprietary protection  through patent  trade secret or other protection of our enzymes and methods of producing a pharmaceutical product is important for us and our customers to maintain a lower cost production advantage over competitors 
as of december   we owned or controlled approximately issued patents and approximately pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
these patents and patent applications are directed to our enabling technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceutical and bioindustrial markets 
the earliest that any of our intellectual property rights will expire is the issued patents covering our fundamental shuffling technologies have terms ending as late as our united states intellectual property rights directed to our second generation enabling technologies have terms that expire from to we continue to file new patent applications  for which terms generally extend years from the filing date in the united states 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with maxygen  inc  or maxygen  directed evolution technology  known as the molecularbreeding technology platform  including patents  trademarks  copyrights  software and certain assumed contracts 
prior to this transaction  we and maxygen were parties to a license agreement pursuant to which maxygen granted us a worldwide  exclusive license to certain maxygen intellectual property related to the use of directed evolution technology in a variety of fields of use 
since we now own substantially all of the intellectual property rights subject to the original license  the original license with maxygen has been terminated 
the intellectual property rights and assets that we acquired from maxygen will continue to be subject to existing license rights previously granted by maxygen to third parties  including perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  and to novozymes a s  or novozymes 
perseid retains exclusive licenses to use the intellectual property for the discovery  research and development of protein pharmaceuticals 
we and novozymes enjoy co exclusive rights in certain fields  including biofuels 
novozymes did not receive a license to all of the rights we are using in biofuels applications and which we believe are critical to pursuing such applications 
novozymes also has exclusive rights to certain of the intellectual property that we acquired from maxygen in certain limited fields  including development  production and sales of industrial proteins for use in processes for textile  garment  leather  wood and paper production  certain starch  food and animal feed production  certain personal care products  oil drilling  dyestuffs and dyeing and electronics industry waste water treatment 
as part of the transaction with maxygen  we entered into a new license agreement with maxygen  pursuant to which we granted to maxygen certain license rights to the intellectual property assets that we acquired to the extent necessary for maxygen to fulfill its contractual obligations under the license agreements retained by maxygen 
we will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain trade secrets in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property 
it is possible that our current patents  or patents which we may later acquire  may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part 
it is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect 
we sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances 
due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications  sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them 
it is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business 
in addition  any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage  in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity 
our registered and pending united states and foreign trademarks include codexis  codex  codeevolver  codexporter  codexol  codexyme  powered by codeevolver  driving the new sugar economy  we re codexis 
proven products 
real results  bringing life to chemistry  and a codexis and design mark ie  the codexis logo 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours 
patent  trademark  and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products 
the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to operate under aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
third parties may also design around our proprietary rights  which may render our protected technology and products less valuable  if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace 

table of contents in addition  if any of our products or technology is covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights  we could be subject to various legal actions 
we cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement  invalidity  misappropriation  or other claims 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
moreover  any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to make  use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim  or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology 
competition overview we are a leader in the field of directed molecular evolution of biocatalysts 
we are aware that other companies  including dsm  ei dupont de nemours and company  or dupont  and vercipia biofuels  an affiliate of bp plc  have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity 
academic institutions such as the california institute of technology  the max planck institute and the center for fundamental and applied molecular evolution fame  a jointly sponsored initiative between emory university and georgia institute of technology  are also working in this field 
this field is highly competitive and companies and academic and research institutions are actively seeking to develop technologies that could be competitive with our technologies 
we are aware that other companies  organizations and persons have developed technologies that appear to have some similarities to our patented proprietary technologies 
in addition  academic institutions are also working in this field 
technological developments by others may result in our products and technologies  as well as products developed by our customers using our biocatalysts  becoming obsolete 
we monitor publications and patents that relate to directed molecular evolution to be aware of developments in the field and evaluate appropriate courses of action in relation to these developments 
many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development  personnel and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop competing and or superior technologies and processes  and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could 
our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors 
as more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets  the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases  which could lead to litigation 
we also face differing forms of competition in our various markets  as set forth below pharmaceuticals our primary competitors in the pharmaceutical market are companies using conventional  non enzymatic processes to manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates and apis that compete in the marketplace with our enzymatically manufactured products 
the principal methods of competition and competitive differentiation in this market are product quality and performance  including manufacturing yield and safety and environmental benefits  speed of delivery of product and price 
the market for the manufacture and supply of apis and intermediates is large with many established companies 
these companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers  such as merck  pfizer  and teva  who have significant internal research and development efforts directed at developing processes to manufacture apis and intermediates 
the processes used by these companies include classical conventional organic chemistry reactions  chemo catalysis reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts  or biocatalytic routes using commercially available enzymes  or combinations thereof 
our manufacturing processes must compete with these internally developed routes 
additionally  there are many large well established fine chemical manufacturing companies that compete to supply pharmaceutical intermediate and apis to our customers  such as dsm  basf corporation and lonza group ltd 
finally  we face increasing competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in low cost centers such as india and china 
in addition to competition from companies manufacturing intermediates and apis  we face competition from companies that sell enzymes for use in the pharmaceutical market 
the market for supplying enzymes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing is quite fragmented 
there is competition from large industrial enzyme companies  such as novozymes and amano enzyme inc  whose industrial enzymes for detergents  for example are occasionally used in pharmaceutical processes 
there is also competition in this area from several small european companies with relatively limited product offerings comprised primarily 
table of contents of naturally occurring enzymes 
in addition to these enzyme supply companies  there is a separate group of small companies  also predominately in europe  that offers enzyme optimization services 
we believe that our principal advantage is our ability to rapidly deliver customized enzyme products for existing and new intermediates and apis in the pharmaceuticals market 
this capability has allowed us to create a breadth of products with improved performance characteristics including  for example  activity  stability  and activity on a range of substrates  compared to traditional chemistry based manufacturing processes and naturally occurring biocatalysts 
we believe that our directed evolution technology provides substantially superior results  in shorter time frames  than companies offering competing biocatalyst development services 
cellulases many established companies are developing cellulases that could potentially compete with codexyme cellulase enzymes  including novozymes  which has partnered with gruppo mossi ghisolfi  or m g  in italy to be the cellulase supplier to a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plant being built by m g  dupont  which is marketing a line of cellulases to convert cellulosic biomass into sugar  and dsm  which is developing cellulase enzymes and has formed a joint venture with poet  poet dsm  to construct a facility to produce cellulosic ethanol in emmetsburg  iowa 
although few companies are currently converting cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars on a commercial scale  many of our competitors have been active in this area for many years  have invested significant resources in this effort  and have extensive patent portfolios regarding the relevant biocatalysts and related processes 
in addition  several companies are focused on developing non biocatalytic  thermochemical processes to convert cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars 
for example  coskata  inc is developing a hybrid thermochemical biocatalytic process to produce ethanol from a variety of feedstocks 
our cellulases will need to be competitive with all of these alternative products on price and performance 
new companies continue to enter this marketplace 
many of these companies are actively developing and applying for intellectual property rights  including patent rights  in this space 
detergent alcohols we announced codexol detergent alcohols in we face competition in this market from sasol  shell  basf  kao corporation and liaoning huaxing  all of which have been active in the detergent alcohol marketplace for many years and have an established history with customers 
we also face competition from smaller companies that are developing biological routes to detergent alcohols  such as ls  inc operations we conduct substantial operations outside of the united states 
we have facilities in redwood city  california and budapest  hungary

table of contents the feasibility of commercializing biofuels and bio based chemicals derived from cellulose  fluctuations in the price of and demand for commodities that our enzymes and fermentation organisms can be employed to produce or for substitute commodities  the availability  cost and location of cellulosic biomass sources  changes to existing biofuel regulations and policies  our potential bio based chemical products might not be approved or accepted by our customers  our ability to independently develop  manufacture  market  sell and distribute commercial cellulase enzymes  risks associated with the international aspects of our business  our ability to integrate any businesses we may acquire with our business  our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner  our ability to obtain  protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to prevent the theft or misappropriation of our biocatalysts  the genes that code for our biocatalysts  know how or technologies  potential advantages that our competitors and potential competitors may have in securing funding or developing products  business interruptions  such as earthquakes and other natural disasters  public concerns about the ethical  legal and social ramifications of genetically engineered products and processes  our ability to comply with laws and regulations  our ability to properly handle and dispose of hazardous materials used in our business  our ability to obtain and maintain governmental awards  potential product liability claims  the existence of government subsidies or regulation with respect to carbon dioxide emissions  and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
due to the various factors mentioned above  and others  the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 
we have a history of net losses  such losses may increase due to the termination of our research and collaboration with shell  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  including losses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from research and development agreements with our collaborators  particularly shell  who accounted for   and of our revenues in   and  respectively 
our research and development collaboration with shell terminated effective as of august   and we do not expect to receive further collaboration revenue from shell 
if we are unable to enter into binding collaboration agreements with new partners for our advanced biofuels program  we will have to suspend continued development of our codexyme cellulase enzymes  our revenues will decline substantially and our net losses may increase 
in addition  some of our collaboration agreements provide for milestone payments and future royalty payments  which we will only receive if we and our collaborators develop and commercialize products 
we also may fund development of additional pharmaceutical and potential bioindustrial products  including codexol detergent alcohols 
there can be no assurance that any of these products will become commercially viable or that we will ever achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we fail to achieve profitability  or if the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate  we may not be able to continue our business 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

table of contents our codexyme cellulase enzymes and our codexol detergent alcohols programs are heavily dependent on our ability to secure third party funding  or to identify and effect other strategic options with respect to those programs 
our current business plans for codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohols are heavily dependent on third party funding 
we previously received significant funding for our advanced biofuels program from shell under a collaborative research agreement 
this agreement terminated effective as of august  we are in early stage discussions with multiple parties about potential collaborations  but we cannot assure you that any of our discussions will lead to collaborations or that any new collaboration will fully substitute for the termination of the shell collaboration 
raizen and shell currently hold rights to use our cellulase enzyme technology in brazil  which could complicate our efforts to secure funding from third parties for our codexyme cellulase program 
we currently do not expect to receive development funding from ra zen to support our codexyme cellulase enzyme program 
to date  we have self funded all development work for our codexol detergent alcohols program 
we are seeking collaboration partners to assist us with funding the development and commercialization of codexol detergent alcohols 
we are also exploring other strategic options with respect to both programs 
if we are unable to agree to terms with new collaborators that provide us with the financial assistance and infrastructure necessary for us to develop and commercialize our products and execute our strategy with respect to codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohols  or if we are unable to identify and effect attractive strategic options for those programs  we may need to fund this development ourselves  which will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  or we may need to suspend the programs which may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we may need substantial additional capital in the future in order to expand our business 
our future capital requirements may be substantial  particularly as we continue to develop our business  including investing in our codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohol business opportunities 
although we believe that  based on our current level of operations  our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next months  we may need additional capital if our current plans and assumptions change 
our need for additional capital will depend on many factors  including the financial success of our pharmaceutical business  identifying business partners to fund our cellulase program and our codexol detergent alcohol program  or identifying other strategic options with respect to such programs  our spending to develop and commercialize new and existing products  the effect of any acquisitions of other businesses  technologies or facilities that we may make or develop in the future  our spending on new market opportunities  including bio based chemicals  and the filing  prosecution  enforcement and defense of patent claims 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet our capital requirements  and we are unable to enter into or maintain collaborations with partners that are able or willing to fund our development efforts or commercialize any products that we develop or enable  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technology and products and complete the commercialization of products  if any  resulting from our technologies 
if future financings involve the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
if we raise debt financing  we may be subject to restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business 
we may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds and fail to generate sufficient revenues to achieve planned gross margins and to control operating costs  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research or development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business 
we have determined that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of december   which could  if not remediated  adversely impact the reliability of our financial reports  cause us to submit our financial reports in an untimely fashion  result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting  which in turn could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting 
at the end of each fiscal year  we must perform an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting  include in our annual report the results of the evaluation  and have our external auditors publicly attest to such evaluation 
in connection with the integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and management assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting at december   a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified 
the material weakness we identified relates to the lack of a sufficient number of qualified personnel to timely and appropriately account for complex  non routine transactions in accordance with 
table of contents united states generally accepted accounting principles 
examples of these significant non routine transactions include  but are not limited to  complicated revenue recognition transactions and complex contractual arrangements 
as a result of the restructuring activities following the termination of the shell collaboration in august  we experienced significant turnover in our finance and accounting management 
notwithstanding the use of contract personnel and external consultants  our inability to attract  train  manage and retain qualified finance and accounting personnel negatively impacted our ability to appropriately address complex  non routine transactions 
a material weakness is defined as a deficiency  or combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
as a result of the material weakness described above  we have concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december  based on the guidelines established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
we have not yet been able to remediate this material weakness 
we do not know the specific timeframe needed to remediate all of the control deficiencies underlying this material weakness 
in addition  we may need to incur incremental costs associated with this remediation  primarily due to the hiring of finance and accounting personnel  and the implementation and validation of improved accounting and financial reporting procedures 
if we are not successful in remediating the material weakness  or if we determine in future fiscal periods that we have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely impacted  we may be unable to submit our reports in a timely fashion and we could be required to restate our financial results 
this could cause current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
if goodwill or our intangible or other long lived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
our total assets reflect substantial goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and at any interim date whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we review our long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances ie  information that indicates an impairment might exist  could include a significant decrease in the market price of the company common stock  current period cash flow losses or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the assets  slower growth rates in our industry  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the assets  loss of significant customers or partners  or the current expectation that the assets will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of their estimated useful life 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets is determined  resulting in an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we implemented cost saving measures in the third and fourth quarters of and may implement additional cost saving measures in the future 
these measures may interfere with the operation of our business and if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of these measures  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we implemented a reduction in our global workforce and implemented other cost savings measures to reduce our cash expenditures 
these measures included the termination of approximately of our global workforce and the closing of our singapore facility 
we are also in the process of vacating one of our facilities in redwood city  california and attempting to sublease it 
if we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and financial benefits from this workforce reduction  or if we are unable to sublease the vacated facility  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
restructuring costs include expenses related to severance for terminated employees and other exit related costs arising from contractual and other obligations 
we continue to review our cost structure and may implement further cost saving initiatives in the future 
these cost reduction efforts may interfere with our ability to achieve our business objectives  may be difficult to manage  may cause concerns from current and potential customers  suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business and may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key employees  all of which may have an adverse impact on our business 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers 
our current revenues are derived from a limited number of key customers 
for the year ended december   our top five customers accounted for of our total revenues  with shell accounting for of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   our top five customers accounted for of our total revenues  with shell accounting for of our total 
table of contents revenues 
our research collaboration with shell terminated effective as of august   which means that we will not receive any additional collaboration funding from shell 
we expect a limited number of customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
the loss of business from shell will  and the loss or reduction from one or a combination of our other significant customers could  materially adversely affect our revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues  financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected if one or more of our customers is delayed in paying  or becomes unable to pay  for our delivered products on a timely basis 
certain of our customers are  or in the future may become  subject to significant economic and other challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside of the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms which may exceed contractual payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside of the united states  we may offer selected customers such payment flexibility 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable  and accordingly  we defer revenue until payment is received 
the costs associated with such revenue deferral are also deferred and classified as other current assets in the financial statements 
if these customers fail to pay us on a timely basis it may cause our financial results to fluctuate and we may decide to grant concessions to such customers to increase the probability of payment 
such concessions  or failure by such customers to pay at all  would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on a limited number of products in our pharmaceutical business 
our current product revenues are derived from a limited number of pharmaceutical products 
for the year ended december   we derived of our product revenue from two pharmaceutical product families statins and hepatitis c therapies 
we expect a limited number of pharmaceutical products to continue to account for a significant portion of our pharmaceutical product revenues for the foreseeable future 
this product concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
the loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of our significant pharmaceutical products could materially adversely affect our revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers for commercial scale production of substantially all of our enzymes 
we have limited internal capacity to manufacture enzymes 
as a result  we are dependent upon the performance and capacity of third party manufacturers for the commercial scale manufacturing of the enzymes used in our pharmaceutical and cellulase businesses 
we rely on one contract manufacturer  lactosan  for our pharmaceutical business to manufacture substantially all of the commercial enzymes used in our pharmaceutical business 
our pharmaceutical business  therefore  faces risks of difficulties with  and interruptions in  performance by lactosan  the occurrence of which could adversely impact the availability  launch and or sales of our enzymes in the future 
we have qualified other contract manufacturers to manufacture enzymes for our pharmaceutical business  but currently have limited reliance on them for our supply requirements 
the failure of any contract manufacturers that we may use to supply manufactured enzymes on a timely basis or at all  or to manufacture our enzymes in compliance with our specifications or applicable quality requirements or in volumes sufficient to meet demand would adversely affect our ability to sell pharmaceutical products  could harm our relationships with our collaborators or customers and could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
we may be forced to secure alternative sources of supply  which may be unavailable on commercially acceptable terms  cause delays in our ability to deliver products to our customers  increase our costs and decrease our profit margins 
we do not have any supply agreements in place with any enzyme contract manufacturers  other than lactosan 
in the absence of a supply agreement  a contract manufacturer will be under no obligation to manufacture our enzymes and could elect to discontinue their manufacture at any time 
if we require additional manufacturing capacity and are unable to obtain it in sufficient quantity  we may not be able to increase our pharmaceutical sales  or we may be required to make substantial capital investments to build that capacity or to contract with other manufacturers on terms that may be less favorable than the terms we currently have with our suppliers 
if we choose to build our own additional manufacturing facility  it could take two years or longer before our facility is able to produce commercial volumes of our enzymes 
any resources we expend on acquiring or building internal manufacturing capabilities could be at the expense of other potentially more profitable opportunities 
in addition  if we contract with other manufacturers  we may experience delays of several months in qualifying them  which could harm our relationships with our collaborators or customers and could negatively affect our revenues or operating results 

table of contents we also expect to use contract manufacturers to produce our cellulase enzymes and any products we may manufacture for the fine chemical markets 
these businesses will encounter similar risks in engaging contract manufacturers as our pharmaceutical business in the event we elect to use contract manufacturers 
if we are unable to develop and commercialize new products for the pharmaceutical market  our business and prospects will be harmed 
we plan to launch new products for the pharmaceutical market 
these efforts are subject to numerous risks  including the following pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to adopt new manufacturing processes that use our enzymes  we may be unable to successfully develop the enzymes or manufacturing processes for our products in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  we may face difficulties in transferring the developed technologies to our customers and the contract manufacturers that we may use for commercial scale production of intermediates and enzymes  the contract manufacturers that we may use may be unable to scale their manufacturing operations to meet the demand for these products and we may be unable to secure additional manufacturing capacity  customers may not be willing to purchase these products for the pharmaceutical market from us on favorable terms  if at all  we may face product liability litigation  unexpected safety or efficacy concerns and pharmaceutical product recalls or withdrawals  changes in laws or regulations relating to the pharmaceutical industry could cause us to incur increased costs of compliance or otherwise harm our business  our customers pharmaceutical products may experience adverse events or face competition from new products  which would reduce demand for our products  we may face pressure from existing or new competitive products  and we may face pricing pressures from existing or new competitors  some of which may benefit from government subsidies or other incentives 
we are dependent on our collaborators  and our failure to successfully manage these relationships could prevent us from developing and commercializing many of our products and achieving or sustaining profitability 
our ability to maintain and manage collaborations in our markets is fundamental to the success of our business 
we currently have license agreements  research and development agreements  supply agreements and or distribution agreements with various collaborators 
we may have limited or no control over the amount or timing of resources that any collaborator is able or willing to devote to our partnered products or collaborative efforts 
any of our collaborators may fail to perform its obligations 
these collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  our collaborators may not develop products arising out of our collaborative arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing  or sale of these products 
moreover  disagreements with a collaborator could develop and any conflict with a collaborator could reduce our ability to enter into future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationships with one or more existing collaborators 
if any of these events occur  or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our collaborators  we may not be able to commercialize our existing and potential products  grow our business  or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
our collaboration opportunities could be harmed if we do not achieve our research and development objectives under our collaboration agreements in a timely manner or at all  we develop products and processes or enter into additional collaborations that conflict with the business objectives of our other collaborators  we disagree with our collaborators as to rights to intellectual property that are developed during the collaboration  or their research programs or commercialization activities  
table of contents we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous collaborations  our collaborators become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors  our collaborators become unable or less willing to expend their resources on research and development or commercialization efforts due to general market conditions  their financial condition or other circumstances beyond our control  or our collaborators experience business difficulties  which could eliminate or impair their ability to effectively perform under our agreements 
additionally  despite the termination of the research term of our three way research collaboration with shell and iogen  many elements of our collaborative research and license agreement with shell and iogen will continue 
for example  the collaborative research and license agreement provides for certain rights  licenses and obligations of each party with respect to intellectual property and program materials that will continue after the research activities have ended 
disagreements or conflicts between and among the parties could develop even though the research program has ended 
these disagreements or conflicts could result in expensive arbitration or litigation  which may not be resolved in our favor 
finally  our business could be negatively affected if any of our collaborators or suppliers undergo a change of control or were to otherwise assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements 
our efforts to deploy our technology platform in adjacent market spaces  such as fine chemicals and therapeutic enzymes  may fail 
we are exploring whether to use our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform to develop new products in several new adjacent market spaces  including fine chemicals and therapeutic enzymes 
we do not know if we can successfully compete in these new market opportunities 
each of these new markets is well established and consists of numerous large  well funded entrenched market participants who have long and established track records and customer relationships 
if we develop new products to introduce into one or more of these new markets  we may not succeed in displacing current products 
if we succeed in commercializing these new products  we may not generate significant revenue and cashflows from these activities 
the failure to successfully deploy products in these new market spaces may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and business prospects 
if we lose key personnel  including key management personnel  or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel as needed in the future  it could disrupt the operation of our business  delay our product development programs  harm our research and development efforts  and we may be unable to pursue collaborations or develop our own products 
our business involves complex  global operations across a variety of markets and requires a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas in which we operate 
the loss of any key members of our management team or the failure to attract or retain other key employees who possess the requisite expertise for the conduct of our business could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into collaborations or licensing arrangements to execute on our business strategy 
in addition  the loss of any key scientific staff  or the failure to attract or retain other key scientific employees  could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into collaborations or licensing arrangements to execute on our business strategy 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology based businesses  particularly in the areas of biofuels and bio based chemicals  or due to the availability of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business 
additionally  potential future government awards may require us to maintain a minimum level of staffing 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our collaborators and customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs 
in particular  our product and process development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and engineers 
competition for experienced scientists and other technical personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms 
all of our employees are at will employees  which means that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time 
our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products and processes developed through our technology platform or acquired through strategic or other transactions  especially in the end markets that we seek to penetrate 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  and the development of additional 
table of contents expertise by existing personnel 
the inability to attract personnel with appropriate skills or to develop the necessary expertise could impair our ability to grow our business 
in august and september  we implemented a corporate restructuring plan that included a reduction in work force of approximately of our total workforce and the closure of one of our overseas offices 
the restructuring and reductions in workforce have had and may continue to have a negative effect on employee morale  and we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
our business could be adversely affected if our customers pharmaceutical products are not received well in the market  if their pharmaceutical products  or the processes used by our customers to manufacture their final pharmaceutical products  fail to be approved  or if our customers discontinue their drug development activities for any reason 
our enzymes are used in the manufacture of intermediates and apis which are then used in the manufacture of final pharmaceutical products by our existing and potential branded drug customers 
our business could be adversely affected if these final pharmaceutical products do not perform in the market as well as expected  or if our customers encounter competition from new entrants into the market with competing  and possibly superior  pharmaceutical products 
additionally  these pharmaceutical products must be approved by the fda in the united states and similar regulatory bodies in other markets prior to commercialization 
if our customers who sell branded drugs  which we refer to as innovators  fail to receive regulatory approval for the drugs  fail to receive regulatory approval for new manufacturing processes for previously approved drugs  or decide for business or other reasons to discontinue their drug development activities  our revenues and prospects will be negatively impacted 
the process of producing these drugs  and their generic equivalents  is also subject to regulation by the fda in the united states and equivalent regulatory bodies in other markets 
if any pharmaceutical process that uses our enzymes does not receive approval by the appropriate regulatory body or if customers decide not to pursue approval  our business could be adversely affected 
our pharmaceutical product gross margins are variable and may decline from quarter to quarter 
our pharmaceutical product gross margins have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors  including product mix  pricing pressure from our pharmaceutical customers and competition from other products or technologies 
this variability may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
our generic pharmaceutical business is partially dependent on arch ability to effectively market and sell certain pharmaceutical products 
under the new arch enzyme supply agreement  we sell enzymes to arch that it uses to manufacture apis and intermediates that it sells to pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
a portion of our pharmaceuticals product revenues are dependent on arch ability to market and sell apis and intermediates that are made by arch using our enzymes 
we cannot control arch level of activity or expenditures relating to the marketing of such pharmaceutical products relative to the rest of their products or marketing efforts 
arch may fail to effectively market these pharmaceutical products 
conflicting priorities  competing demands or other factors that we cannot control  and of which we may not be aware  may cause arch to deemphasize such pharmaceutical products 
if arch does not successfully promote these pharmaceutical products in the marketplace  this could have an adverse impact on our pharmaceutical business and our revenues and operating results 
if we are unable to maintain license rights to a commercial scale expression system for enzymes that convert cellulosic biomass to sugars  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we entered into a license agreement with dyadic international  inc and its affiliate  or dyadic  in november to obtain access to an expression system and the enzymes that convert cellulosic biomass to sugars 
under the license agreement with dyadic  we obtained a non exclusive license under intellectual property rights of dyadic relating to dyadic proprietary fungal expression technology for the production of enzymes and to the cellulase enzymes 
we also obtained access to specified materials of dyadic relating to such dyadic technology 
our license is sublicenseable to shell and to affiliates of shell in the field of biofuels 
dyadic has the right to terminate our licenses under the license agreement if we challenge the validity of any of the patents licensed under the license agreement and for various other reasons 
our licenses and access to such materials of dyadic under the license agreement will terminate as a result of any termination of the license agreement other than due to dyadic material breach 
if we are unable to maintain these rights on commercially reasonable terms or if the license agreement is terminated for any reason  we will need to buy or license this type of expression system from another party or develop this type of expression system ourselves  which may be difficult  costly and time consuming  in part because of the broad  existing intellectual property rights owned by novozymes and ei du pont de nemours and company  or dupont  and others 
if any of these events occur  our business may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents commercialization of biofuels and bio based chemicals derived from cellulose may not be feasible 
we are developing codexyme cellulase enzymes for use in producing advanced biofuels and bio based chemicals 
however  production and commercialization of cellulosic biofuels and bio based chemicals may not be feasible for a variety of reasons 
for example  the development of technology for converting sugar derived from cellulosic biomass into a commercially viable biofuel or bio based chemical is still unproven  and we do not know whether this can be done commercially and profitably 
we believe that there are very few commercial scale cellulosic biofuel and cellulosic bio based chemicals production plants in operation 
there can be no assurance that anyone will be able or willing to successfully develop and operate these production plants at commercial scale or that any of these facilities can be profitable 
additionally  if existing tax credits  subsidies and other incentives in the united states and foreign markets are phased out or reduced  the overall cost of commercialization of cellulosic biofuels will increase 
fluctuations in the price of and demand for certain commodities may reduce demand for the commercial products that use our technology  thus reducing demand for our technology 
biofuels and some bio based chemicals are anticipated to be marketed as an alternative to fossil fuel based products 
therefore  if the price of natural gas or oil falls  any revenues that we generate from biofuel or bio based chemical products could decline  and we may be unable to produce products that are a commercially viable alternative to fossil fuel based products 
for instance  implementation of and advances in hydraulic fracturing technology for the production of natural gas from shale has increased the availability of  and decreased the price of  natural gas in recent years 
additionally  demand for liquid transportation fuels  including biofuels  may decrease due to economic conditions or otherwise 
demand for bio based chemicals may also decrease if the price of natural gas or oil decreases 
similarly  codexyme cellulase enzymes are used in producing fermentable sugars  which are anticipated to be marketed as an alternative to fermentable sugars from sugar and starch food sources  such as corn and sugar cane 
therefore  if the price of sugar falls  the demand for codexyme cellulase enzymes  may fall  and we may be unable to produce cellulase enzymes for use in producing fermentable sugars that are a commercially viable alternative to fermentable sugars from sugar and starch food sources 
our biofuel and bio based chemical business opportunities may be limited by the availability  cost or location of feedstocks 
our business opportunities in the biofuel and bio based chemical markets may be dependent on the availability and price of feedstocks  including sugar  starch and cellulosic biomass 
if the availability of these feedstocks decreases or their price increases  this may reduce the desirability of our biofuel and bio based chemical products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
at certain levels  prices may make these products uneconomical to use and produce 
the price and availability of feedstocks may be influenced by general economic  market and regulatory factors 
these factors include the availability of arable land to supply feedstock  weather conditions  farming decisions  logistics for collection and storage of cellulosic biomass  government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade  and global demand and supply 
the significance and relative impact of these factors on the price of feedstocks is difficult to predict  especially without knowing what types of feedstocks we may need to use 
our current business plan for the biofuel and bio based chemical markets is to leverage our primary competitive strength  which we believe is our ability to optimize the performance of codexyme cellulase enzymes rapidly for varying feedstocks and process conditions 
while codexyme cellulase enzymes may perform well on specific feedstocks and under certain process conditions  it might not perform well on other feedstocks or process conditions 
if codexyme cellulase enzymes do not perform as planned on our customers feedstocks  our business may be adversely affected 
changes to existing biofuel regulations and policies may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers  all of which may significantly reduce demand for biofuels 
the market for biofuels is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies concerning the petroleum industry 
in  the united states congress passed an alternative fuels mandate that currently calls for approximately billion gallons of liquid transportation fuels sold in to come from alternative sources  including biofuels 
of this amount  a minimum of billion gallons must be advanced biofuels  with billion gallons of that to be cellulosic derived 
in the united states and a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency has the authority to adjust or reduce the gallon milestones of the alternative fuels mandate to reflect the marketplace supply availability 
any reduction in mandated requirements for fuel alternatives and additives to gasoline may cause demand for biofuels to decline and deter investment in the research and development of biofuels 
congressional and market uncertainty regarding future policies will affect our ability to develop new biofuels products or to license our technologies to third parties 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents biofuels business  financial condition and operating results 
our other potential bioindustrial products may be subject to additional regulations 
adoption of e ethanol blend in the united states may also be a significant factor in commercialization of cellulosic ethanol 
the united states environmental protection agency granted final approval for the sale of e on june  however  federal  state and local governments have yet to determine their role in providing infrastructure support to aid retailers in installing  or replacing  fuel pumps that are required for e installation of such pumps is an option  not a requirement  and if it is not adopted in the coming years it may limit the future demand for both corn based and cellulosic ethanol in the united states 
our potential bio based chemical products may not be approved or accepted by customers 
we have only recently entered the market for bio based chemical products used by large consumer products or chemical companies through our collaboration with chemtex  a subsidiary of gruppo mossi ghisolfi 
in entering this market  we intend to sell codexol detergent alcohols as an alternative to chemicals currently in use  and in some cases the chemicals that we seek to replace have been used for many years 
the potential customers for our bio based chemical products generally have well developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of the chemical components of their products and may resist changing these processes and components 
these potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers 
factors that these potential customers consider during the product qualification process include consumer preference  manufacturing considerations such as process changes and capital and other costs associated with transitioning to alternative components  supplier operating history  regulatory issues  product liability and other factors  many of which are unknown to  or not well understood by  us 
satisfying these processes may take many months or years 
if we are unable to convince these potential customers that our products are comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that the use of our products produces benefits to them  we will not be successful in these markets and our business will be adversely affected 
additionally  in contrast to the tax incentives relating to biofuels  tax credits and subsidies are not currently available in the united states for consumer products or chemical companies who use our bio based chemical products 
we face risks associated with our international business 
significant portions of our operations are conducted outside of the united states and we expect to continue to have significant foreign operations in the foreseeable future 
international business operations are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products  repatriate profits to the united states or operate our foreign located facilities  the imposition of tariffs  the imposition of limitations on  or increase of  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures  the imposition of limitations on genetically engineered products or processes and the production or sale of those products or processes in foreign countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  uncertainties relating to foreign laws  regulations and legal proceedings including tax  import export  anti corruption and exchange control laws  the availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us  increased demands on our limited resources created by our diversified  global operations may require us to expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract  train  manage and retain qualified management  technicians  scientists and other personnel which we may be unable to do effectively  economic or political instability in foreign countries  difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  and the need to comply with a variety of united states and foreign laws applicable to the conduct of international business  including import and export control laws and anti corruption laws 

table of contents in  we began doing business in brazil and we will likely need to secure licenses  permits or other governmental approvals in order to use our technology there 
the failure to obtain any applicable licenses  permits or other governmental approvals could delay or prevent the deployment of our technology in brazil 
if we engage in any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations 
we have made acquisitions in the past  and if appropriate opportunities become available  we expect to acquire additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products to enhance our business in the future 
for example  in october  we acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with maxygen directed evolution technology 
in connection with any future acquisitions  we could issue additional equity securities  which would dilute our current stockholders  incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions  use our cash to fund the acquisitions  or assume significant liabilities including litigation risk 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs and other liabilities  diversion of management attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and or prospective collaborators  customers and or suppliers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
we do not have extensive experience in managing the integration process and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  assets  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating  financial and management resources  if at all 
the integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business  result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business 
acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls  which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting 
if we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we must rely on our suppliers  contract manufacturers and customers to deliver timely and accurate information in order to accurately report our financial results in the time frame and manner required by law 
we need to receive timely  accurate and complete information from a number of third parties in order to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis 
we rely on suppliers and certain contract manufacturers to provide us with timely and accurate information regarding our inventories and manufacturing cost information  and we rely on current and former collaborators to provide us with product sales and cost saving information in connection with royalties owed to us 
any failure to receive timely information from one or more of these third parties could require that we estimate a greater portion of our revenues and other operating performance metrics for the period  which could cause our reported financial results to be incorrect 
moreover  if the information that we receive is not accurate  our financial statements may be materially incorrect and may require restatement  and we may not receive the full amount of revenues that we are entitled to under these arrangements 
although we typically have audit rights with these parties  performing such an audit could be harmful to our collaborative relationships  expensive and time consuming and may not be sufficient to reveal any discrepancies in a timeframe consistent with our reporting requirements 
our ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies or if we lose some of our intellectual property rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property for our technologies and products and potential products in the united states and other countries 
we have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the united states and in foreign countries with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes 
as such  as of december   we owned or controlled approximately issued patents and approximately pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
some of our gene shuffling patents will expire as early as we also have license rights to a number of issued patents and pending 
table of contents patent applications in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to our enabling technologies and to the methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceuticals manufacturing  biofuels and bio based chemicals markets 
we intend to continue to apply for patents relating to our technologies  methods and products as we deem appropriate 
numerous patents in our portfolio involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty 
issued patents and patents issuing from pending applications may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
moreover  the united states leahy smith america invents act  enacted in september  brings significant changes to the united states patent system  which include a change to a first to file system from a first to invent system and changes to the procedures for challenging issued patents and disputing patent applications during the examination process  among other things 
the effects of these changes on our patent portfolio and business have yet to be determined  as the final substantive provisions of the america invents act took effect on march   the united states patent and trademark office only recently finalized the rules relating to these changes and the courts have yet to address the new provisions 
these changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights 
additional uncertainty may result from legal precedent handed down by the united states federal circuit court and supreme court as they determine legal issues concerning the scope and construction of patent claims and inconsistent interpretation of patent laws by the lower courts 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  or even if issued  predict the breadth of the claims upheld in our and other companies patents 
given that the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  we cannot ensure that i we were the first to invent the inventions covered by each of our pending applications  ii we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  or iii the proprietary technologies we develop will be patentable 
in addition  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
moreover  third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection 
such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the united states or other territories 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
moreover  others may independently develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies 
if that happens  we may need to license these technologies  and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  if at all  which could cause harm to our business 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights  which may subject us to costly and time consuming litigation and prevent us from developing or commercializing our products 
our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties  and without breaching any licenses or other agreements that we have entered into with regard to our technologies  products and business 
we cannot ensure that patents have not been issued to third parties that could block our ability to obtain patents or to operate as we would like 
there may be patents in some countries that  if valid  may block our ability to make  use or sell our products in those countries  or import our products into those countries  if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring the rights to these patents 
there also may be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that  if granted and valid  may also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in these countries if we are unable to circumvent or license them 
the industries in which we operate  and the biotechnology industry in particular  are characterized by frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
many biotechnology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
our involvement in litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings inside and outside of the united states  to defend our intellectual property rights or as a result of alleged infringement of the rights of others  may divert our management time from focusing on business operations and could cause us to spend significant amounts of money 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling or using our products or technologies that use the subject intellectual property  pay monetary damages or substantial royalties  grant cross licenses to third parties relating to our patents or proprietary rights  obtain from the third party asserting its intellectual property rights a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or 
table of contents redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing technology  or relocate the operations relating to the allegedly infringing technology to another jurisdiction  which may result in significant cost or delay to us  could be technically infeasible or could prevent us from selling some of our products in the united states or other jurisdictions 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by  and issued to  third parties 
we cannot assure you that if this third party intellectual property is asserted against us that we would ultimately prevail 
if any of our competitors have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention and  thus  the right to the patents for these inventions in the united states 
these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable 
even if successful  any interference may result in loss of certain claims 
any litigation or proceedings could divert our management time and efforts 
even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses  diversion of management time  and disruption in our business 
uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any patent or related litigation could harm our ability to compete 
we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
the laws of some foreign countries  including brazil  where we have recently begun to do business  do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or bioindustrial technologies 
accordingly  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights 
additionally  proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
if our biocatalysts  or the genes that code for our biocatalysts  are stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  others could use these biocatalysts or genes to produce competing products 
third parties  including our contract manufacturers  customers and those involved in shipping our biocatalysts  often have custody or control of our biocatalysts 
if our biocatalysts  or the genes that code for our biocatalysts  were stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce these biocatalysts for their own commercial gain 
if this were to occur  it would be difficult for us to challenge this type of use  especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection or in countries in which we do not have patents covering the misappropriated biocatalysts 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information 
we rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  but these measures may not be effective 
we require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property 
nevertheless  our proprietary information may be disclosed  third parties could reverse engineer our biocatalysts and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
competitors and potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or may use their greater resources to gain market share at our expense 
the biocatalysis industry and each of our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
in addition  as we enter new markets  we will face new competition and will need to adapt to competitive factors that may be different from what we face today 

table of contents we are aware that other companies  including royal dsm nv  or dsm  dupont  novozymes  and vercipia biofuels  an affiliate of bp plc  have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity 
academic institutions such as the california institute of technology  the max planck institute and the center for fundamental and applied molecular evolution fame  a jointly sponsored initiative between emory university and georgia institute of technology  are also working in this field 
technological development by others may result in our products and technologies  as well as products developed by our customers using our biocatalysts  becoming obsolete 
we face intense competition in the pharmaceuticals market 
there are a number of companies who compete with us throughout the various stages of a pharmaceutical product lifecycle 
many large pharmaceutical companies have internal capabilities to develop and manufacture intermediates and apis 
these companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers  such as merck  pfizer and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
there are also many large  well established fine chemical manufacturing companies  such as dsm  basf corporation and lonza group ltd  that compete to supply pharmaceutical intermediates and apis to our customers 
we also face increasing competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and contract manufacturers in low cost centers such as india and china 
in addition to competition from companies manufacturing apis and intermediates  we face competition from companies that sell biocatalysts for use in the pharmaceutical market 
there is competition from large industrial enzyme companies  such as novozymes and amano enzyme inc  whose industrial enzymes for detergents  for example are occasionally used in pharmaceutical processes 
there is also competition in this area from several small companies with product offerings comprised primarily of naturally occurring biocatalysts or that offer biocatalyst optimization services 
we expect to enter the market for cellulase enzymes  which are used to produce sugar for the manufacture of biofuels and bio based chemicals 
our significant competitors in this market include novozymes and dupont  which have both been active in this market for many years 
novozymes has partnered with a number of companies and organizations on a regional basis to develop cellulases for the production of biofuels  including partnering with m g in italy to be the cellulase supplier to a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plant being built by chemtex  and dupont is marketing a line of cellulases to convert cellulosic biomass into sugar 
these competitors have greater resources than we do  own or otherwise control established intellectual rights portfolios  have existing relationships with customers that we hope to sell codexyme cellulase enzymes to  have long term supply agreements already in place with customers for their bio based products  and have the supply chain in place to sell their cellulases on a global platform 
our ability to compete in this market may be limited by our relatively late start 
additionally  dsm has announced that it expects to participate in this market 
there are also other companies developing competing cellulosic ethanol technologies 
significant competitors include companies such as novozymes  which is opening a biofuel demonstration plant with inbicon a s of denmark  dupont is marketing a line of cellulases to convert cellulosic biomass into sugar  dsm  which acquired c yeast company bv in enhancing dsm position in the cellulosic biofuel sector  and which has recently partnered with poet llc to form poet dsm advanced biofuels to construct a facility to produce cellulosic ethanol  mascoma corporation  which entered into a definitive agreement with valero energy corporation in december to build a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol biorefinery  bp  which is developing a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol facility through its affiliate vercipia biofuels  and coskata  inc  which is developing a hybrid thermochemical biocatalytic process to produce ethanol from a variety of feedstocks 
we entered the bio based chemical market in with our codexol detergent alcohols 
our significant competitors in this market include companies that have been active in this marketplace for many years  namely sasol  shell  basf  kao corporation and liaoning huaxing 
these companies have greater resources in this market than we do and have long term supply arrangements already in place with consumer products companies 
we also face competition from smaller companies that are developing biological routes to detergent alcohols  such as ls  inc our ability to compete in this market may be limited by our relatively late start 
our ability to compete successfully in any of these markets will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner and are technologically superior to and or are less expensive than other products on the market 
many of our competitors have substantially greater production  financial  research and development  personnel and marketing resources than we do 
they also started developing products earlier than we did  which may allow them to establish blocking intellectual property positions or bring products to market before we can 
in addition  certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop competing and or superior technologies and processes  and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could 
our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors 
we cannot be certain that any products we develop in the future will compare favorably to products offered by our competitors or that our existing or future products will compare favorably to any new products that are developed by our competitors 
as more 
table of contents companies develop new intellectual property in our markets  the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases  which could lead to litigation 
in addition  various governments have recently announced a number of spending programs focused on the development of clean technology  including alternatives to petroleum based fuels 
such spending programs could lead to increased funding for our competitors or the rapid increase in the number of competitors within those markets 
our limited resources relative to many of our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures 
this failure could reduce our competitiveness and market share  adversely affect our results of operations and financial position  and prevent us from obtaining or maintaining profitability 
business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales 
our headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations  such as riot  civil disturbances  war  terrorist acts  flood  infections in our laboratory or production facilities or those of our contract manufacturers and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur 
any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and success as an overall business 
ethical  legal and social concerns about genetically engineered products and processes could limit or prevent the use of our products  processes  and technologies and limit our revenues 
some of our products and processes are genetically engineered or involve the use of genetically engineered products or genetic engineering technologies 
if we and or our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical  legal  and social concerns relating to genetic engineering  our products and processes may not be accepted 
any of the risks discussed below could result in increased expenses  delays  or other impediments to our programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies or inventions 
our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our technologies  products  or processes could be limited by the following factors public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of  and ethical concerns over  genetic research and genetically engineered products and processes  which could influence public acceptance of our technologies  products and processes  public attitudes regarding  and potential changes to laws governing ownership of genetic material  which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage collaborators from supporting  developing  or commercializing our products  processes and technologies  and governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning genetically modified organisms  which could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative products 
the subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative publicity  which has aroused public debate 
this adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered products 
the biocatalysts that we develop have significantly enhanced characteristics compared to those found in naturally occurring enzymes or microbes 
while we produce our biocatalysts only for use in a controlled industrial environment  the release of such biocatalysts into uncontrolled environments could have unintended consequences 
any adverse effect resulting from such a release could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  and we may have exposure to liability for any resulting harm 
compliance with stringent laws and regulations may be time consuming and costly  which could adversely affect the commercialization of our bioindustrial products 
our bioindustrial products  including those used in the biofuels and bio based chemicals markets  will need to meet a significant number of regulations and standards  including regulations imposed by the united states department of transportation  the united states environmental protection agency  various state agencies and others 
in addition  our bioindustrial products will be subject to foreign regulations if we attempt to produce or sell our products outside the united states 
for example  we expect that our products and technologies will be subject to import and export controls when they are shipped internationally 
any failure to comply or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry regulations and standards could prevent or delay the commercialization of any bioindustrial products developed using our technologies and subject us to fines and other penalties 

table of contents we use hazardous materials in our business and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials or noncompliance of applicable laws and regulations could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our research and development and commercial processes involve the use of hazardous materials  including chemical  radioactive  and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste 
we cannot eliminate entirely the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of  and human exposure to  these materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
although we believe that our activities comply in all material respects with environmental laws  there can be no assurance that violations of environmental  health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error  accident  equipment failure or other causes 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and the failure to comply with past  present  or future laws could result in the imposition of fines  third party property damage  product liability and personal injury claims  investigation and remediation costs  the suspension of production  or a cessation of operations  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
environmental laws could become more stringent over time imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations  which could impair our research  development or production efforts and harm our business 
in addition  we may have to indemnify some of our customers or suppliers for losses related to our failure to comply with environmental laws  which could expose us to significant liabilities 
we face compliance risks associated with our government awards 
we are subject to routine audits by government agencies or other third parties as part of our government awards 
the government auditor may review our performance  cost structures and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
funds available under government financial assistance must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the funding agencies  rather than for all of our programs generally 
if any of our costs are found to be allocated improperly  the costs may not be reimbursed and any costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded 
accordingly  an audit could result in an adjustment to our revenues and results of operations 
we may be sued for product liability 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
for example  we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to drugs that are produced using our enzymes or that incorporate our intermediates and apis 
the biocatalysts  pharmaceutical intermediates and apis that we produce or are produced for us by our manufacturing partners could be subject to quality control or contamination issues of which we are not aware 
claims could be brought by various parties  including customers who are purchasing products directly from us  other companies who purchase products from our customers or by the end users of the drugs 
we could also be named as co parties in product liability suits that are brought against our contract manufacturers who manufacture our enzymes  pharmaceutical intermediates and apis  such as lactosan and or arch 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
we cannot assure you that any contract manufacturer that we have used in the past or shall use in the future has or will have adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims 
in addition  although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against us  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses  and if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
moreover  we have agreed to indemnify some of our customers for certain claims that may arise out of the use of our products  which could expose us to significant liabilities 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to offset future taxable income 
if the internal revenue service challenges our analysis that our existing nols are not subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes  our ability to utilize nols could be limited by section of the internal revenue code 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
furthermore  our ability to utilize nols of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations 
for these reasons  we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the nols reflected in our financial statements  even if we attain profitability 

table of contents risks related to owning our common stock we are subject to anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under delaware law  as well as our stockholder rights plan  that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us 
among other things  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a board of directors which is divided into three classes  with staggered three year terms and provide that all stockholder action must be effected at a duly called meeting of the stockholders and not by a consent in writing  and further provide that only our board of directors  the chairman of the board of directors  our chief executive officer or president may call a special meeting of the stockholders 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
these provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits  with some exceptions  stockholders owning in excess of of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
finally  our charter documents establish advanced notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if an offer to acquire our company may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
on september   we entered into a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each share of our common stock held by stockholders of record as of september  each right entitles stockholders  after the rights become exercisable  to purchase one one thousandth of a share of our series a preferred stock  par value  at a purchase price of per one thousandth of a share of series a preferred stock 
in general  the rights become exercisable at the close of business on the tenth business day following i public announcement that a person or group acquired or more of our common stock or ii commencement or announcement of a tender offer for or more of our common stock 
the rights may discourage a third party from making an unsolicited proposal to acquire us  as exercise of the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors since the rights may be redeemed by us at per right at any time before any person or group acquires or more of our outstanding common stock 
these rights expire in september concentration of ownership among our existing officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and depress our stock price 
based on the number of shares outstanding as of december   our officers  directors and stockholders who hold at least of our stock together beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
if these officers  directors  and principal stockholders or a group of our principal stockholders act together  they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders 
for instance  officers  directors  and principal stockholders  acting together  could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider 
similarly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company otherwise favored by our other stockholders 
as of december   ra zen  biomedical sciences investment fund pte ltd 
and cmea ventures beneficially owned approximately  and of our common stock  respectively 
our share price may be volatile which may cause the value of our common stock to decline and subject us to securities class action litigation

furthermore  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  or publish negative reports about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not have any control over these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock in a negative manner  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

table of contents we incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  as well as related rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market  impose various requirements on public companies that require our management and other personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our compliance with section requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance related issues

business overview we engineer enzymes for pharmaceutical  biofuel and chemical production 
our proven technologies enable scale up and implementation of biocatalytic solutions to meet customer needs for rapid  cost effective and sustainable process development  from research to manufacturing 
we have commercialized our technology and products in the pharmaceuticals market  which is our primary business focus 
there are currently over pharmaceutical firms using our technology  products and services in their manufacturing process development  including in the production of some of the world bestselling and fastest growing drugs 
we are developing our codexyme cellulase enzymes to convert non food plant material  which we call cellulosic biomass  into affordable sugars  which can then be converted into renewable fuels and chemicals 
we are also developing our own manufacturing process for codexol detergent alcohols  which are bio based chemicals 
detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  which are key  active cleaning ingredients in consumer products such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
we are seeking collaboration partners to assist us with the development and commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohols  and we are also exploring other strategic options with respect to these products and technologies 
we create our products by applying our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform  which introduces genetic mutations into microorganisms  giving rise to changes in the enzymes that they produce 
once we identify potentially beneficial mutations  we test combinations of these mutations until we have created variant enzymes that exhibit marketable performance characteristics superior to competitive products 
this process allows us to make continuous  efficient improvements to the performance of our enzymes 
results of operations overview to date  we have generated revenues primarily from collaborative research and development funding  pharmaceutical product sales and government awards 
our revenues in were million which is down significantly compared to our 
table of contents revenues of million and our revenues of million 
the decrease in revenues is primarily due to decreases in both our collaborative research and development revenue and pharmaceutical product sales 
most of our revenues since inception have been derived from collaborative research and development arrangements  which accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
our collaborative research agreement with shell terminated effective august  and as a result  we no longer receive collaborative research and development revenues from shell subsequent to august  this will significantly decrease our revenues as compared to prior periods and in all future periods 
collaborative research and development revenues received from shell were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
our product sales accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
our product sales in were million which is down significantly compared to our product sales of million and only a marginal increase compared to our product revenues of million 
the decrease in product sales as compared to is primarily due to the timing of generic and innovator pharmaceutical product orders and due to the new arch enzyme supply agreement  which became effective on november   as described below 
we have experienced significant losses as we have invested heavily in research and development and administrative infrastructure in connection with the growth in our business 
we intend to continue our investment in research and development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
termination of shell collaboration in september  we entered into the new shell agreement  which terminated our collaboration with shell under the existing shell research agreement and amended the existing shell license agreement 
see collaborations and license agreements shell in part i  item of this annual report on form k for a description of the new shell agreement 
the new shell agreement required shell to pay us million as full  complete and final satisfaction of amounts that shell may have owed to us under the shell research agreement with respect to i full time employee equivalents  or ftes  assigned by us to perform our obligations under the shell research agreement and ii milestones achieved or achievable by us under the shell research agreement 
we recognized this million payment as collaborative research and development revenues during the year ended december  beginning september   we have no further obligations to shell under the shell research agreement to provide any ftes to perform work under or after the collaboration and shell correspondingly has no future obligations to us under the shell research agreement to provide funding for ftes to perform work under or after the collaboration 
prior to the new shell agreement  shell had an obligation under the research agreement to fund us at specified rates for each fte  which as of were equal to  on an annual basis for each fte in the united states and  on an annual basis for each fte in hungary 
as of august   the number of ftes assigned by us to perform our obligations under the research agreement was for the year ended december   shell accounted for of our total revenues 
as a result of the termination of the shell research agreement  we initiated a series of cost reduction measures and refocused our business on the pharmaceuticals market 
we terminated approximately employees worldwide  consisting of research and development staff and general and administrative staff 
we also closed our singapore research and development facility 
we estimate that we will incur million in restructuring expenses related to these cost reduction measures  including severance for terminated employees  and other exit related costs arising from contractual obligations associated with closed facilities under lease and equipment disposals 
during  we recorded million of leasehold improvement write down  million of employee severance and other termination benefits  million of facility lease termination costs and million of equipment disposal charges 
we paid million in cash during the fourth quarter of for these restructuring expenses and expect to pay a remaining million in the first half of we anticipate our expected cost reductions resulting from restructuring our operation in the united states will be million 
our total expected cost reductions resulting from closing our operations in singapore is expected to be million 
we anticipate that these cost reduction measures will generate annual cost savings related to employee compensation costs of million  specifically million in general and administrative costs and million in research and development costs 
the remaining cost reduction measure will generate annual cost savings primarily related to outside services  information technology and laboratory equipment expenses  facilities expenses  and recruiting and relocation costs 

table of contents despite the termination of the shell research agreement  we expect to continue our advanced biofuels program  primarily focusing on developing our codexyme cellulase enzymes for use in producing advanced biofuels 
we are actively seeking third party funding to support our codexyme cellulase enzyme program 
we are in early stage discussions with multiple parties about potential collaborations  but there can be no assurances that any of our discussions will lead to collaborations or that any new collaboration will fully substitute for the termination of the shell collaboration 
we are exploring other strategic options for the program 
we currently do not expect to receive development funding from ra zen  our largest shareholder  to support our codexyme cellulase enzyme program 
if we are unable to agree to terms with new collaborators that provide us with the financial assistance and infrastructure necessary for us to develop and commercialize our products and execute our strategy with respect to codexyme cellulase enzymes  or if we are unable to identify and effect attractive strategic options for that program  we will need to continue to fund this development ourselves  which will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition  or we may need to suspend the program  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
maxygen transaction in october  we acquired maxygen s directed evolution technology patent portfolio for net consideration of million consisting of million paid to maxygen  related transaction costs of million and a royalty payable extinguishment of million 
in conjunction with this transaction  we terminated our existing license agreement with maxygen including terminating our obligation to pay biofuels royalties to maxygen 
co solutions investment our investment in co solutions and the joint development agreement we signed with co solutions in was our initial entry into carbon management 
we estimated the fair value of our investment in  common shares of co solutions using the market value of common shares as determined by trading on the tsx venture exchange 
during  we evaluated our investment in the common shares of co solutions and determined the impairment was other than temporary considering the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of co solutions  and our management s ability and intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers 
as a result of our analysis  we recorded an impairment of million during the year ended december  as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations as selling  general and administrative expense 
as of december   the fair value of our investment in co solutions common stock was million with an unrealized gain of  carbon management program our carbon management program received million in and million in in funding under a arpa e recovery act program award from the united states department of energy for development of innovative technology to remove carbon dioxide from coal fired power plant emissions 
the award supported development of biocatalysts for more efficient carbon capture from these plants 
the award agreement concluded in june we also had a collaboration in carbon management with alstom power  inc  or alstom  which included funding for up to ftes 
we recognized million in revenue in from this collaboration 
the alstom collaboration concluded in october we are no longer actively developing our carbon capture technology 
singapore economic development board grant we also received award revenues of million in and million in from the singapore economic development board  or edb  for our research and development center in singapore 
this award was terminated in december in conjunction with the closure of our singapore research facility 
arch collaboration since  arch of mumbai  india has manufactured substantially all of our commercialized intermediates and apis for sale to generic and innovator manufacturers 
we were party to a number of agreements with arch that govern the commercialization of various current and future products for supply into the generic and innovator marketplaces 
in november  we entered into the new arch enzyme supply agreement  which terminated our existing supply agreements with arch 
under the new arch enzyme supply agreement  arch agreed to exclusively purchase our proprietary enzymes from us for use in the manufacture of certain of arch s products and we agreed to exclusively supply  with limited exceptions  certain of our proprietary enzymes to arch at an agreed upon price for use in such manufacture 
arch will no longer produce api and intermediates for us to market and sell and arch will no longer pay us royalties on the sale of apis and intermediates to customers 
we expect that selling our proprietary enzymes to arch rather than selling the resulting apis or intermediates that arch manufactured for us will result in a decrease in our product revenues in all future periods 
however  we expect that our product gross margin will be higher  which we expect to result in a product gross profit comparable with our historical product gross profit 

table of contents contract manufacturers we have limited internal manufacturing capacity at our headquarters in redwood city  california 
we expect to rely on third party manufacturers for commercial production of our biocatalysts for the foreseeable future 
our in house manufacturing is dedicated to producing both our codex biocatalyst panels and kits and biocatalysts for use by our customers in pilot scale production 
we also supply initial commercial quantities of biocatalysts for use by our collaborators to produce pharmaceutical intermediates and manufacture biocatalysts that we sell 
we actively seek contract manufacturers who are willing to invest in capital equipment to manufacture our products at commercial scale 
as a result  we are heavily dependent on the availability of manufacturing capacity at  and the reliability of  our contract manufacturers 
we also pursue collaborations with industry leaders that allow us to leverage our collaborators engineering  manufacturing and commercial expertise  their distribution infrastructure and their ability to fund commercial scale production facilities 
if our collaborators choose to utilize our technology to commercialize new products  we expect our collaborators will finance  build and operate the larger  more expensive facilities for the intermediate or end products in our markets  which will allow us to expand into new markets without having to finance or operate large industrial facilities 
we primarily rely on one contract manufacturer lactosan  located in austria  to manufacture substantially all of the enzymes used in our pharmaceutical business 
we have qualified other contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our enzymes  but we do not currently use them for any of our supply commitments 
in addition  we contract with other suppliers for the manufacture of our pharmaceutical intermediates and apis 
other collaborations our strategy for collaborative arrangements is to retain substantial participation in the future economic value of our technology while receiving current cash payments to offset research and development costs and working capital needs 
these agreements are complex and have multiple elements that cover a variety of present and future activities 
in addition  certain elements of these agreements are intrinsically difficult to separate and treat as separate units for accounting purposes  especially exclusivity payments 
consequently  we expect to recognize these exclusivity payments over the term of the exclusivity period 
revenues and operating expenses revenues our revenues are comprised of collaborative research and development revenues  product revenues and government awards 
collaborative research and development revenues include license  technology access and exclusivity fees  fte payments  milestones  royalties  and optimization and screening fees 
product revenues consist of sales of biocatalysts  intermediates  apis and codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
government awards consist of payments from government entities 
the terms of these awards generally provide us with cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
historically  we have received government awards from germany  singapore and the united states 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes both internal and third party fixed and variable costs including amortization of purchased technology  materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs associated with our product revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for internal projects as well as partner funded collaborative research and development activities 
these costs include our direct and research related overhead expenses  which include salaries and other personnel related expenses including stock based compensation  occupancy related costs  supplies  depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment and amortization of acquired technologies  as well as research consultants  and are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
our research and development efforts devoted to our product and process development projects changed from projects in to projects in and in as we have focused our research and development resources on fewer projects 
our internal research and development projects are typically completed in to months  and generally the costs associated with any single internal project during these periods were not material 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses including stock based compensation  hiring and training costs  consulting and service provider expenses including patent counsel related costs  marketing costs  occupancy related costs  depreciation and amortization expenses  and travel and relocation expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the four basic revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  products have been delivered  transfer of technology has been completed or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our primary sources of revenues consist of collaborative research and development agreements  product revenues and government awards 
collaborative research and development agreements typically provide us with multiple revenue streams  including up front fees for licensing  exclusivity and technology access  fees for full time employee equivalent fte services and the potential to earn milestone payments upon achievement of contractual criteria and royalty fees based on future product sales or cost savings by our customers 
our collaborative research and development revenues consist of revenues from shell  which revenues have ceased as a result of the termination of the shell research agreement  and revenues from other collaborative research and development agreements 
for each source of collaborative research and development revenues  product revenues and award revenues  we apply the following revenue recognition criteria up front fees received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements  including license fees  technology access fees  and exclusivity fees  are deferred upon receipt  are not considered a separate unit of accounting and are recognized as revenues over the relevant performance periods 
revenues related to fte services recognized as research services are performed over the related performance periods for each contract 
we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual reimbursement rate per fte working on the project 
when up front payments are combined with fte services in a single unit of accounting  we recognize the up front payments using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition based upon the actual amount of research and development labor hours incurred relative to the amount of the total expected labor hours to be incurred by us  up to the amount of cash received 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  we are required to make estimates of the total hours required to perform our obligations 
research and development expenses related to fte services under the collaborative research and development agreements approximate the research funding over the term of the respective agreements 
a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and iii results in additional payments being due to us 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone i is commensurate with either our performance to 
table of contents achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii relates solely to past performance  and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms in the arrangement 
other payments received for which such payments are contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a collaborative partner s performance are recognized as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract terms and when such payments can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from royalties based on licensees sales of products using our technologies 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales in india and other emerging markets 
customers in these countries are subject to significant economic and other challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms which may exceed contractual payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  we may offer selected customers such payment flexibility 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable  and accordingly  we defer revenue until payment is received 
the costs associated with such revenue deferral are also deferred and classified as other current assets in the financial statements 
product revenues are recognized once passage of title and risk of loss has occurred and contractually specified acceptance criteria have been met  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have also been met 
product revenues consist of sales of biocatalysts  intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients and codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
cost of product revenues includes both internal and third party fixed and variable costs including amortization of purchased technology  materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs associated with our product revenues 
we licensed mutually agreed upon third party technology for use in our research and development collaboration with shell 
we recorded the license payments to research and development expense  offset by the related reimbursements received from shell 
these payments made by shell to us are direct reimbursements of our costs 
we accounted for these direct reimbursable costs as a net amount  whereby no expense or revenue is recorded for the costs reimbursed by shell 
for any payments not reimbursed by shell  we recognized these as expenses in the statement of operations 
we elected to present the reimbursements from shell as a component of our research and development expense since presenting the receipt of payment from shell as revenues does not reflect the substance of the arrangement 
we receive payments from government entities for work performed in the form of government awards 
government awards are agreements that generally provide us with cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
revenues from government awards are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government awards were provided have been met and we have only perfunctory obligations outstanding 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are recorded as revenues 
shipping costs are included in our cost of product revenues 
such charges were not significant in any of the periods presented 
milestone revenue we evaluated the nature of the milestone triggering the contingent payment  and concluded that the amount can be recognized as a milestone payment based on the facts that i the milestone was achieved through successful performance by us  ii the milestone was at risk at the inception of the arrangement  iii the milestone was substantive in nature and is non refundable  iv substantial effort was required by us to complete the milestone  v the amount of milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  and vi the milestone payment relates solely to past performance 
no further milestones payments are expected under this arrangement from this pharmaceutical partner 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to share based transactions  including the awarding of employee stock options and restricted stock units rsu  based on the estimated fair value of the awards granted 
we estimate the fair value of our stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
we calculate the estimated volatility rate based on historical volatility of our common stock 
due to our limited history of grant activity  we calculate the 
table of contents expected life of options granted to employees using the simplified method permitted by the united states securities exchange commission  or sec  as the average of the total contractual term of the option and its vesting period 
the risk free rate assumption was based on united states treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the terms of our stock options 
the expected dividend assumption was based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we account for stock options issued to non employees based on their estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the options granted to non employees is re measured as they vest  and the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets long lived and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
the company intangible assets with finite lives consist of customer relationships  developed core technology  trade names  and the intellectual property ip rights associated with the acquisition of maxygen directed evolution technology in intangible assets were recorded at their fair values at the date we acquired the assets and  for those assets having finite useful lives  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  and other non current assets 
we determined that we have a single entity wide asset group asset group 
the directed evolution technology patent portfolio acquired from maxygen core ip is the most significant component of the asset group since it is the base technology for all aspects of our research and development  and represents the basis for all of our identifiable cash flow generating capacity 
consequently  we do not believe that identification of independent cash flows associated with our long lived assets is currently possible at any lower level than the asset group 
the core ip is the only finite lived intangible asset on our balance sheet as of december  and is considered the primary asset within the asset group 
the remaining useful life of the core ip extends through the fourth quarter of there has been no significant change in the utilization or estimated life of our core ip since we acquired the technology patent portfolio from maxygen 
the estimated remaining useful life of our core ip is not impacted by the termination of the shell research agreement 
the carrying value of our long lived assets in the asset group may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment which could include a significant decrease in the market price of the company common stock  current period cash flow losses or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the assets  slower growth rates in our industry  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the assets  loss of significant customers or partners  or the current expectation that the assets will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of their estimated useful life 
we evaluate recoverability of our long lived assets and intangible assets based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use  and the eventual disposal of  the asset group 
we make estimates and judgments about the future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset group 
our anticipated future cash flows include our estimates of existing or in process product revenues  production and operating costs  future capital expenditures  working capital needs  and assumptions regarding the ultimate sale of the asset group at the end of the life of the primary asset 
the useful life of the asset group was based on the remaining useful life of the core ip  the primary asset 
as of december  we determined that our continued operating losses and the termination of the shell research agreement were indications of impairment 
consequently  we tested our long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment as of december  as part of a comprehensive strategic planning exercise the company undertook in the fourth quarter of and early  we developed a detailed multi year operating plan of both revenue and expense 
our best estimate of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of the asset group as of december  was developed directly from this plan using a forecast period consistent with the remaining useful life of the core ip 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to our asset group over its estimated remaining useful life 
the undiscounted cash flows included revenue and expense from our core pharmaceutical business and other enzyme markets adjacent to our pharmaceutical business 
these adjacent enzyme businesses  which will leverage our core ip and 
table of contents pharmaceutical technology and processes  include business opportunities in the fine chemical and enzymatic therapeutic markets 
we typically receive revenues from our core pharmaceutical business and expect to receive revenues from other enzyme markets adjacent to our pharmaceutical business in the form of one or more of the following up front payments  milestone payments  payments based upon the number of full time employee equivalents  or ftes  engaged in related research and development activities and licensing fees and royalties 
our best estimate of future cash flows does not include any codexol and codexyme revenues associated with collaboration research and development agreements  but does include an estimate of cash flows from potential strategic transactions with respect to our codexyme and codexol programs  as described below 
approximately and of total company revenues included in our estimated undiscounted cash flows excluding cash flows from potential strategic transactions with respect to our codexyme and codexol programs over the remaining useful life of the core ip are derived from our core pharmaceutical business and adjacent enzyme opportunities  respectively 
our core pharmaceutical business revenues are estimated based on existing commercial relationships  signed agreements or contracts  and conservative estimates for the capture of additional market share that management determined to be reasonably achievable 
for existing and in process customer revenues we assumed a modest rate of growth based on our historical business model for our core pharmaceutical business  including research and development services revenue from partners and customers  which management determined to be reasonably achievable 
we have historically worked closely with our pharmaceutical partners  such as merck  to evolve  engineer and develop enzymes that meet their specific needs 
our business model is based on having our partners and customers pay in whole or in part for the research and development required to engineer the enzymes required 
in determining which adjacent enzyme markets to exploit  management assessed various segments of the large and growing enzyme markets and selected those adjacent markets where we already had entry points through our existing pharmaceutical business relationships  such as fine chemicals and enzymatic therapeutics markets 
estimated revenues associated with these adjacent markets are based on market penetration and adoption rates that management determined to be reasonably achievable 
we calculated our expected residual value in by applying a gordon growth model to our estimated normalized net cash flows using a discount rate of estimated weighted average cost of capital  long term growth rate of  and a capitalization factor of 
the discount rate reflects the nature and the risk of the underlying forecast  and includes such financial components as the risk free rate  systemic stock price risk based on an evaluation with peer companies beta  equity risk premium  size premium  and company specific risk 
the long term growth rate of reflects projected inflation and general economic conditions 
based on these estimates  judgments  and factors  we determined that the residual value included in the undiscounted cash flows was million 
we also included in the undiscounted cash flows an estimate of cash flows from potential strategic transactions with respect to our existing codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohols programs 
the amount of estimated cash flows was determined by probability weighting different scenarios to derive at a weighted average of most probable outcomes  with codexol and codexyme representing and  respectively  of the total undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group 
these amounts are not based on any existing signed contracts or agreements 
the result of our fourth quarter impairment analysis indicates that the undiscounted cash flows for the asset group are greater than the carrying value of the asset group by approximately 
any inability to align future production costs  operating costs  capital expenditures and working capital needs with significant changes in the timing and or level of estimated future revenue could adversely impact our projected undiscounted cash flows 
future changes in the estimated useful life of our long lived assets could also adversely impact our projected undiscounted cash flows and result in future impairment charges 
if it is determined that the asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible and long lived assets over the fair value 
any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
we determined that the company has only one operating segment and reporting unit under the criteria in asc  segment reporting  and accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the company 
our review of goodwill for indicators of impairment is performed at the company level 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
we use our market capitalization as an indicator of fair value 
we believe that since our reporting unit is publicly traded  the ability of a controlling shareholder to benefit from synergies and other intangible assets that arise from control might cause the fair value of our reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization 
however  we believe that the fair value measurement need not be based solely on the quoted market price of an individual share of our common stock  but also can consider the impact of a control premium in measuring the fair value of our reporting unit 
should our market capitalization be less than our total stockholder equity as of our annual test date or as of any interim impairment testing date  we would also consider market comparables  recent trends in our stock price over a reasonable period and  if appropriate  use an income approach discounted cash flow to determine whether the fair value of our reporting unit is greater than our carrying amount 
if we were to use an income approach we would establish a fair value by estimating the present value of our projected future cash flows expected to be generated from our business 
the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value would be intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows 
our discounted cash flow methodology would consider projections of financial performance for a period of several years combined with an estimated residual value 
the most significant assumptions we would use in a discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate  the residual value and expected future revenues  gross margins and operating costs  along with considering any implied control premium 
the second step  if required  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all identified assets and liabilities 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of october   the date of the company annual impairment review 
the company concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment existed 
no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december   and income tax provision we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the future 
we have recorded a deferred tax asset in jurisdictions where ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not to occur 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes as required by the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate 
table of contents settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
the tax reform act of and similar state provisions limit the use of net operating loss carryforwards in certain situations where equity transactions result in a change of ownership as defined by internal revenue code section in the event we should experience an ownership change  as defined  utilization of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards could be limited

due to the new arch enzyme supply agreement  as described above  which became effective on november   we expect the resulting decrease in sales of statin family of products will result in a decrease in our product revenues in all future periods 
additionally  product revenues from our products used in on patent pharmaceuticals decreased during compared to by million  specifically million for products used in hepatitis c therapies  million for products used in cancer therapies  and million for products used in diabetic therapies 
the decrease is primarily due to the delay of product orders of our products used in hepatitis c and diabetic therapies from late to early further  the decrease in for products used in cancer therapies is primarily due to the accelerated manufacturing process development and drug qualification by an innovator pharmaceutical manufacturer in we expect that our product revenues from products used in cancer therapies in will remain comparable with collaborative research and development revenues were million for and consisted of million in revenues under the shell research agreement and million for collaborative research and development revenues from pharmaceutical customers 
our collaborative research agreement with shell terminated effective august  and as a result  our collaborative research and development revenues derived from shell decreased million to million in compared to million in this decrease is also a result of no shell milestone payments earned during while million were earned during we had an average of ftes in this collaboration until the termination on august  during  we had an average of ftes in this collaboration

we have historically experienced negative cash flow from operations as we continue to invest in our infrastructure  our technology platform  and expand our business 
our cash flows from operations will continue to be affected principally by our headcount  primarily in research and development 
the timing of hiring of skilled research and development personnel affects cash flows in particular as there is a lag between the hiring of research and development personnel and the generation of collaboration or product revenues and cash flows from those personnel 
our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is cash receipts from our customers for purchases of products from us or research and development services 
our largest uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures  rent payments  inventory purchases to support our product revenue and non payroll research and development costs 
we currently intend to continue our investment in research and development

if we are unable to agree to terms with new collaborators that provide us with the financial assistance and infrastructure necessary for us to develop and commercialize our products and execute our strategy with respect to codexyme cellulase enzymes  or if we are unable to identify and effect attractive strategic options for that program  we may need to fund this development ourselves  which will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition  or we may need to suspend the program  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
as a result of the expected significant decrease in revenues following the termination of the shell research agreement  we implemented a significant restructuring plan in the third quarter of this restructuring plan  when completed in early  will result in the closure of our research facility in singapore  the closure of a facility in redwood city and the termination of approximately of our more than employees worldwide 
as a result of these cost reductions  we anticipate total operating cost reduction of million for the year ended december  although we believe that  based on our current level of operations  our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next months  we may need additional capital if our current plans and assumptions change 
our need for additional capital will depend on many factors  including the financial success of our pharmaceutical business  identifying business partners to fund our cellulase program and our codexol detergent alcohol program  or identifying other strategic options with respect to such programs  our spending to develop and commercialize new and existing products  the effect of any acquisitions of other businesses  technologies or facilities that we may make or develop in the future  our spending on new market opportunities  including bio based chemicals  and the filing  prosecution  enforcement and defense of patent claims 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet our capital requirements  and we are unable to enter into or maintain collaborations with partners that are able or willing to fund our development efforts or commercialize any products that we develop or enable  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technology and products and complete the commercialization of products  if any  resulting from our technologies 
if future financings involve the issuance of 
table of contents equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
if we raise debt financing  we may be subject to restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business

if we fail to raise sufficient funds and fail to generate sufficient revenues to achieve planned gross margins and to control operating costs  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research or development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us

additionally  the new guidance requires quantitative information about unobservable inputs  and disclosure of the valuation processes used and narrative descriptions with regard to fair value measurements within the level categorization of the fair value hierarchy

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and are held for working capital purposes 
we had current and non current marketable securities holdings of million and million  respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in corporate bonds  commercial paper  and united states government obligations and united states government sponsored enterprise securities and are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe we do not have material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates fell by in  our interest income would have declined by approximately  assuming consistent investment levels 
foreign currency risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  austria  belgium  france  germany  italy  japan and india  as well as research activities in countries outside the united states  including singapore and hungary 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  we purchase materials for  and pay employees at  our research facility in hungary in hungarian forint 
in addition  we purchase products for sale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the united states dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into united states dollars 
although it is possible to do so  we have not hedged our foreign currency since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
although substantially all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
the effect of a adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated receivables as of december  would have been a million foreign exchange loss recognized as a component of interest expense and other  net in our consolidated statement of operations 
we may consider hedging for our foreign currency risk in the future 
equity price risk as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have an investment in common shares of co solutions inc  a company based in quebec city  canada  or co solutions  whose shares are publicly traded in canada on the tsx venture exchange 
during  we evaluated our investment in the common shares of co solutions 
at the time of the evaluation the fair value of our investment in co solutions common stock was million and our carrying cost for the investment was million and we determine the impairment was other than temporary considering the length of time and extent to which the fair value had been less than our cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of co solutions  and our management s ability and intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers 
as a result of our analysis  we recorded an impairment of million during as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations as selling  general and administrative expense 
this investment is exposed to fluctuations in both the market price of co solutions common shares and changes in the exchange rates between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
the effect of a adverse change in the market price of co solutions common shares as of december  would have been an unrealized loss of approximately  recognized as a component of our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss 
the effect of a adverse change in the exchange rates between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar as of december  would have been an unrealized loss of approximately  recognized as a component of our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss
