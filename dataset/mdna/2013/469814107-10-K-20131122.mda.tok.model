significant customers the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute or more of the company s total revenues 
on occasion  however  we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which  primarily because of the amount of pass through costs discussed below that is included in revenue  will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed of total consolidated revenues 
for the fiscal year ended october  revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for of total consolidated revenues

table of contents contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into two broad categories cost reimbursable and fixed price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years cost reimbursable fixed price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client  which is discussed in greater detail in item a risk factors 
in such situations  our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both lump sum bid contracts and negotiated fixed price contracts 
under lump sum bid contracts  we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
additionally  it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
accordingly  lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract 
in contrast  under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services  rather than turn key construction 
competition for information regarding the competitive conditions in our business  please refer to item a risk factors  below 
employees at september   we had approximately  full time  staff employees including contract staff 
additionally  as of september   there were approximately  persons employed in the field on a project basis 
the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

table of contents item a 
risk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future 
we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial 
if any such events actually occur  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces 
if we fail to maintain safe work sites  we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 
construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment  moving vehicles  chemical and manufacturing processes  and highly regulated materials 
on many sites we are responsible for safety and  accordingly  must implement safety procedures 
if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective  our employees and others may become injured 
unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover  increase the cost of a project to our clients  and raise our operating costs 
any of the foregoing could result in financial losses  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials  which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety 
although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health  safety  and environmental hse work procedures throughout our organization  including construction sites and maintenance sites  the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 
our safety record is critical to our reputation 
many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures 
as a result  our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients  and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services 
our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards could result in large damages 
our engineering practice  for example  involves professional judgments regarding the planning  design  development  construction  operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects 
while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages  and although we have adopted a range of insurance  risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities  a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability  warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm  especially if public safety is impacted 
these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate  or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future 
in addition  clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us 
an uninsured claim  either in part or in whole  if successful and of a material magnitude  could have a substantial impact on our operations 
the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business 
since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others  we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project 
such claims could relate to  among other things  personal injury  loss of life  business interruption  property damage  pollution  and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties  such as those who use or reside near our clients projects 
we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met 
in many of our contracts with clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages  penalties  losses  and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts 
in addition  while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities  such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 
page 
table of contents we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums  and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make 
in addition  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under these programs 
as a result  we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
our insurers are also subject to business risk and  as a result  one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 
in addition  the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors  and vendors presenting claims to us for  among other things  recovery of costs related to certain projects 
similarly  we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients  subcontractors  and vendors 
if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we could incur cost overruns  reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for a project 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results 
additionally  irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders  the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 
litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur 
pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability  product liability  criminal liability  warranty obligations  and other liabilities which  to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed price contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixed price in nature 
for these contracts  we bear the risk of paying some  if not all  of any cost overruns 
fixed price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions  including those about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications  or if circumstances change due to  among other things  unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  changes in the costs of raw materials  or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform  then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
if the project is significant  or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects  costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty 
we provide technical  professional  construction  and o m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration  production  and refining  programs for various national governments  including the us federal government  chemicals and polymers  mining and minerals  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  infrastructure  buildings  power  and other  general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  and food and consumer products 
these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been  and we expect will continue to be  cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control  including economic conditions and changes in client spending  particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 
current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients ability and willingness to fund their projects 
they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures  alter the mix of services purchased  seek more favorable price and other contract terms  and otherwise slow their spending on our services 
for example  in the public sector  declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending 
in addition  due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable 
these conditions have reduced the demand for our services  which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 
current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients  our vendors  and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients markets 
in addition  our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and  therefore  may not page 
table of contents recover as quickly as the economy at large 
a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regardless of economic or market conditions  investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost 
because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards  we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions 
as a result  our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 
fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation  delays in existing work  or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 
commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways 
for example  for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil  gas  copper  or fertilizers  fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and  therefore  their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments 
to the extent commodity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects  the demand for our services decreases  which may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects 
rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned  as well as those in progress  and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects 
cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire  retain  and utilize qualified personnel 
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire  retain  and utilize qualified personnel  including engineers  architects  designers  craft personnel  and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise 
from time to time  it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients 
in certain geographic areas  for example  we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 
in addition  as some of our key personnel approach retirement age  we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the cost of providing our services  including the extent to which we utilize our workforce  affects our profitability 
for example  the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur costs resulting from excess staff  reductions in staff  or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial conditions  and results of operations 
contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 
contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies  which are a significant source of our revenue and profit  are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions  and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration 
contracts with the us federal government  for example  are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding 
governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 
as a result  our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice 
since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example  those with the us federal government represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
page 
table of contents most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process 
the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple year contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract 
this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs 
moreover  we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under represented minorities 
our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements  which affects how we transact business with our clients and  in some instances  impose additional costs on our business operations 
for example  for contracts with the us federal government  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards  the service contract act  and numerous regulations governing  environmental protection  and employment practices 
government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non government contracts 
this includes  for example  unlimited indemnification obligations 
we also are subject to government audits  investigations  and proceedings 
for example  government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations 
these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 
if we violate a rule or regulation  fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit  a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties 
in addition  any or all of our government contracts could be terminated  we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work  or payment of our costs could be disallowed 
for example  in so called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws  treble damages can be awarded 
the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances  which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain 
if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances  our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts 
to the extent this occurs  our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted  cancelled or suspended by our clients and  therefore  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 
additionally  even if fully performed  our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 
as of the end of fiscal  our backlog totaled approximately billion 
there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or  if realized  will result in profits 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation  termination  or suspension at the discretion of the client 
in addition  the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts 
the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates 
projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project 
the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide spread economic slowdowns 
additionally  the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence  future profitability 
in some markets  there is a continuing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
typically  our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs  overall safety performance  overall client satisfaction  and other performance criteria 
if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards  we may receive a lower  or even zero  incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog  assuming they produce the revenues currently expected  will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 
page 
table of contents negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems 
although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations  at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions 
in addition  some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects 
instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad  could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain 
this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds  refinance our existing indebtedness  enter into agreements for new indebtedness  or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit  which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business 
in addition  market conditions could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and  therefore  utilize our services  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us 
we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors  suppliers  and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets 
if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients  we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients 
these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients  which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation  business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are  therefore  subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices 
in weak economic environments  we may experience increased delays and failures due to  among other reasons  a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets 
if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables  it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations 
furthermore  our cash balances and short term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america  europe  south america  australia and asia 
some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance 
although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership  or have been seized by their governments  there is a risk that this may occur in the future 
if this were to occur  we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 
our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control 
as is common in the industry  we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures  partnerships  and similar arrangements 
this situation exposes us to a number of risks  including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 
our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships 
if these circumstances occur  we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages  provide additional services  or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
under agreements with joint and several liabilities  we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners 
these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients  all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation  business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner 
in these cases  we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture 
these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow 
to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws  regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and  for government clients  could result in fines  penalties  suspension or even debarment being imposed on us  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
page 
table of contents we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 
much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third party subcontractors we hire 
we also rely on third party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects 
if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers  our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired 
if we are not able to locate qualified third party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated  especially in a lump sum or a fixed price contract  we may suffer losses on these contracts 
if a subcontractor  supplier  or manufacturer fails to provide services  supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason  we may be required to source these services  equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms  which could impact contract profitability 
in the current economic environment  third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations 
the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party s ability to provide materials  equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  a failure by a third party subcontractor  supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws  regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and  for government clients  could result in fines  penalties  suspension or even debarment being imposed on us  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
historically  we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but  as is typically the case  the issuance of a bond is at the surety s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company credit worthiness 
because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity  we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost 
there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms 
our inability to obtain adequate bonding and  as a result  to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
past and future environmental  heath  and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 
we are subject to a variety of environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  discharges to air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety 
these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost 
violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 
various us federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities 
these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants 
the liability under these laws is joint and several 
we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties 
the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
when we perform our services  our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions 
we may be subject to liability claims by employees  customers  and third parties as a result of such exposures 
in addition  we may be subject to fines  penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws 
a claim  if not covered by insurance  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
such laws  regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could  for example  relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment  which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and  in turn  could negatively impact our revenue 
our failure to comply with such laws or regulations  whether actual or alleged  could expose us to fines  penalties or potential litigation liabilities  including costs  settlements and judgments  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
page 
table of contents in addition  we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments  which may require us or our clients to obtain  and to comply with  federal  state  and local government permits and approvals 
any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial  revocation or modification under various circumstances 
failure to obtain or comply with  or the loss or modification of  the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and result of operations 
if we fail to comply with federal  state  local or foreign governmental requirements  our business may be adversely affected 
we are subject to us federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business 
for example  our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders 
although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws  the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines  or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges  and could damage our reputation and therefore  our ability to do business 
employee  agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts  which could result in reduced revenues and profits 
misconduct  fraud  non compliance with applicable laws and regulations  or other improper activities by one of our employees  agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation 
such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations  regulations regarding the protection of classified information  regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices  regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts  regulations on lobbying or similar activities  regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting  environmental laws  and any other applicable laws or regulations 
for example  we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters  if a security breach were to occur  our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective  and we could face unknown risks or losses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties  loss of security clearance  and suspension or debarment from contracting  which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  the us bribery act of  and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
despite our training and compliance programs  there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 
a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  in fiscal   and fiscal  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our significant clients  our clients may unilaterally reduce  delay  or cancel their contracts at any time 
our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we engage in a highly competitive business 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we face intense competition to provide technical  professional  and construction services to clients 
the extent of such competition varies by industry  geographic market  and project type 
for example  with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services  clients generally award large projects to large contractors  which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects 
conversely  with respect to our engineering  design  architectural  page 
table of contents and consulting services  low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller  newer competitors 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both  which if significant  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our larger competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel  fluor  foster wheeler  kbr  technip  worleyparsons  cb i  and amec 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  hok  aecom  and turner 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs  parsons brinckerhoff  hntb  tetra tech  parsons  and ws atkins 
in the area of national government programs  our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as leidos  chm hill  weston  lockheed martin  and computer sciences corporation 
in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors  our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations  and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including recessions and other economic crises in other regions  such as europe  or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including logistical and communication challenges  unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements  lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights  renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts  the adoption of new  and the expansion of existing  trade or other restrictions  embargoes  acts of war  civil unrest  force majeure  and terrorism  the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations  social  political  and economic instability  expropriation of property  tax increases  limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings  and us government policies 
the lack of a well developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights 
in addition  military action or continued unrest  particularly in the middle east  could impact the supply or pricing of oil  disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere 
to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic  political and other conditions  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we work in international locations where there are high security risks  which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 
some of our services are performed in high risk locations  where the country or location is subject to political  social or economic risks  or war or civil unrest 
in those locations where we have employees or operations  we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel 
despite these activities  in these locations  we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 
our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures  we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk  particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative page 
table of contents hedging instruments  when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts 
these actions  however  may not always eliminate currency risk exposure 
based on fluctuations in currency  the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly 
we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 
our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our business strategy involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
acquiring companies presents a number of risks  including assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated  valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single  integrated  and efficient business  the effects of diverting management s attention from day to day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services  and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities  increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative  internal control and operating systems  which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities  and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business 
while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses  such rights may be difficult to enforce  the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds  and the indemnitors may not have ability to financially support the indemnity 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
existing cash balances and cash flow from operations  together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions 
acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make  we could dilute share ownership 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
accordingly  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s on december  if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise  such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company 
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock  because of a number of factors  including fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers  the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter  unanticipated changes in contract performance  particularly with contracts that have funding limits  the timing of resolving change orders  requests for equitable adjustments  and other contract adjustments  delays incurred in connection with a project  page 
table of contents changes in prices of commodities or other supplies  weather conditions that delay work at project sites  the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives  natural disasters or other crises  staff levels and utilization rates  changes in prices of services offered by our competitors  and general economic and political conditions 
our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include recognition of contract revenue  costs  profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting  estimated amounts for expected project losses  warranty costs  contract close out or other costs  recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims  collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts  the amount of reserves necessary for self insured risks  accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation reserves  valuation of assets acquired  and liabilities  goodwill  and intangible assets assumed  in acquisitions  valuation of stock based compensation  and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post retirement benefit programs 
our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results  which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
under us gaap  we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach 
as of september   we had billion of goodwill  representing of our total assets of billion 
we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 
we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business  potential government actions toward our facilities  and other factors 
if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken 
for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post retirement benefit plans we manage 
we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy  over time  our underfunded benefit obligations  which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets 
for example  as of september   and september   our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by million and million  respectively 
see note pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k for additional disclosure 
in the future  our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of page 
table of contents interest rates  pension plan asset performance and other factors 
if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans  our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
rising inflation  interest rates  and or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts  in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts 
rising inflation  interest rates  or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services 
in addition  we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed price 
because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost reimbursable type contracts approximately during fiscal  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor 
however  if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
therefore  increases in inflation  interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 
growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations 
for example  there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning  among other things  greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients 
legislation  international protocols  regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients  including those who are involved in the exploration  production or refining of fossil fuels 
such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or  in some cases  prevent a project from going forward  thereby potentially reducing the need for our services  which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
however  these changes could also increase the pace of projects  such as carbon capture or storage projects  that could have a positive impact on our business 
we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 
our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable  they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation  the introduction of new tax accounting standards  legislation  regulations  and related interpretations  our global mix of earnings  the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 
we rely heavily on computer  information  and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business 
from time to time  we experience occasional system interruptions and delays 
in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware  effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure  and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems  the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss  corruption  or release of data 
in addition  our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters  telecommunications failures  acts of war or terrorism  computer viruses  physical or electronic security breaches  intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error  or similar events or disruptions 
any of these or other events could cause interruptions  delays  loss of critical and or sensitive data or similar effects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  protection of intellectual property  and results of operations  as well as those of our clients 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 
our technology and intellectual property provide us  in many instances  with a competitive advantage 
although we protect our property through patent registrations  license restrictions  and similar mechanisms  we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or become obsolete 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us  our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced 
in addition  our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property 
there is a risk we page 
table of contents may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and  as a result  could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities  loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 
extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control  such as natural or man made disasters  could negatively impact our ability to operate 
as an example  from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed price contract  evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services  increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding  inability to deliver materials  equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity 
we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man made event  unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations 
if we are not able to react quickly to such events  or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man made catastrophe  our operations may be significantly affected  which could have a negative impact on our operations 
in addition  if we cannot complete our contracts on time  we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 
we are subject to professional standards  duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue  which could subject us to monetary damages 
we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards  duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services 
for example  we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings 
if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible  we could be subject to significant monetary damages 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us 
in addition  certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board  there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions  as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
accordingly  stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows  a reader of this management s discussion and analysis md a should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long term engineering and construction type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k  the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contract  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule  the costs of materials and labor  productivity  and the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements  fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates  target costs  and or other performance criteria 
failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on all relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients  we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract  we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 
as is common to the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums 
although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients  the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners  or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures 
the assets of our joint ventures  therefore  consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients  and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors 
in general  at any given time  the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients 
very few of our joint ventures have employees 
none of our joint ventures have third party debt or credit facilities 
our joint ventures  therefore  are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients 
rarely do they  in and of themselves  present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate page 
table of contents from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own 
under us gaap  our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures  if and when they occur  has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
in evaluating the company joint ventures also referred to as variable interest entities  or vies for accounting and consolidation purposes  we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a controlling financial interest in the vie 
the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance  and ii the right to receive benefits  or obligation to absorb losses  that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in making our qualitative analysis  the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and whether the company  another entity  or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities 
if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie  then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie 
if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties  then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie 
for the company unconsolidated joint ventures  we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional conslidation 
the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest 
there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the black scholes option pricing model 
like all option pricing models  the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock  and ii the expected term of the award  among others 
accordingly  changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards 
for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company  compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations 
due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying monte carlo simulations  the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future 
accounting for pension plans the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal range from to  compared to to for the prior year 
we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering recent market conditions  projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal these assumptions represent the company s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 
changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
for example  if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation pbo at september   was higher lower by  the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately million for non us plans  and by approximately million for us plans 
if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by  the net periodic pension cost for fiscal would be lower higher by approximately million for non us plans  and by approximately million for non us plans 
differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie  actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap 
management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used

table of contents contractual guarantees  litigation  investigations  and insurance in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we have elected  however  to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs 
this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured  and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 
in accordance with us gaap  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees  litigation  and insurance claims 
we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations  and claims by  or on behalf of  the us federal government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 
testing goodwill for possible impairment the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment 
in performing the annual impairment test  we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  which are based on geography 
we refer to these reporting units internally as europe and non europe 
each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this form k  which includes providing professional technical services such as design  engineering  and architectural services  construction and or construction management services  and operations and maintenance services 
our geography based reporting units reflect the company s organizational structure  which is based predominately on geography  as well as our acquisition strategy  which favors acquisition targets that  among other things  provide access to new geographic areas 
our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheets have been assimilated  and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 
us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units 
the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
for fiscal year  we used a market approach for valuing our reporting units 
under this method  the fair value of our reporting units were estimated by multiplying their respective after tax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company s overall average market earnings multiple 
the key inputs used in the valuation model were the after tax earnings of our reporting units and the company s market driven average earnings multiple 
the multiple used for fiscal was approximately for fiscal years and  we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment 
such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments 
under the income approach  fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
under the market approach  the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units  the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies 
in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired  we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated 
the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values by over 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in our testing were income approach assumptions company financial projections for fiscal years to weighted average cost of capital of residual period growth rate of page 
table of contents assumptions company financial projections for fiscal years to weighted average cost of capital of residual period growth rate of market approach with respect to the market approach  for guideline publicly traded companies reasonably comparable to the company reporting units  the company used multiples ranging from to of ebitda and to of ebit  for the fiscal year test applied to the trailing twelve months results of operations for each of our reporting units 
the company used multiples ranging from to of ebitda and to of ebit  for the fiscal year test applied to the projected fiscal year financial results for each of our reporting units 
it is possible that changes in market conditions  economy  facts and circumstances  judgments  and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change  resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future 
the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 
the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 
the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years   and based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests  there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets at either september   or september  furthermore  the company performed an interim impairment assessment at september   and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either reporting unit had been reduced to an amount below its carrying amount 
fiscal overview the company s net earnings increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the company growth in earnings this year was primarily facilitated by a strong performance in the chemicals and polymers industry 
included in earnings in the company fiscal was a one time  after tax gain of million  or per diluted share  related to the sale of the company intellectual property for iron ore pelletizing and other related assets pelletizing gain 
backlog at september   increased billion  or  to billion 
during the year the company had significant sales from clients operating in the oil gas upstream  chemicals and polymers  refining downstream  infrastructure  aerospace and defense  and buildings industry groups and markets

table of contents results of operations general our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional services and field services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services including engineering  design  architecture  interiors  planning  environmental  and similar services  process  scientific  and systems consulting services including services performed in connection with scientific testing  analysis  and consulting activities  as well as information technology and systems engineering and integration activities  construction services encompassing traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities  direct hire construction  and construction management services  and operations and maintenance services including services performed in connection with operating large  complex facilities on behalf of clients  as well as services involving process plant and facilities maintenance 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete single responsibility  design build contracts  to services required in the post start up phases of a project such as operations and maintenance services 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands technical professional services revenues project services process  scientific  and systems consulting total technical professional services revenues field services revenues construction operations and maintenance o m total field services revenues project services revenues for the year ended september   increased million  or  from the corresponding period last year 
these increases in project services revenues occurred principally in our north american and uk operations primarily in support of our clients in the chemicals and polymers and refining downstream markets 
process  scientific  and systems consulting revenues for the year ended september   decreased million  or  from the corresponding period last year 
the revenues in this service type primarily relate to science  engineering and technical support services provided to our us government clients 
these decreases can be attributed primarily to the winding down of one project for the us federal government 
construction revenues for the year ended september   increased million  or  from the corresponding period last year 
the company continues to experience increased activity in the oil gas upstream market  particularly in canada  in the chemicals and polymers market in the us and the us  and in the mining and minerals market in the us 
our operations and maintenance revenues for the year ended september   were relatively unchanged  although the mix of work changed 
operations and maintenance revenues in our national government programs increased million page 
table of contents for the year ended september  from the corresponding period last year  primarily as a result of an increase in our ownership of the business that manages and operates the strategic petroleum reserve for the us department of energy 
that increase was offset by a million decrease in our revenues related to our canadian operations for the year ended september  from the corresponding period last year 
nevertheless we expect to see increases in our maintenance activity in our canadian operations in the near term 
we focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets 
we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands chemicals and polymers refining downstream national government programs infrastructure oil gas upstream buildings mining minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industrial and other we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million  or per diluted share million  or per diluted share excluding the pelletizing gain  for the fiscal year ended september  revenues increased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas continue to influence activity in the chemicals market 
because there is now a large source of feedstock available outside refineries which can grow independently of the refining infrastructure  we believe more projects are now economically viable and capital is being deployed to develop these opportunities 
furthermore  our clients are looking at various options to monetize natural gas 
this increased activity is primarily in the us and the us along with smaller increases in the middle east and asia 
revenues from clients operating in the refining downstream market decreased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal included in revenues for fiscal were a significant amount of pass through costs for a large us based project that was winding down during fiscal notwithstanding these decreases  we had strong sales in this market during fiscal and believe it will continue to be a strong market during fiscal looking forward  several downstream companies have announced large capital projects and the industry is beginning to focus on compliance with the epa tier ultra low sulfur gasoline regulations where we believe we are well positioned to support our clients with the required facility modifications 
national government programs revenues for fiscal remained relatively flat compared to fiscal uncertainties over us government budget issues and ongoing sequestration concerns remained a primary driver limiting our growth in this market 
these actions had little effect on the company projects in backlog in this market during fiscal we believe that sequestration is slowing the release of new project opportunities in this market 
nevertheless  we had significant aerospace and defense awards in this market during fiscal in addition  certain recent changes in government contracting in the us have helped to stabilize this area of our business and may continue to help stabilize it in the future 
we have seen an increasing volume of work released by us government agencies in the form of multiple award task order contracts matoc 
these types of awards allow the company to bid on  and participate in  more government sites than large  single award contracts 
we believe our cost profile makes us very competitive for matoc type awards 
revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market decreased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal we believe the us market should benefit from several recent bond passages and we are leveraging our capabilities in the us and india into markets in the middle east and australia 
the uk market page 
table of contents should improve as the government has taken further action to increase the level of infrastructure spending 
we had significant wins in the us market in fiscal the partial us federal government shutdown has added some uncertainty to our us infrastructure market  though we are experiencing little short term disruption 
revenues from clients operating in the oil and gas upstream market increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal these increases were primarily a result of improvement in the canadian oil and gas business  particularly in field services 
the company expects field services activity in the canadian market to remain strong as we move into fiscal as projections continue to show a strong oil price forecast 
we continue to see more opportunities in the middle east  including unconventional gas development programs and large pipeline front end engineering and design feed projects 
the market in europe looks positive with a number of opportunities for engineering  procurement and construction management epcm projects  feed for onshore terminal modifications  and long term site based alliances 
onshore development and production in the us continues to be strong 
the australian market is being driven by the development of liquefied natural gas export projects 
revenues from clients operating in the buildings market decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the current state of the us economy is impacting this market and we view this market as being flat in fiscal we see momentum building in healthcare  k  higher education  federal civilian  state and local  and aviation that should see this market growing in fiscal our buildings business continues to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector 
opportunities in the private sector business are coming from mission critical  education  healthcare  aviation  and corporate and commercial programs and projects 
revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals market increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal generally  our clients in this market have been affected negatively by a general slowdown in the rate of growth in the chinese economy  falling spot prices for iron ore  coking  and thermal coal  and weaker commodity prices albeit these declines have occurred from prices that were generally high from a historical perspective 
these trends have resulted in clients reducing their capital spending in the mining and minerals market 
despite this cooling market  we were able to capture additional market share during fiscal the increase in revenues in this market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily from projects based out of the us as we move into fiscal the company is focusing on small cap projects and maintenance driven work for our clients in this market 
the potential for legislative changes during fiscal in australia could have a positive influence in this market as early as the later part of fiscal revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal though several of our customers have delayed projects  we view this market as steady  with potential growth prospects in the areas of biotechnology based drug development in europe and north america and secondary manufacturing expansion in asia  the uk  and south america 
as we move into fiscal we view this market as steady to slightly up in the us  us  ireland  and mainland europe 
we continue to view china as a strong market with the government emphasizing improvement in the nation healthcare system 
industrial and other includes the pulp paper  high technology manufacturing  power  and food  beverage consumer products industry groups and markets 
revenues from clients operating in the industrial and other markets increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increases in industrial and other revenues were due primarily to increased activity in the pulp paper market in the us and the high technology manufacturing market in ireland 
direct costs of contracts increased million  or  from billion during fiscal to billion during fiscal direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts  including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects 
the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of pass through costs we incur during a period 
on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as pass through costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not considered pass through costs and are  therefore  not reflected in either revenues or costs 
to the extent that we incur a significant amount of pass through costs in a period  our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 
pass through costs increased million  or  from billion during fiscal to billion for fiscal in general  pass through costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities 
pass through costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs page 
table of contents of our individual clients and the nature of the clients projects 
however  because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year  the effect of pass through costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
generally speaking  the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie  where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects  and or procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical  professional services revenues  the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues 
because revenues from pass through costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 
the increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal as compared to last year was due primarily to a slight decrease in margins for our professional services offset by improved margins for our field services 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion for fiscal the increase in sg a is primarily reflective of the company increased business activity when compared to the corresponding periods last year 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a costs have declined for fiscal as compared to the corresponding period last year 
interest expense for fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal interest expense in both fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal when compared to fiscal is related primarily to the accrual of interest related to a potential tax liability from an acquisition completed in fiscal the company s consolidated effective income tax rate was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal the company lower effective income tax rate in fiscal when compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the us  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the us we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share million  or per diluted share excluding the pelletizing gain  for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended september  revenues increased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas had an impact on the chemicals market in fiscal revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to a number of new and continuing projects  including projects relating to vaccine production facilities 
revenues from clients operating in the refining downstream market increased million  or  from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher business volume principally within the company operations in the us and canada 
revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals market increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of the revenues of the aker entities for all of fiscal  versus only a portion of fiscal the aker entities refer to certain businesses that were acquired in separate transactions that were completed in february and april  and which are described page

revenues from clients operating in the oil and gas upstream market increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase is related primarily to higher business volume in the company canadian operations 
national government programs revenues for fiscal were relatively flat compared to fiscal we believe that uncertainties associated with sequestration ie  that mechanism within the budget control act of that can trigger automatic us government spending cuts in the event the us congress and the president fail to agree on a budget by the end of calendar caused several agencies to slow the release of work in nevertheless  certain recent changes in government contracting in the us have helped to stabilize this area of our business and may continue to help stabilize it in the future 
we have seen an increasing volume of work released by us government agencies in the form of multiple award task order contracts matoc 
these types of awards allow the company to bid on  and participate in  more government sites than large  single award contracts 
we believe our cost profile makes us very competitive for matoc type awards 
revenues from clients operating in the buildings market decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal during the year we saw shifts in this industry group towards projects for clients in the private sector  which was driven by a continuing decline in government spending 
growth in the private sector business came from mission critical  education  healthcare  aviation  and corporate and commercial programs and projects

contributing to this increase was higher average cash balances on deposit in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense for fiscal increased million  as compared to fiscal interest expense in both fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities 
the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of interest expense associated with acquisition indebtedness for all of fiscal  versus only a portion of fiscal the company s consolidated effective income tax rate was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal in general  the lower effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the changing geographical source of our earnings combined with an increase in the utilization of us foreign tax credits

b assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal  allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases  but limited to the amount recorded as of september  actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including amounts required by local laws and regulations  and other funding requirements 
c assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal  allowing for certain growth 
due to the nonqualified nature of the plans  and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service  the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of september  d represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of september   primarily accounts payable and accrued payroll

backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
with respect to o m contracts  however  we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for national government programs other than us federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  excluding option periods 
page 
table of contents the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions technical professional services field services total the entire value of contract awards are added to backlog when the contracts are awarded to us 
accordingly  backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years 
our backlog at september  increased by billion  or  to billion from billion at september  the increase in backlog from september  to september  was due primarily to new awards from clients operating in the oil gas upstream  chemicals and polymers  refining downstream  infrastructure  aerospace and defense  and buildings industry groups and markets 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
accordingly  backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 
backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately billion or of total backlog  billion or of total backlog  and billion or of total backlog at september   september   and september   respectively 
most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
subject to the factors discussed in item a risk factors  above  we estimate that approximately billion  or  of total backlog at september  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item a risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources at september   our primary sources of liquidity consisted of billion of cash and cash equivalents and million of available borrowing capacity under our billion unsecured revolving credit facility 
we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million from billion at september  to billion at september  this compares to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during the corresponding period last year 
during fiscal we experienced net cash inflows of million from operating activities 
these cash inflows were offset by cash outflows of million from investing activities and million from financing activities  along with million from the effects of exchange rate changes 
operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in net earnings attributable to the group  a million favorable change in the company working capital accounts  a million change related to the company defined benefit pension plans  and a million change related to stock based compensation 
because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on cost plus type contracts  and due to the significance of revenues relating to pass through costs  most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients 
although we continually monitor our accounts receivable  we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working page 
table of contents capital accounts in total  rather than by the individual elements 
the primary elements of the company s working capital accounts are accounts receivable  accounts payable  and billings in excess of cost 
accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients 
accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients a substantial portion of which is for project related costs 
billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 
this relationship between revenues and costs  and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry  and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level 
the changes in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts were due simply to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and is not indicative of any known trend or fundamental change to the underlying business 
we still continue to experience delays in certain payments and have seen an increase in the length of payment terms with certain customers 
we believe that this situation does not present a significant risk to the company cash flows 
we believe the risk of not collecting substantially all of the company outstanding receivables is remote 
though the company provides services in a number of countries outside the us  we believe our credit risk is not significant 
our private sector customers are comprised principally of large  well known  and well established multi national companies 
our government customers are comprised of national  state  and local agencies located principally in the us and the us we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with either of our governmental or non governmental customers 
we used million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal this compares to million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the company did not engage in any significant financing activity during fiscal additions to property and equipment totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
included in fiscal activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space  expansion of office space 
and relocations of certain office space  all occurring in a number of locations 
our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this compares to net cash inflows of million during fiscal the million net increase in cash outflows from financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the net decrease in the company outstanding debt 
the company had billion of cash and short term equivalents at september  of this amount  approximately million was held in the us and million was held outside of the us  primarily in canada  the uk  and the eurozone 
other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the us to the us see note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k  there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us the total amount utilized under the facility at september  was million million in the form of direct borrowings and million utilized in the form of letters of credit 
please refer to note borrowings of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the facility 
we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations  support our acquisition strategy  and service our debt for the next twelve months 
we had billion in cash and cash equivalents at september   compared to billion at september  our consolidated working capital position at september  was billion  an increase of million from september  as noted in the company form k dated september   we entered into a merger implementation deed with sinclair knight merz skm  a  person professional services firm headquartered in australia for an estimated purchase price of billion 
the company has adequate cash and existing debt capacity to finance this transaction and fund our operations 
additionally  there was million of borrowing capacity available at september  under the facility 
we believe that the remaining capacity  terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility  combined with cash on hand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place  are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 
page 
table of contents the company had million of letters of credit outstanding at september  of this amount  million were issued under the facility and million were issued under separate  committed and uncommitted letter of credit facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business
