trends and uncertainties industry production volumes the following table reflects estimated commercial truck production volumes for selected original equipment oe markets based on available sources and management s estimates 
year ended september  estimated commercial truck production in thousands north america  heavy duty trucks north america  medium duty trucks western europe  heavy and medium duty trucks south america  heavy and medium duty trucks during fiscal year  we expect a slight increase in production volumes in north america compared to the levels experienced in fiscal year we anticipate a slight decrease in production volumes in south america resulting from continued economic uncertainty during fiscal year during fiscal year  production volumes in europe are expected to ramp up in the first quarter of fiscal year in advance of the new commercial truck emission standard requirements  with a decline in production expected in the remainder of the year 
production volumes in the asia pacific region  more specifically china  are expected to remain unchanged during fiscal year compared to levels experienced in fiscal year we expect the market in india to be down another in fiscal year given the current economic climate 
there is no certainty as to if and when these volumes in the asia pacific region a return to the levels previously experienced in sales for our primary military program were at their peak during the third quarter of fiscal year and began to wind down beginning in fiscal year and is scheduled to terminate by the end of fiscal year we are working to secure our participation in new military programs with various oems 
however  failure to secure new military contracts could have a longer term negative impact on our commercial truck and industrial segment 
in addition  even if sales of our military programs do return to historic levels  the levels of profitability on these sales could be lower than what we have recognized in recent periods 
industry wide issues our business continues to address a number of other challenging industry wide issues including the following uncertainty around the global market outlook  volatility in price and availability of steel  components and other commodities  disruptions in the financial markets and their impact on the availability and cost of credit  higher energy and transportation costs  impact of currency exchange rate volatility  consolidation and globalization of oems and their suppliers  and significant pension and retiree medical health care costs 
other other significant factors that could affect our results and liquidity in fiscal year and beyond include significant contract awards or losses of existing contracts or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewals including  without limitation  negotiations with our largest customer  volvo  which are ongoing regarding our contract with volvo covering axle supply in europe  south america and australia  which is scheduled to expire in october  failure to obtain new business  failure to secure new military contracts as our primary military programs winds down  ability to manage possible adverse effects on our european operations  or financing arrangements related thereto  in the event one or more countries exit the european monetary union  ability to work with our customers to manage rapidly changing production volumes  ability to recover and timing of recovery of steel price and other cost increases from our customers  any unplanned extended shutdowns or production interruptions by us  our customers or our suppliers  a significant deterioration or slowdown in economic activity in the key markets in which we operate  higher than planned price reductions to our customers  potential price increases from our suppliers  additional restructuring actions and the timing and recognition of restructuring charges  higher than planned warranty expenses  including the outcome of known or potential recall campaigns  our ability to implement planned productivity  cost reduction  and other margin improvement initiatives  uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the outcome of litigation with insurance companies regarding the scope of coverage and the long term solvency of our insurance carriers  and restrictive government actions by foreign countries such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs 
non gaap financial measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we have provided information regarding non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures include adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  free cash flow  free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring payments and net debt including retirement liabilities 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations are defined as reported income or loss from continuing operations and reported diluted earnings or loss per share from continuing operations before restructuring expenses  asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management 
adjusted ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures  loss on sale of receivables  restructuring expenses  asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management 
adjusted ebitda margin is defined as adjusted ebitda divided by consolidated sales 
free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
net debt including retirement liabilities is defined as total debt plus pension assets  pension liability  retiree medical liability and other retirement benefits less cash and cash equivalents 
management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted income loss from continuing operations are meaningful measures of performance as they are commonly utilized by management and investors to analyze ongoing operating performance and entity valuation 
management  the investment community and banking institutions routinely use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting future periods 
in addition  we use segment ebitda as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments 
management believes that free cash flow and free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring are useful in analyzing our ability to service and repay debt 
net debt including retirement liabilities is a specific financial measure which is part of our three year plan  m  to reduce debt and other balance sheet liabilities 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
free cash flow and free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring should not be considered a substitute for cash provided by used for operating activities  or other cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of financial position or liquidity 
in addition  these non gaap cash flow measures do not reflect cash used to service debt or cash received from the divestitures of businesses or sales of other assets and thus do not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses 
these non gaap financial measures  as determined and presented by the company  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
net debt should not be considered a substitute for total debt as reported on the balance sheet
