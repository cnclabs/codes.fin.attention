item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is a significant accounting policy for the company 
the company recognizes revenue from time and materials contracts as services are performed 
during the years ended december   and  revenues from time and materials contracts constituted  and  respectively  of total revenues 
revenue from fixed price application management maintenance and support 
table of contents engagements is recognized as earned  which generally results in straight line revenue recognition as services are performed continuously over the term of the engagement 
during the years ended december   and  revenues from fixed price application management maintenance and support engagements constituted  and  respectively 
revenue on fixed price application development and integration projects is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting 
performance is generally measured based upon the efforts incurred to date in relation to the total estimated efforts to the completion of the contract 
the company monitors estimates of total contract revenues and cost on a routine basis throughout the delivery period 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimates of the contract revenues or costs is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on a particular contract  provision is made for the estimated loss 
the company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based on either the achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms 
differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue based upon the proportional performance method of accounting are recorded as revenue earned in excess of billings or deferred revenue in the accompanying financial statements 
during the years ended december   and  revenues from fixed price application development and integration contracts constituted  and  respectively 
significant accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
the use of the proportional performance method of accounting requires that the company make estimates about its future efforts and costs relative to the fixed price contracts 
while the company has procedures in place to monitor the estimates throughout the performance period  such estimates are subject to change as each contract progresses 
the cumulative impact of any such change is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of aged receivables 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents accruals for legal expenses and exposures 
the company is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls 
the company has not accrued any liability for legal contingencies as no legal contingency has been deemed to be probable of occurring 
the company s estimates regarding legal contingencies are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting  litigating and settling similar matters 
it is the opinion of management with respect to pending or threatened litigation matters that unfavorable outcomes are neither probable nor remote and that estimates of possible loss are not able to be made 
although actual amounts could differ from management s estimate  none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to the company s financial position or results of operations the company estimates the costs associated with known legal exposures and their related legal expenses and accrues reserves for either the probable liability  if that amount can be reasonably estimated  or otherwise the lower end of an estimated range of potential liability 
the accrual related to litigation at december  and was zero

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk the company considers investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities in thousands december  december  assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments total as at december   the total cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balance was million 
out of the above  an amount of million was held by indian subsidiaries which was comprised of an amount of million held in us dollars with the balance of the amount held in indian rupees 
the company believes that the amount of cash and cash equivalent outside the us will not have a material impact on liquidity 

table of contents the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s investments are in high quality indian mutual funds and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
at any time  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
the company strives to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations  or the company may suffer a loss in principal if the company is forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as stated above 
foreign currency risk the company s sales are primarily sourced in the united states and its subsidiary in the united kingdom and are mostly denominated in us dollars or uk pounds  respectively 
its foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the risk is partially mitigated as the company has sufficient resources in the respective local currencies to meet immediate requirements 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations 
the rupee depreciation has also resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of million during the year ended december   which has been reported as other comprehensive loss 
during the year ended december   the indian rupee has depreciated against the us dollar  by average  as compared to the year ended december  this rupee depreciation positively impacted the company s gross margin by basis points  operating income by basis points and net income by basis points  each as a percentage of revenue 
the indian rupee denominated cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expense was and of the expenses  respectively 
as at december   the indian rupee has depreciated against the us dollar  as compared to the rate at december  this rupee depreciation has adversely impacted the shareholders equity by approximately million as of december  although the company cannot predict future movement in interest rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates  the company does not currently anticipate that interest rate risk or foreign currency risk will have a significant impact 
in order to limit the exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  the company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts during the year ended december   but these contracts do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents during the year ended december   the company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge part of its revenues where the counter party is a bank 
the company considers the risks of non performance by the counterparty as not material 
no forward contracts are outstanding as on december net losses on foreign exchange forward and options contracts included under the heading other income in the statement of income amounted to million loss for the year ended december  based upon a sensitivity analysis of the aggregated contracted principal amounts of our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   a change in the indian foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately million 
as at december   no foreign exchange forward contracts were outstanding 
the company manages exposure to market risk by investing in high quality indian mutual funds  by adhering to policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  by avoiding use of any derivative financial instruments  by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts with only financially sound banks that have passed syntel internal review to hedge no more than of the company s india based entity revenue  and by generally  limiting foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to maturities of one to six months 
the company also specifically discloses any net gain or loss on contracts  which are not designated as hedges  under the heading of other income in the statement of income
