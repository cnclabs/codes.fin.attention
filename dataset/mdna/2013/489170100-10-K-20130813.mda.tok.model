item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of kennametal inc and the related financial statement notes 
unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june additionally  when used in this annual report on form k  unless the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to kennametal inc and its subsidiaries 
overview kennametal inc is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of tooling  engineered components and advanced materials consumed in production processes 
we deliver productivity to customers seeking peak performance in demanding environments by providing innovative custom and standard wear resistant solutions 
to provide these solutions  we harness our knowledge of advanced materials and application development with a commitment to environmental sustainability 
our solutions are built around industry essential technology platforms 
these include metalworking tools  engineered components  surface technologies and earth cutting tools that are mission critical to the performance of our customers battling extreme conditions such as fatigue wear  corrosion and high temperatures 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence  as well as our technological expertise and innovation we deliver in our products and services  help us to achieve a leading position in our primary markets  general engineering  transportation  aerospace and defense  energy and earthworks 
end users of our products include metalworking and machinery manufacturers and suppliers across a diverse array of industries  including the aerospace  defense  transportation  machine tool  light machinery and heavy machinery  as well as producers and suppliers in a number of equipment intensive industries such as coal mining  road construction and quarrying  as well as oil and gas exploration  refining  production and supply 
our end users applications range from airframes to mining operations  engines to oil wells and turbochargers to processing 
we believe that we are one of the largest global providers of consumable metalcutting tools and tooling supplies 
we entered fiscal after delivering record sales and profitability in our fiscal year end june  as a result of these tough comparisons to prior year and a slowing of the macro economic environment  our sales for decreased from the prior year 
in fiscal  we saw sales declines in both of our segments and all geographic regions 
for  sales were  million  a decrease of percent compared to prior year sales of  million 
operating income was million  a decrease of million compared to operating income of million in the decrease in operating income was driven by lower sales volume  lower absorption of manufacturing costs related to reduced sales volume and an inventory reduction initiative  as well as unfavorable currency exchange rates 
the decrease was partially offset by reduced operating expense 
raw material costs stabilized in the current year and did not have a significant impact on profitability of the business 
despite the depressed macro economic conditions  we were able to maintain a double digit operating margin of percent in fiscal the company had earnings per diluted share eps of in in fiscal  we continued the integration of deloro stellite holdings limited stellite  which was acquired in march we achieved a critical milestone in our integration plan in may as we implemented our enterprise resource planning erp system into four key stellite operating sites 
this implementation will allow us to accelerate future synergy opportunities  both commercial and operational 
similar to the served end markets of our infrastructure segment  stellite experienced demand weakness throughout the year 
we managed operating and integration costs to partially mitigate this adverse volume effect on operating results 
moving into fiscal  we remain focused on driving further synergies between kennametal and stellite 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million in the current year 
we have actively managed our business portfolio by returning over million to shareowners through share repurchases and dividends  repurchasing approximately million shares  and increasing our dividend by percent in july in addition  we made capital expenditures of million during the year 
we invested further in technology and innovation to continue delivering a high level of new products to our customers 
research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled million for in addition  we generated approximately percent of our sales from new products in fiscal year enhanced operating structure implemented as of july  at the start of fiscal  the company enhanced its organizational structure to align a broader base management team with customer facing products and technology platforms  as well as to further increase cross selling opportunities 
this operating structure supports the company stated growth objectives across diverse market sectors  preserves the focus on customers and increases product innovation 
the company will continue to report results in each of the industrial and infrastructure segments  as well as by served end markets  while also providing expanded disclosures discussing technology based sales for each segment 
consistent with previous allocation methodologies  corporate expenses related to each segment will be classified accordingly 
previously disclosed industrial and infrastructure segment results will be restated for certain sales reclassifications based on products and technologies and disclosed in future filings as appropriate 
results of continuing operations sales sales of  million in decreased percent from  million in as a result of an organic decline of percent  percent unfavorable effect from currency exchange and percent fewer business days in  partially offset by a percent increase from stellite 
organic sales decreased in both segments and across most regions 
drivers of the organic sales decline were general engineering of percent  energy markets of percent  earthworks of percent and transportation of percent  offset by an organic sales increase in aerospace and defense of percent 
sales of  million in increased percent from  million in as a result of strong organic growth of percent  business acquisition contribution of percent and percent more business days in organic sales increased in both segments and across most regions 
organic sales growth drivers were energy markets of percent  aerospace and defense of percent  earthworks of percent  general engineering of percent and transportation of percent 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to an organic sales decline of million and lower related absorption of manufacturing costs from both lower sales as well as the impact of our inventory reduction efforts  partially offset by the gross profit benefit of owning stellite for a full year and cost containment efforts 
the gross profit margin for was percent compared to percent in gross profit increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an organic sales increase of million  million related to the stellite acquisition and cost reduction benefits  partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable business segment mix 
the gross profit margin for decreased to percent from percent in due primarily to the stellite acquisition 
operating expense operating expense in was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to lower employment costs of million  mostly performance based compensation  favorable currency exchange rates of million  a decrease in stellite acquisition related costs of million and containment of discretionary spending  partially offset by additional operating expenditures of million related to a full year of stellite in our operations 
operating expense in was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to additional operating expenditures related to the stellite acquisition of million  acquisition related costs of million  and higher depreciation of million due to a full year of depreciation related to the erp system upgrade in  partially offset by a decrease in restructuring related charges of million and lower employment costs 
restructuring charges during and  there were no restructuring charges 
during  we completed our restructuring programs to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
these programs related to the rationalization of certain manufacturing and service facilities  as well as other employment and cost reduction programs 
we recognized million  which included million of restructuring charges of which million were related to inventory disposals and recorded as cost of goods sold 
restructuring related charges of million were recorded in cost of goods sold and million in operating expense during we realized pre tax benefits from these restructuring programs of approximately million during amortization of intangibles amortization expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of amortization expense in of million or percent was due to a full year of amortization of intangibles related to the stellite acquisition 
the increase of amortization expense in of million or percent was primarily due to the stellite acquisition 

table of contents interest expense interest expense increased million to million in  compared with million in due to increased borrowings to fund the stellite acquisition and the issuance of million of percent senior unsecured notes due in  partially offset by lower interest rates on our borrowings resulting from the favorable effect of refinancing our percent senior unsecured notes that matured last june with lower interest ten year senior unsecured notes maturing in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates was due to the decrease in the balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
interest expense increased million to million in  compared with million in due to increased borrowings to fund the stellite acquisition  primarily under our revolving credit facility  as well as the new million bond issuance in february which overlapped the maturity date of june for the old bond issuance 
the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
other expense income  net in  other expense  net was million compared to other income  net of million in the change was primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange rate losses of million and lower interest income of million 
in  other income  net was million compared to other expense  net of million in the change was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rate gains of million 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by a prior year valuation allowance release and higher relative earnings in the united states where the tax rates are higher than the rest of the world 
the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by the release of a valuation allowance in the netherlands and effective settlement of uncertain tax positions in the us  europe and asia 
the effect of these items was partially offset by increased income in the us where the tax rate is higher than the rest of the world and non deductible acquisition related costs 
during  we received an assessment from the italian tax authority that denied certain tax deductions primarily related to our tax return 
attempts at negotiating a reasonable settlement with the tax authority were unsuccessful  and as a result  we have decided to litigate the issue 
we believe the assessment is baseless  and accordingly  do not anticipate making a payment in connection with this assessment 
accordingly  no income tax liability has been recorded in connection with this assessment  however  settlement at its face value would result in an approximate million increase to income tax expense 
income attributable to kennametal shareowners income attributable to kennametal shareowners was million  or per diluted share  in  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the decrease in income from continuing operations was a result of the factors previously discussed 
income from continuing operations attributable to kennametal shareowners was million or per diluted share in  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the increase in income from continuing operations was a result of the factors previously discussed 
business segment review we operate two reportable operating segments consisting of industrial and infrastructure 
corporate expenses that are not allocated are reported in corporate 
segment determination is based upon internal organizational structure  the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance  the availability of separate financial results and materiality considerations 
industrial in thousands external sales operating income 
table of contents external sales of  million in decreased by million  or percent  from the decrease in sales was attributed to an organic sales decrease of percent  the impact of less business days of percent and unfavorable currency exchange rate effects of percent 
on an organic basis  sales decreased in all served market sectors except aerospace and defense where we had organic growth of percent 
organic sales declined in general engineering by percent and transportation by percent 
the aerospace and defense end markets sales growth is due to a significant increase in commercial aircraft production 
general engineering was unfavorably impacted by lower sales to the indirect channels due to further inventory destocking earlier in the year  and overall lower customer inventory levels throughout the year 
transportation experienced lower vehicle production rates in most geographic regions and extended plant shut downs  particularly in europe and asia 
on a regional basis  sales decreased by approximately percent in the americas  percent in europe and percent in asia due to strong comparisons to the prior year 
the sales decrease in the americas and asia was driven by general engineering  while europe was driven by both the general engineering and transportation end markets 
in  industrial operating income was million and decreased by million from the primary drivers of the decrease in operating income were lower organic sales of million and lower related absorption of manufacturing costs from both lower sales as well as the impact of our inventory reduction efforts  partially offset by operating expense discipline

on an organic basis  sales increased in all served market sectors led by strong growth in aerospace and defense  general engineering and transportation sales of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the aerospace and defense end markets sales growth is due to a significant increase in commercial aircraft production 
sales growth in the general engineering end markets is attributable to new orders for industrial machinery as manufacturers have increased their capital spending  as well as increased metalworking machinery production driven by a reaccelerating economy 
the transportation end markets sales growth was due to an overall increase in vehicle sales and production in the us while we still saw growth in european transportation sales  many european markets have begun to decline due to the recent economic environment in europe 
on a regional basis  sales increased by approximately percent in europe and percent in the americas and were relatively flat in asia due to strong comparisons to the prior year 
the sales increase in europe and the americas was driven by growth in the general engineering and transportation end markets

industrial operating margin increased to percent from percent in infrastructure in thousands external sales operating income external sales of  million in increased by million  or percent  from the increase in sales was attributed to acquisition growth of percent  offset by an organic sales decrease of percent  the impact of less business days of percent and by unfavorable currency exchange rate effects of percent 
the organic decrease was driven by lower sales in the energy and earthworks markets of percent and percent  respectively 
energy sales decreased due to delayed orders and lower drilling activity in oil and gas  primarily in north america 
earthwork sales declined from persistently weak underground coal mining activity globally  as well as a delayed start to the north america road construction season due to the colder weather in the spring 
on a regional basis  sales decreased by approximately percent in the americas  percent in europe and remained relatively flat in asia due to strong comparisons to the prior year 
the sales decrease in the americas was driven by the energy markets and to a slightly lesser extent the earthworks markets  while the sales decrease in europe was driven by the energy markets

table of contents external sales of  million in increased by million  or percent  from the increase in sales was attributed to organic sales increase of percent  acquisition growth of percent and the impact of more business days of percent 
the organic increase was driven by higher sales in the energy and earthworks markets of percent and percent  respectively 
sales in the earthworks end markets increased due to strong mining demand from asia in the first half of  increased road maintenance in parts of europe and asia  and price actions partially offset by softening mining and construction market conditions in north america 
energy related product sales grew due to increased shale production and increased natural gas production  partially offset by a decline in natural gas prices and reduced drilling activity 
on a regional basis  sales excluding acquisition increased by approximately percent in asia  percent in europe and percent in the americas 
the sales increase in asia was driven by performance in the earthworks markets  while the growth in europe and the americas was driven by earthworks markets and to a slightly lesser degree  the energy markets 
in  infrastructure operating income increased million from the primary drivers of the increase in operating income were higher organic sales of million  operating expense control and lower restructuring costs  partially offset by higher raw material costs 
operating income included million of acquisition related charges 
infrastructure operating margin decreased to percent from percent in due to the recent stellite business acquisition 
corporate in thousands corporate unallocated expense in  corporate unallocated expense decreased million  or percent from the decrease was driven by million of lower pension expense  partially offset by million of higher strategic project spending 
in  corporate unallocated expense decreased million  or percent from the decrease was driven by million of lower strategic project spending  partially offset by million of lower foreign government subsidy income for certain research projects and the impact of a non recurring reversal of an environmental liability in liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations and borrowings against our five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility credit agreement are the primary sources of funding for capital expenditures and internal growth 
during the year ended june   cash flow provided by operating activities was million  driven by our operating performance  and we had outstanding borrowings on our credit agreement of million 
on april   we took additional steps to further enhance our liquidity and capitalize upon market conditions and entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
the amendment extends the maturity date of the credit agreement to april the financial covenants and other key provisions remain unchanged

we sold percent of our shares and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we now own percent of the indian subsidiary 
on november   we issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due in interest is paid semi annually on may and november of each year 
we used the net proceeds from this notes offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on february   we issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due in interest is paid semi annually on february and august of each year 
we applied the net proceeds from this notes offering to the repayment of our percent senior unsecured notes on their june  maturity date 
on october   we entered into an amendment to our five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility  the credit agreement is used to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds 
the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling and japanese yen

additionally  we obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million of notes payable and million of term debt  capital leases and other debt 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  approximately percent and percent of our debt  respectively  was exposed to variable rates of interest 
the decrease in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates was due to the decrease in the balance outstanding on our credit agreement

environmental matters the operation of our business has exposed us to certain liabilities and compliance costs related to environmental matters 
we are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at certain of our locations 
superfund sites we are involved as a prp at various sites designated by the usepa as superfund sites 
for certain of these sites  we have evaluated the claims and potential liabilities and have determined that neither are material  individually or in the aggregate 
for certain other sites  proceedings are in the very early stages and have not yet progressed to a point where it is possible to estimate the ultimate cost of remediation  the timing and extent of remedial action that may be required by governmental authorities or the amount of our liability alone or in relation to that of any other prps 
other environmental issues we establish and maintain reserves for other potential environmental issues 
at june  and  the total of accruals for these reserves was million and million  respectively 
these reserves represent anticipated costs associated with the remediation of these issues 
the reserves we have established for environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the costs of addressing all identified environmental situations  based on our review of currently available evidence  and taking into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies  as well as public information released by the usepa  other governmental agencies  and by the prp groups in which we are participating 
although the reserves currently appear to be sufficient to cover these environmental liabilities  there are uncertainties associated with environmental liabilities  and we can give no assurance that our estimate of any environmental liability will not increase or decrease in the future 
the reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  the financial strength of other prps  the identification of new prps and the involvement of and direction taken by the government on these matters 
we maintain a corporate ehs department to monitor compliance with environmental regulations and to oversee remediation activities 
in addition  we have designated ehs coordinators who are responsible for each of our global manufacturing facilities 
our financial management team periodically meets with members of the corporate ehs department and the corporate legal department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects and contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we review financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies and adjust these reserves when appropriate 
effects of inflation despite modest inflation in recent years  rising costs  including the cost of certain raw materials  continue to affect our operations throughout the world 
we strive to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment  productivity improvements and price increases 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is freight on board shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or assembled machines to the common carrier 

table of contents our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship products or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned products and assembled machines and do not consider the effect of returned products and assembled machines to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all stock option awards 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
we perform our annual impairment tests during the june quarter in connection with our annual planning process  unless there are impairment indicators that warrant a test prior to that 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for certain employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on investment grade bond yield curves with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in our discount rates would increase our pre tax income by approximately million  and a hypothetical basis point decrease in our discount rates would decrease our pre tax income by approximately million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 

table of contents the rate of future health care cost increases is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until at june   a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in our health care cost trend rates would be immaterial to our pre tax income 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
we expect to contribute million and million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  in allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 
income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain  in part  due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  pension benefits  accrued employee benefits and inventory reserves 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required 
in the event we were to determine that we are able to use our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance had been recorded against the deferred tax assets  a decrease in the valuation allowance would be required 
new accounting standards adopted as of july   kennametal adopted changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
an entity could elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements 
each component of net income and other comprehensive income  together with totals for comprehensive income and its two parts  net income and other comprehensive income  need to be displayed under either alternative 
we elected to present the two statement option 
other than the change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
as of july   kennametal adopted changes to testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
issued in february  the fasb issued guidance on reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
however  the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in its disclosures 
this guidance is effective for kennametal beginning july  and is not expected to have a material impact to the financial statements other than additional disclosures 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued additional guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
this guidance is effective for kennametal beginning july   with early adoption permitted 
this guidance is not expected to have an impact on kennametal 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and  therefore  hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to provide predictability to the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow  allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other expense income  net 
see notes and of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency exchange rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  currency exchange rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and that would otherwise expose us to currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to currency exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates were million and million  respectively 
we would have received immaterial amounts at june  and to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these contracts 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would have changed accumulated other comprehensive loss income  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 

table of contents interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates  while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
we had no swaps in place as of june  we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts outstanding for forecasted transactions that effectively converted a cumulative notional amount of million from floating to fixed interest rates as of june  in february  we settled forward starting interest rate swap contracts to convert this million of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
upon settlement  we made a cash payment of million 
the loss is being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method 
we would have paid million at june  to settle these interest rate swap contracts  which represented the fair value of these contracts 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding debt  including capital leases and notes payable 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of termination settlement of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
on april   we took additional steps to further enhance our liquidity and capitalize upon market conditions and entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
the amendment extends the maturity of the credit agreement to april the financial covenants and other key provisions remain unchanged 
on november   we issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due in interest is paid semi annually on may and november of each year 
we used the net proceeds from this notes offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on february   we issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due in interest is paid semi annually on february and august of each year 
we settled forward starting interest rate swap contracts related to the bond issuance as further discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we applied the net proceeds from this notes offering to the repayment of our percent senior unsecured notes on their june  maturity date 
on october   we amended our revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes and extends the maturity to april we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of june  currency exchange rate fluctuations currency exchange rate fluctuations materially decreased diluted earnings per share by in  in and in currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on future earnings in the short term and long term
