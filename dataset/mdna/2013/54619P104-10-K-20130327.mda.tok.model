item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview louisiana bancorp  inc is a louisiana corporation that became the holding company for bank of new orleans in connection with the conversion of the bank in july from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank 
bank of new orleans is a community oriented savings bank headquartered in metairie  louisiana 
we currently operate four banking offices in jefferson  orleans and st 
tammany parishes 
our st 
tammany branch office was purchased from a regional commercial bank in january this purchase consisted of the property  improvements  and fixed assets  but did not include any deposits or loans 
the bank opened this office in the second quarter of our primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow to originate loans to our customers and invest in mortgage backed and other securities 
at december   we had total assets of million  including million in net loans and million of mortgage backed and other investment securities  total deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
historically  we have operated as a traditional thrift relying primarily on long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans to generate interest income 
during  and  our originations of single family residential mortgage loans totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our originations in the past three years have been reliant upon refinancing activity associated with low mortgage rates  and to a lesser extent  the continued repopulation of our market area following hurricane katrina 
in order to serve the financial needs of our business community  the bank offers mortgage products secured by multi family residential properties  commercial real estate and land 
in the aggregate  our originations of these types of loans were million  million  and million  respectively  for the periods ended december   and multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans generate higher levels of interest income than single family residential loans  but are subject to higher levels of risk 
as of december   we had ten loans with an aggregate principal balance of  that were to days delinquent  compared to eight loans with an aggregate principal balance of  at december  we anticipate that the current economic conditions may lead to additional job losses in our market area in the next twelve months  and will likely create additional delinquencies 
our non performing loans were million  million and  respectively  at december   and total real estate owned was   and million  respectively  at december   and at december   real estate owned was comprised of a restaurant in baton rouge  louisiana with a fair value of  and our participation interest in a million mixed use property development in baton rouge  louisiana having a fair value of  total non performing assets were million  million and million  respectively  at december   and our total mortgage backed securities and investment securities portfolio was million  or of our total assets at december  these securities are comprised of us agency issued obligations and do not include private label securities 
our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by conventional mortgage loans and do not include alt a  sub prime  or other non conforming collateral 
the market value of our securities may decline in the future due to an increase in the level of interest rates 
however  our securities are generally purchased as long term investments  therefore changes in market value during the holding period due to fluctuations in interest rates is expected 
we do not purchase securities for speculative or trading purposes 
our total deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management anticipates that the fdic s permanent increase in their maximum deposit insurance coverage to  and our efforts to grow corresponding deposits relationships with our new loan customers  will lead to future growth in our deposit base 
our total equity capital at december  was million 
our average equity to average assets ratio was for the year ended december  the bank s capital ratios exceed all regulatory guidelines  and the bank was deemed to be well capitalized as of december  our results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses  fee income and other non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion and other expense 
in addition  our salaries and benefits expense have increased in recent years due to the stock benefit plans that we implemented following the bank s conversion to the stock form 
for the years ended december   and  the cost of our employee stock ownership plan was   and  respectively 
compensation expense related to our stock option plan and recognition and retention plan were   and  during  and  respectively 
the initial grants under our stock option plan and recognition and retention plan  which constituted the substantial bulk of all grants made under such plans  became fully vested in february as a result  our expense related to these stock benefit plans will be substantially lower in than they were in our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial conditions and results of operations 
business strategy our business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community oriented financial institution 
below are certain highlights of our business strategy growing our loan portfolio 
we intend to grow our loan portfolio by increasing our originations of residential and commercial mortgage loans through referrals from our branch network and existing customers  increased use of media advertising  and recruiting highly qualified  experienced loan originators 
we may consider the purchase of additional participation interests in loans that meet our underwriting standards 
in addition to facilitating loan growth  such purchases may lessen the geographic concentration of our loans 
expanding our market area 
we intend to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional banking offices  including loan production offices 
in january of  the bank purchased a former branch office of a regional commercial bank in st 
tammany parish 
the acquisition price did not include customer deposits or loans 
the bank opened this facility in the second quarter of maintaining asset quality 
despite the negative effects of hurricane katrina  and more recently  the national recession  we remain committed to our prudent and conservative underwriting practices  and we intend to vigorously review our portfolio for potential problem assets in order to mitigate potential losses 
our ratio of non performing assets to total assets was at december  and at december continuing to provide exceptional customer service 
as a community oriented savings bank  we take pride in providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service to our customers that distinguishes us from the large regional banks operating in our market area 
our management team has strong ties to  and deep roots in  the community 
we believe that we know our customers banking needs and can respond quickly to address them 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other sections contained in this report 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for louisiana bancorp  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements 
these policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements  which are included in item of this annual report on form k 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of louisiana bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the financial statements require certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that represents the amount of probable and reasonably estimable known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans  and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  exposure at default  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios and general amounts for historical loss experience 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance 
historically  our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management s initial estimates 
in addition  the occ  as an integral part of its examination processes  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
we also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision to our initial estimates 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  recent cumulative losses and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
how we manage market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to market risk  our primary risk is credit risk on our loan portfolio 
we attempt to manage credit risk through our loan underwriting and oversight policies 
the principal objective of our interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
we seek to manage our exposure to risks from changes in interest rates while at the same time trying to improve our net interest spread 
we monitor interest rate risk as such risk relates to our operating strategies 
we have established an asset liability committee alco investment committee  which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller and two outside directors  and which is responsible for reviewing our asset liability and investment policies and interest rate risk position 
the alco investment committee meets on a regular basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on future earnings 
in recent years  we primarily have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have increased our originations of shorter term loans particularly multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans  we have attempted to match fund a portion of our loan portfolio with borrowings having similar expected lives  we generally sell long term year fixed rate mortgage loans which had been classified as held for sale  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits and borrowings  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally three to five years  and we hold significant amounts of liquid assets 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
our one year cumulative gap was a positive at december the following table sets forth the amounts of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we expect  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities of the bank at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
months or less more than months to months more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years total amount dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable investment securities mortgage backed securities other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities passbook accounts checking accounts money market accounts certificate accounts borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets at december  cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities at december  interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
economic value of equity and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in the economic value of its net portfolio equity eve and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
eve is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the eve ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we prepare these models in collaboration with a third party asset liability management consultant  and present them to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth the eve as of december   which reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated 
change in interest rates in basis points economic value of equity npv as of portfolio value of assets rate shock amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp static in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows the results of our nii model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands bp static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increases in interest rates  our net interest income for the months ending december  would be expected to decrease by  or  to million 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
average balances  net interest income  and yields earned and rates paid 
the following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
tax exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis 
all average balances are based on monthly balances 
management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be 
year ended december  average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable mortgage backed securities investment securities other interest earning assets total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities passbook  checking and money market accounts certificate accounts total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest earning assets net interest income  average interest rate spread net interest margin average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities includes nonaccrual loans during the respective periods 
calculated net of deferred fees and discounts and allowance for loan losses 
equals net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in rate  which is the change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and changes in volume  which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume

comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  for the year ended december   total interest income was million  a decrease of million compared to the year ended december  this decrease in interest income was due to a million decrease in the average balance of our interest earnings assets  and a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
in addition  at such date our available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to an aggregate of million 
we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at december   we had certificates of deposit maturing within the next months amounting to million 
based upon historical experience  we anticipate that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be redeposited with us 
for the year ended december   the average balance of our outstanding fhlb advances and other borrowings was million 
at december   we had million in outstanding fhlb advances and we had million in additional fhlb advances available to us 
in addition to cash flow from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of available for sale securities  we have significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs 
in recent years we have utilized borrowings as a cost efficient addition to deposits as a source of funds 
our borrowings consist primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank of dallas  of which we are a member 
under terms of the collateral agreement with the federal home loan bank  we pledge residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as our stock in the federal home loan bank as collateral for such advances 
we also access funds through reverse repurchase agreements with commercial banks 
these borrowings are typically used to fund purchases of mortgage backed securities at terms more favorable than those available through the federal home loan bank 
our borrowings from reverse repurchase agreements amounted to million at december  furthermore  we have the ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank discount window on an overnight or other short term basis 
borrowings from the federal reserve discount window are typically collateralized us government or agency issued investment or mortgage backed securities 
commitments the following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit  lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans at december  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed to one year more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years in thousands letters of credit lines of credit undisbursed portion of loans in process commitments to originate loans total commitments contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december  payments due by period total to one year more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years in thousands certificates of deposit fhlb advances and other borrowings total long term debt operating lease obligations total contractual obligations we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data of louisiana bancorp presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on its performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  derecognition of in substance real estate a scope clarification which relates to deconsolidation events 
under this amendment  when a parent reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of the default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt  the reporting entity should apply the guidance in subtopic  property  plant and equipment real estate sales  to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate 
this guidance is effective for the fiscal year ending december  and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  to provide enhanced disclosures in the financial statements about offsetting and netting arrangements 
the new guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement 
this guidance was issued to facilitate comparison between financial statements prepared on a us gaap and ifrs reporting 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which limits the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosures to the following financial instruments  to the extent they are offset in the financial statements or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether they are offset in the statement of financial position derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions 
asu no 
 which shares the same effective date as asu no 
 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  as the provisions of asu no 
and asu no 
only impact the disclosure requirements related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities  the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  relating to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications 
this guidance does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income and separately present reclassification adjustments and current period other comprehensive income 
the provisions of this guidance also requires that entities present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line item affected by the reclassification
