references to we  us  our and the company refer to excel trust  inc  any of our subsidiaries or to our predecessor  as applicable 
our predecessor is not a legal entity  but rather a combination of real estate entities and operations invested in four properties that were contributed to us in connection with our ipo 
overview we are a vertically integrated  self administered  self managed real estate firm with the principal objective of acquiring  financing  developing  leasing  owning and managing community and power centers  grocery anchored neighborhood centers and freestanding retail properties 
our strategy is to acquire high quality  well located  dominant retail properties that generate attractive risk adjusted returns 
we target competitively protected properties in communities that have stable demographics and have historically exhibited favorable trends  such as strong population and income growth 
we generally lease our properties to national and regional supermarket chains  big box retailers and select national retailers that frequently offer necessity and value oriented items and generate regular consumer traffic 
our tenants often carry goods that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader us economy and consumers disposable income  which we believe generates more predictable property level cash flows 
on april   we completed our ipo 
in connection with the ipo  we and our operating partnership  for which we are the sole general partner  engaged in certain formation transactions 
the formation transactions were designed to continue the operations of four properties that were contributed by related parties  enable us to raise the necessary capital to acquire increased interests in certain of the properties  provide capital for future acquisitions  fund certain development costs at our development property  establish a capital reserve for general corporate purposes and fund future joint venture capital commitments 
the exchange of entities or interests therein for shares of our common stock and operating partnership units has been accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control  and accordingly  the related assets and liabilities were reflected at their historical cost basis 
we were organized as a maryland corporation on december  and elected to be taxed as a reit beginning with our taxable year ended december  as of december   we owned an operating portfolio consisting of retail properties totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area including a consolidated joint venture  which were approximately leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately eight years  based on gross leasable area one retail property also contains apartment units on the upper levels of the shopping center  which were leased as of december  
we also owned two commercial office properties  excel center  a portion of which is utilized as our corporate headquarters  and the promenade corporate center 
these properties total  square feet of gross leasable area and were approximately leased as of december  in addition  we held ownership interests in two unconsolidated retail properties totaling  square feet of gross leasable area  which were approximately leased as of december  our non operating property consists of phase ii of our chimney rock property  which is held for future development 
phase i of our chimney rock property is classified as an operating property 

table of contents the following table reflects our total portfolio at december  a property is reclassified from development to the operating portfolio at the earlier of occupancy or one year from completion and delivery of the space gross leasable area gla occupied leased number of properties operating portfolio retail properties multi family properties units n a n a office properties total weighted average operating portfolio development property  n a unconsolidated properties total weighted average portfolio includes the apartment units on the upper levels of our west broad village retail shopping center the number of apartment units and leased percentage are not included in the total weighted average 
our non operating property consists of phase ii of our chimney rock property  which is held for future development 
phase i of our chimney rock property is classified as an operating property 
includes our la costa town center and the fountains at bay hill properties in which we hold and ownership interests  respectively 
our operations are carried on primarily through our operating partnership 
pursuant to contribution agreements  we and our operating partnership received a contribution of interests in four properties as well as the property management  leasing and real estate development operations of the properties in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock or operating partnership units and or the payment of cash to the contributors and the assumption of debt and other specified liabilities in connection with our ipo 
we receive income primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties 
potential impacts to our income include unanticipated tenant vacancies  vacancy of space that takes longer to re lease and  for non triple net leases  operating costs that cannot be recovered from our tenants through contractual reimbursement formulas in our leases 
our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required payments and overall real estate market conditions 
factors that may influence future results of operations rental revenue and tenant recoveries 
the amount of rental revenue and tenant recoveries generated by our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations 
as of december   our consolidated retail properties were approximately leased  our multi family property was approximately leased and our office properties were approximately leased 
the amount of rental revenue generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
positive or negative trends in our geographic areas or the retail market could adversely affect our rental revenue and tenant recoveries in future periods 
in addition  growth in rental income will partially depend on our ability to acquire additional retail properties that meet our investment criteria 
lease expirations 
our ability to re lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets as well as the desirability of our individual properties 
the leases scheduled to expire in the twelve months ending december  and december  represent and  respectively  of our total retail gross leasable area and and  respectively  of our annualized base rental revenue 

table of contents market conditions 
we seek investment opportunities throughout the united states  however  we focus on the northeast  northwest and sunbelt regions 
positive or negative changes in conditions in these markets will impact our overall performance 
future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our target markets or downturns in the retail industry that impair our ability to renew or re lease space as well as the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments  as such in the case of tenant bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
despite continued uncertainty in the national economy and the pace of the current economic recovery  we believe that our target markets are characterized by attractive demographics and property fundamental trends 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses generally consist of maintenance and repair expenses  real estate taxes  management fees and other operating expenses 
for select properties  our operating expenses are controlled  in part  by negotiating expense pass through provisions in tenant leases for most operating expenses 
most of the leases of our properties require tenants to pay all of their direct operating expenses as well as their pro rata share of substantially all of their indirect operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
tenants in the office building pay for their direct operating expenses as well as their pro rata share of indirect operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance to the extent those expenses increase above the initial year of their respective lease 
increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance 
general and administrative expenses 
we incur general and administrative expenses  including legal  accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance  public reporting  and compliance with various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase as we acquire additional assets and  as a result  our general and administrative expenses will increase 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  as described below 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income 
if expected useful lives of our investments in real estate were shortened  we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period  resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis 
management must make significant assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities acquired 
the use of different assumptions in the recording of the purchase cost of the acquired properties would affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired 
table of contents property which includes land  buildings  and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then recorded to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
the fair value of land is derived from comparable sales of land within the same submarket and or region 
the fair value of buildings and improvements  tenant improvements  site improvements  and leasing costs are based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information 
additionally  the purchase price of the applicable property is recorded to the above or below market value of in place leases  the value of in place leases and above or below market value of debt assumed 
the value recorded to the above or below market component of the acquired in place leases is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the value recorded to below market leases also includes the first renewal option if the renewal option is a fixed price and the fixed price is projected to be more than below estimated fair market rates at the time of exercise 
the amounts recorded to above market leases are included in lease intangible assets  net in our accompanying combined balance sheets and amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable lease term of the acquired leases with each property 
the amounts recorded to below market lease values are included in lease intangible liabilities  net in our accompanying combined balance sheets and amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable lease term plus any below market fixed price renewal options of the acquired leases with each property 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further recorded to in place lease costs and the value of tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics considered in recording these values include the nature and extent of the credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
the amounts recorded to in place lease costs are included in lease intangible assets  net in the accompanying combined balance sheets and will be amortized over the average remaining non cancelable lease term of the acquired leases with each property 
the amounts recorded to the value of tenant relationships are included in lease intangible assets  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the average remaining non cancelable lease term of the acquired leases plus a market lease term 
the value recorded to above or below market debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between the cash flow stream of the assumed mortgage and the cash flow stream of a market rate mortgage 
the amounts recorded to above or below market debt are included in mortgage loan payables  net on our accompanying combined balance sheets and are amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the assumed mortgage 
costs incurred in connection with the development or construction of properties and improvements are capitalized 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes and other direct costs incurred during the period of development 
we capitalize costs on land and buildings under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy 
the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction 

table of contents maintenance and repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
maintenance and repairs costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacements and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of a long lived asset by considering expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenants ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows  excluding interest expense  expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
the amount of impairment loss  if any  is determined by comparing the fair value  as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis  with the carrying value of the related assets 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
although our strategy is to hold our properties over a long term period  if the strategy changes or market conditions dictate that the sale of properties at an earlier date would be preferable  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
revenue recognition we commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors 
in most cases  revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
generally  this occurs on the lease commencement date 
in determining what constitutes the leased asset  we evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements 
if we are the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements  then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space  typically when the improvements are substantially complete 
if we conclude that we are not the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements the lessee is the owner  then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives  which reduce revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining non cancelable term of the respective lease 
in these circumstances  we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct improvements 
the determination of who is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins 
we consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes 
these factors include whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements  the uniqueness of the improvements  the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease  the responsible party for construction cost overruns  and who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements 
the determination of who owns the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination we consider all of the above factors 
however  no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the 
table of contents underlying leases is included in deferred rent receivable on the accompanying combined balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination were determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of the related unamortized above or below market lease intangible would be accelerated and such amounts in addition to any deferred rent receivable would be written off 
substantially all of our retail rental operations expenses  consisting of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs are recoverable from tenants under the terms of our lease agreements 
amounts recovered are dependent on several factors  including occupancy and lease terms 
revenues are recognized in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recognized in revenues as tenant recoveries  and the expenses are recorded in rental operations expenses  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and bear the credit risk 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled  the amounts to be received are fixed and determinable and collectability is assured  and we have no continuing obligation to provide space to former tenants 
percentage rent is income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent and tenant recovery payments or defaults 
we may also maintain an allowance for accrued straight line rents and amounts due from lease terminations based on our assessment of the collectability of the balance 
results of operations we operate through three reportable business segments retail properties  multi family properties and office properties 
at december   we owned consolidated retail operating properties with a total of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area 
the multi family segment consists of apartment units at one retail property  west broad village  which is located in richmond  virginia 
the office segment consists of two properties  excel centre  a portion of which is utilized as our headquarters  and the promenade corporate center 
these properties total  square feet of gross leasable area 
all of our other properties are reported in the retail segment

table of contents proportionate share of the outstanding indebtedness at our unconsolidated the fountains at bay hill property 
we utilized borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility and proceeds from our series b preferred stock offering and our october common stock offering to acquire these properties

general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher acquisition costs related to completed and pending acquisitions  an increase in other professional and audit fees and an overall increase in compensation costs including benefits and payroll taxes related to an increase in total employees 
this was partially offset by the decrease in share based compensation expense as a result of the graded vesting method of recognizing compensation expense related to the performance based stock awards  which resulted in a declining amount of compensation expense in as compared to depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to our acquisition of operating properties in and including the la costa town center property that was contributed to an unconsolidated entity in september and the commencement of depreciation at our development property in interest expense  net interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was

both of these ownership interests are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an investment in unconsolidated entities see note of the consolidated and combined financial statements contained elsewhere herein for further discussion 
the loss of  recognized for the year ended december  is primarily comprised of our proportionate share of non recurring costs associated with the acquisition of the la costa town center property by the joint venture and our acquisition of an ownership interest in the fountains at bay hill property and the amortization of loan costs associated with incurred indebtedness in excess of our proportionate share of the operating income of the properties 
changes in fair value of financial instruments and gain on redemption of op units a gain on changes in fair value of financial instruments and gain on redemption of op units of approximately million was recognized in the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in the estimated fair value of the redemption provision of op units arising from a property acquired in and the redemption of  op units

funds from operations we present funds from operations  or ffo  because we consider ffo an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit 
as defined by nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and net gains losses on the disposition of real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
our computation may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions

distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code 
to continue to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including the requirement that we distribute currently at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders

inflation some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we may be adversely impacted by inflation on our leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions 
in addition  most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance 
this may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation  assuming our properties remain leased and tenants fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for such expenses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk 
many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk 
the fair value of mortgages payable at december   including our construction loan  was approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million

the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks  including counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
to limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities 
we do not enter into such contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents as of december   we had two interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk 
both derivatives were interest rate swaps and the notional amount totaled million 
the interest rate swap contracts fixed libor at an average of for the term of a mortgage loan which expires in december the fair value of these derivative financial instruments was approximately  at december  and is classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
