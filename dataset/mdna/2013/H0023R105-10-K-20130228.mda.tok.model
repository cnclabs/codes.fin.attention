table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  under item of this form k 
all comparisons in this discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise indicated 
effective january   we retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
under the new guidance  the definition of acquisition costs was modified to specify that a cost must be directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract in order to be deferred 
prior year amounts and ratios contained in this report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of retrospective adjustments as a result of applying this new accounting guidance 
in addition  effective january   we reclassified prior years segment operating results in order to conform to certain organizational realignments 
these realignments resulted in a transfer of operating revenue and underwriting results of our international direct marketed and credit life businesses from the insurance overseas general segment to the life segment 
these realignments have no impact on consolidated operating results  however  prior years segment operating results and ratios contained in this report have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation

global reinsurance provides solutions for customers ranging from small commercial insureds to multinational ceding companies 
global reinsurance offers products such as property and workers compensation catastrophe  d o  professional liability  specialty casualty and specialty property 
the life segment includes our international life operations ace life  ace tempest life re ace life re  and the north american supplemental a h and life business of combined insurance 
ace life expanded its business through the february  acquisition of new york life korea operations and the april  acquisition of new york life hong kong operations 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of these acquired businesses from the acquisition dates 
for additional information on each of our segments refer to segment information under item our product and geographic diversification differentiates us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility 
our long term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income 
by doing so  we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities 
profit centers can access various legal entities  subject to licensing and other regulatory rules 
profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk adjusted returns 
this corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center senior management team the necessary 
table of contents autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base 
we are an underwriting organization and senior management is focused on delivering underwriting profit 
we strive to achieve underwriting income by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept 
our insurance and reinsurance operations generate gross revenues from two principal sources premiums and investment income 
cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses  policy acquisition costs  and administrative expenses 
invested assets are substantially held in liquid  investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration 
claims payments in any short term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements 
the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates  stock market volatility  and credit events such as corporate defaults 
the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends  inflation rates  court awards  and catastrophes 
we believe that our cash balance  our highly liquid investments  credit facilities  and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for additional information during  we announced that we reached definitive agreements to acquire fianzas monterrey  a leading surety lines company in mexico  as well as aba seguros  a p c insurer in mexico that provides automobile  homeowners  and small business coverages 
these transactions  which are subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions  are expected to be completed in the first half of refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial highlights for the year ended december  net income increased percent to billion 
total company net premiums written increased percent and percent on a constant dollar basis 
p c combined ratio was percent compared with percent in p c expense ratio was percent compared with percent in the current accident year p c combined ratio was percent compared with percent in favorable prior period development was million  representing percentage points of the combined ratio 
this compares to favorable prior period development of million in  representing percentage points of the combined ratio 
total pre tax and after tax catastrophe losses including reinstatement premiums were million and million  respectively  which included superstorm sandy losses of million and million  respectively 
this compares to pre tax and after tax catastrophe losses including reinstatement premiums of million and million  respectively  in operating cash flow was billion compared with billion in net investment income decreased percent to billion 
net realized losses from derivative accounting related to variable annuity reinsurance were million compared to million in our underwriting performance reflects numerous factors  including an improved price environment in the us  global business growth in asia  latin america  and europe  balanced product spread among commercial p c  specialty p c  a h  personal lines  and life  and a continuing focus on underwriting and marketing discipline through the use of data analytics and portfolio management that complements a strong underwriting culture 
our commercial and specialty p c business grew in the us  asia  and latin america and  more modestly  in europe 
our a h insurance business grew globally in constant dollars and we expect that growth to increase throughout we also expect our commercial p c business in the us to continue to benefit from an improving price environment 
in addition  we believe certain casualty lines will benefit from price increases in while property pricing will likely flatten as the year progresses 
during the year  we committed or deployed capital to acquisitions in regions of the world that are expected to enhance our growth and diversification strategies 
these acquisitions  
table of contents along with a strong us pricing environment  strong retention rates  and new business activities are expected to result in profitable growth in critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that  either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  are determined using best estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment  actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented 
we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are unpaid loss and loss expense reserves  including long tail asbestos and environmental a e reserves  future policy benefits reserves  the valuation of value of business acquired voba and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba  the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts  reinsurance recoverable  including a provision for uncollectible reinsurance  the valuation of our investment portfolio and assessment of other than temporary impairments otti  the valuation of deferred tax assets  the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed living benefits glb  and the valuation of goodwill 
we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled prior period development  asbestos and environmental a e and other run off liabilities  reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance  investments  net realized and unrealized gains losses  and other income and expense items 
unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company  we are required by applicable laws and regulations and gaap to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers 
the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date case reserves and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date 
ibnr may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves 
loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims loss expenses 
at december   our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were billion 
with the exception of certain structured settlements  for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable  and certain reserves for unsettled claims that are discounted in statutory filings  our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money 
in connection with such structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims  we carried net discounted reserves of million at december  and million at december  
table of contents the table below presents a roll forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses december  december  in millions of us dollars gross losses reinsurance recoverable net losses gross losses reinsurance recoverable net losses balance  beginning of year losses and loss expenses incurred losses and loss expenses paid other including foreign exchange translation losses and loss expenses acquired balance  end of year net of provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances known at the date of accrual 
the following table presents our total reserves segregated between case reserves includes loss expense reserves and ibnr reserves december  december  in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net case reserves ibnr reserves total 
table of contents the following table segregates loss reserves by three broad line of business groupings property and all other  casualty  and a h or personal accident 
in the table  loss expenses are defined to include unallocated and allocated loss adjustment expenses 
december  december  in millions of us dollars gross ceded net gross ceded net property and all other case reserves loss expenses ibnr reserves subtotal casualty case reserves loss expenses ibnr reserves subtotal a h case reserves loss expenses ibnr reserves subtotal total case reserves loss expenses ibnr reserves total the judgments used to estimate unpaid loss and loss expense reserves require different considerations depending upon the individual circumstances underlying the insured loss 
for example  the reserves established for high excess casualty claims  a e claims  claims from major catastrophic events  or the ibnr for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made 
necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methods are developed  or as laws change 
hence  ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date 
changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results  adversely if our estimates increase and favorably if our estimates decrease 
the potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors  which we discuss below 
we establish loss and loss expense reserves for our claims liabilities for all insurance and reinsurance business that we write 
for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date  and where we have sufficient information  our claims personnel establish case reserves as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim s  standard claim handling practices  and professional judgment 
furthermore  for our assumed reinsurance operation  global reinsurance  an additional case reserve may be established above the amount notified by the ceding company if the notified case reserve is judged to be insufficient by global reinsurance claims department refer to assumed reinsurance below 
in respect of those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date  there is  by definition  limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to project the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr 
we have actuarial staff within each of our business units who analyze loss reserves and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the corresponding indications of the required ibnr reserve 
note that losses include loss expenses for the purposes of this discussion 
ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims 
the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on 
table of contents the extrapolation of actual historical data  loss development patterns  and industry data as appropriate 
the estimate of the required ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors  both qualitative and quantitative 
among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume  changes in ceded reinsurance structures  changes in claims handling practices  reported and projected loss trends  inflation  the legal environment  and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties 
typically  for each product line  one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses  and from these estimates  a single actuarial central estimate is selected 
exceptions to the use of standard actuarial projection methods occur for individual claims of significance that require complex legal  claims  and actuarial analysis and judgment for example  a e account projections or high excess casualty professional lines accounts in litigation or for product lines where the nature of the claims experience and or availability of the data prevent application of such standard methods 
in addition  claims arising from certain catastrophic events require evaluations that do not utilize standard actuarial loss projection methods but are based upon our exposure at the time of the event and the circumstances of the catastrophe and its post event impact 
standard actuarial reserving methods the standard actuarial reserving methods may include  but are not limited to  expected loss ratio  paid and reported loss development  and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
a general description of these methods is provided below 
in the subsequent discussion on short and long tail business  reference is also made  where appropriate  to how consideration in method selection impacted results 
in addition to these standard methods  we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches depending upon the product line characteristics and available data 
to ensure that the projections of future loss emergence based on historical loss development patterns are representative of the underlying business  the historical loss and premium data is required to be of sufficient homogeneity and credibility 
for example  to improve data homogeneity  we may subdivide product line data further by similar risk attribute eg  geography  coverage such as property versus liability exposure  or elements of program structure such as attachments or limits  project ultimate losses for these homogeneous groups and then combine the results to provide the overall product line estimate 
the premium and loss data are aggregated by origin year eg  the year in which the losses were incurred accident year or report year  for example and annual or quarterly development periods 
implicit in the standard actuarial methods that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions first  the pattern by which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year and second  the expected loss ratio for each origin year 
the expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected after consideration of a number of factors  including historical loss ratios adjusted for intervening rate changes  premium and loss trends  industry benchmarks  the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting  and other more subjective considerations for the product line and external environment as noted above 
the expected loss ratio for a given origin year is initially established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process 
this analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management 
the expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by multiplying the expected ultimate loss ratio by the corresponding premium base 
this method is most commonly used as the basis for the actuarial central estimate for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet deemed sufficiently credible to serve as the principal basis for the selection of ultimate losses 
the expected loss ratio for a given origin year may be modified over time if the underlying assumptions such as the assessment of prior year loss ratios  loss trend  or premium rate changes differ from the original assumptions 
our selected paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored 
where possible  development patterns are selected based on historical loss emergence by origin year with appropriate allowance for changes in business mix  claims handling process  or ceded reinsurance that are likely to lead to a discernible difference between the rate of historical and future loss emergence 
for product lines where the historical data is viewed to have low statistical credibility  the selected development patterns also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere within ace 
this most commonly occurs for relatively new product lines that have limited historical data or for high severity low frequency portfolios where our historical experience exhibits considerable volatility and or lacks credibility 
the paid and reported loss development methods convert the selected loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period 
due to their multiplicative nature  the paid and reported loss development methods will leverage differences between actual and expected loss emergence 
these methods tend to be utilized for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is essentially a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method  where the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures 
this approach allows a logical 
table of contents transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss development methods which are typically utilized at later maturities 
we usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may be used 
the applicability of actuarial methods will also be impacted by the attachment point of the policy or contract with the insured or ceding company 
in the case of low attachment points typical of primary insurance or working layer reinsurance  the experience tends to be more frequency driven 
for these product types  standard actuarial methods generally work well in determining loss reserve levels  as the loss experience is often credible  given a sufficient history and volume of claims experience 
in the case of high attachment points typical of excess insurance or excess of loss reinsurance  the experience tends to be severity driven  as only a loss of significant size will enter the layer 
for these product lines  it typically takes longer for loss experience to gain credibility  which adds uncertainty to the estimates derived from standard actuarial methods 
for products such as our assumed reinsurance business  we typically supplement the standard actuarial methods with an analysis of each contract terms  original pricing information  subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts  market exposures and history  and qualitative input from claims managers 
this approach is also used for structured or unique contracts 
determining management best estimate our recorded reserves represent management best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date 
we perform an actuarial reserve review for each product line at least once a year 
at the conclusion of each review  we establish an actuarial central estimate 
the process to select the actuarial central estimate  when more than one estimate is available  may differ across product lines 
for example  an actuary may base the central estimate on loss projections developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach when reported losses are viewed to be a more credible indication of the ultimate loss compared with paid losses 
the availability of estimates for different projection techniques will depend upon the product line  the underwriting circumstances  and the maturity of the loss emergence 
for a well established product line with sufficient volume and history  the actuarial central estimate may be drawn from a weighting of paid and reported loss development and or bornhuetter ferguson methods 
however  for a new long tail product line for which we have limited data and experience or a rapidly growing line  the emerging loss experience may not have sufficient credibility to allow selection of loss development or bornhuetter ferguson methods and reliance may be placed upon the expected loss ratio method until the experience matures and becomes credible 
management best estimate is developed from the actuarial central estimate after collaboration with actuarial  underwriting  claims  legal  and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees 
each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial  finance  claims  and unit senior management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the estimate to be used as management best estimate 
reserves are further reviewed by ace chief actuary and senior management 
the objective of such a process is to determine a single estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other 
such an estimate is viewed by management to be the best estimate of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on consideration of a number of factors in addition to the actuarial central estimate  including but not limited to segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods  extent of internal historical loss data  and industry information where required  historical variability of actual loss emergence compared with expected loss emergence  perceived credibility of emerged loss experience  rate monitor information for new and renewal business  impact of applicable reinsurance recoveries  and nature and extent of underlying assumptions 
management does not build in any specific provision for uncertainty 
we do not calculate ranges of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies 
such ranges are generally not a true reflection of the potential difference between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement value of losses 
this is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual prior period development reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements relates in part to events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date 
while we believe that our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent management best estimate for each product line as of the current valuation date  future changes to our view of 
table of contents the ultimate liabilities are possible 
a five percent change in our net loss reserves equates to billion and represents five percent of shareholders equity at december  historically  including a e reserve charges  our reserves  at times  have developed in excess of percent of recorded amounts 
refer to analysis of losses and loss expenses development  under item  for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements 
we perform internal loss reserve studies for all product lines at least once a year according to a schedule that is established at the start of the calendar year 
in addition  each quarter for most product lines  we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations 
if warranted from findings in loss emergence tests  we may alter the timing of our product line reserve studies 
finally  loss reserve studies are performed annually by external third parties and the findings are used to test the reasonableness of our internal findings 
the time period between the date of loss occurrence and the final payment date of the ensuing claim s is referred to as the claim tail 
the following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations for both short tail and long tail product lines 
in this section  we reference the nature of recent prior period development to give a high level understanding of how these considerations translate through the reserving process into financial decisions 
refer to the prior period development section below for additional information on prior period development 
short tail and long tail business short tail business short tail business generally describes product lines for which losses are typically known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs 
this would include  for example  most property  personal accident  aviation hull  and automobile physical damage policies that we write 
there are some exceptions on certain product lines or events eg  major hurricanes or earthquakes where the event has occurred  but the final settlement amount is highly uncertain and not known with certainty for a potentially lengthy period 
due to the short reporting and development pattern for these product lines  the uncertainty associated with our estimate of ultimate losses for any particular accident period diminishes relatively quickly as actual loss experience emerges 
we typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence  such as the paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  sooner than would be the case for long tail lines at a similar stage of development for a given origin year 
the reserving process for short tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves an assessment by the claims department  in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries  of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event and then subsequent revisions of the estimated losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information 
for the origin year  the short tail line loss reserves were typically established for the non catastrophe exposures using a combination of the expected loss ratio method and methods that incorporate actual loss emergence 
as the year progressed  we also adjusted these reserves for large non catastrophe loss activity that we considered to be greater or less than the historical averages 
reserves were also established for losses that arose on catastrophe activity during using the approach described above 
the underlying calculation for the non catastrophe losses requires initial expected loss ratios by product line adjusted for actual experience during the calendar year 
as previously noted  the derivation of initial loss ratios incorporates actuarial projections of prior years losses  past and expected future loss and exposure trends  rate adequacy for new and renewal business  and ceded reinsurance coverage and costs 
we also considered our view of the impact of terms and conditions and the market environment  which by their nature tend to be more subjective relative to other factors 
since there is some degree of random volatility of non catastrophe loss experience from year to year  we considered average loss experience over several years when developing loss estimates for the current accident year 
for our short tail businesses taken as a whole  overall loss trend assumptions did not differ significantly relative to prior years 
in terms of prior accident years  the bulk of the changes made in the calendar year arose from origin years through specifically  the insurance north american  insurance overseas general  and global reinsurance segments experienced million  million  and million of favorable prior period development  respectively  primarily due to lower than anticipated loss emergence rather than any significant changes to underlying actuarial assumptions such as loss development patterns 
in the insurance north american and insurance overseas general segments  these prior period movements were primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for origin years through in the global reinsurance segment  the prior period movements were primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for origin years through for further analysis of changes in assumptions related to short tail prior accident year reserves during calendar year  refer to the prior period development section below 

table of contents long tail business long tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known reported for some period and for which claims can take significant time to settle close 
this includes most casualty lines such as general liability  d o  and workers compensation 
there are various factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long tail business 
among these are our historical loss data and experience is sometimes too immature and lacking in credibility to rely upon for reserving purposes 
where this is the case  in our reserve analysis we may utilize industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that we believe reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development  where available 
for such product lines  actual loss experience may differ from industry loss statistics as well as loss experience for previous underwriting years  the inherent uncertainty around loss trends  claims inflation eg  medical and judicial and underlying economic conditions  the inherent uncertainty of the estimated duration of the paid and reported loss development patterns beyond the historical record requires that professional judgment be used in the determination of the length of the patterns based on the historical data and other information  the inherent uncertainty of assuming that historical paid and reported loss development patterns for older origin years will be representative of subsequent loss emergence on recent origin years 
for example  changes over time in the processes and procedures for establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can alter the development of paid and reported losses  loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner 
if data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics  such as loss payment patterns  the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected 
additionally  since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured  there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses  and the applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years 
as can be seen from the above  various factors are considered when determining appropriate data  assumptions  and methods used to establish the loss reserve estimates for long tail product lines 
these factors may also vary by origin year for given product lines 
the derivation of loss development patterns from data and the selection of a tail factor to project ultimate losses from actual loss emergence require considerable judgment  particularly with respect to the extent to which historical loss experience is relied upon to support changes in key reserving assumptions 
examples of the relationship between changes in historical loss experience and key reserving assumptions are provided below 
for those long tail product lines that are less claim frequency and more claim severity oriented  such as professional lines and high excess casualty  we placed more reliance upon expert legal and claims review of the specific circumstances underlying reported cases rather than loss development patterns 
where appropriate  we then supplemented this with loss development and bornhuetter ferguson approaches to provide for claims that have been reported but are too immature to develop individual claims estimates and also to provide for pure ibnr 
the assumptions used for these lines of business are updated over time to reflect new claim and legal advice judged to be of significance 
for the origin year  loss reserves were typically established through the application of individual product line expected loss ratios that contemplated assumptions similar in nature to those noted in the short tail line discussion 
our assumptions on loss trend and development patterns reflect reliance on our historical loss data provided the length and volume of history and homogeneity afford credibility 
for those portfolios where we feel that our data lacks credibility  our assumptions may judgmentally utilize industry loss trends and development patterns 
we note that industry patterns are not always available to match the nature of the business being written  this issue is particularly problematic for non us exposed lines 
given the underlying volatility of the long tail product lines and the lengthy period required for full paid and reported loss emergence  we typically assign little to no credibility to actual loss emergence in the early development periods 
accordingly  we generally used the expected loss ratio method for the and immediately preceding origin years to establish reserves by product line 
we monitor actual paid and reported loss emergence relative to expected loss emergence for most individual product lines 
the process to develop origin year reserves for our long tail casualty business relies heavily on prior origin year estimates of ultimate and historical loss ratios adjusted to current rate and loss trend levels 
when estimating the ultimate loss levels for these prior origin years for the major long tail lines in insurance north american  insurance overseas general  and global 
table of contents reinsurance no changes of significance were made to the loss development patterns  however  we have revised historical loss and exposure trend assumptions to reflect emerged frequency and severity trends observed in both our internal data and available industry data 
in general  this has resulted in lower historical loss trend assumptions 
while we have not assumed that these reduced loss trends continued in  we have reflected this information in the process to derive expected loss ratio assumptions from historical data adjusted to origin year levels 
for long tail portfolios where actual loss emergence in calendar year was lower than expected for the more recent origin years  the deviation was not typically seen as sufficiently credible  particularly given the volatility and lengthy period for full loss emergence  to fully reflect in our booked ultimate loss selections or the actuarial assumptions underlying the reserve reviews 
however  for certain product lines with early loss emergence on more recent origin years that was greater than expected  we did respond since we believe that such adverse emergence is generally significant relative to the loss emergence pattern assumptions eg  origin years through for casualty and financial lines in insurance overseas general 
such judgments were made with due consideration to the factors impacting reserve uncertainty as discussed above 
the reserve actions that we took in are discussed further below and in the section entitled prior period development 
for more mature origin years  typically and prior  we gave meaningful weight to indicated ultimates derived from methods that rely on the paid and reported loss development patterns based on historical experience where sufficient credibility existed 
this is consistent with our historical approach of allowing favorable loss emergence sufficient time to be reliably established before assigning it full credibility 
for those lines where the historical experience lacked credibility  we placed reliance upon the latest benchmark patterns where available from external industry bodies such as insurance services office iso or the national council on compensation insurance  inc ncci 
in such cases  the assumptions used to project ultimate loss estimates will not fully reflect our own actual loss experience until our data is deemed sufficiently credible 
the prior period development in for long tail lines of business comprised several main components 
first  we experienced favorable prior period development on a number of product lines where actual loss emergence was lower than expected and or increased weighting was given to experience based methods as relevant origin years mature typically and prior 
in particular  this included umbrella and excess casualty business  d o  and medical risk operations product lines in insurance north american principally in origin years and million favorable  casualty and financial lines in insurance overseas general for origin years and prior million favorable  and origin years and prior for long tail product lines in global reinsurance million favorable 
second  we experienced adverse development on and subsequent years in casualty and financial lines in insurance overseas general million principally arising from specific circumstances on certain larger claims and on and subsequent years in non medical professional liability in global reinsurance million principally due to higher than expected loss emergence 
third  we experienced adverse development from insurance north american inactive product lines including westchester and brandywine run off operations million 
the causes for the westchester and brandywine operations are described further below 
for further analysis of changes in assumptions related to long tail prior accident year reserves during calendar year  refer to the prior period development section below 
sensitivity to underlying assumptions while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december   is adequate  new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve  which could have a material effect on future operating results 
as noted previously  our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from any number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process 
therefore  it is difficult to convey  in a simple and quantitative manner  the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate 
in the examples below  we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described 
we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption 
insurance north american given the long reporting and paid development patterns for workers compensation business  the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for the company current exposure requires considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves 
specifically  adjusting ground up ultimate losses by a one percent change in the tail factor ie  changed to either or would cause a change of approximately million  either positive or negative  for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves 
this represents an impact of percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 

table of contents the reserve portfolio for our ace bermuda operations contains exposure to predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence first reported basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and gross limits of up to million and d o and other professional liability coverage on a claims made basis typically with attachment points in excess of million and gross limits of up to million 
due to the layer of exposure covered  the expected frequency for this book is very low 
as a result of the low frequency high severity nature of the book  a small difference in the actual vs 
expected claim frequency  either positive or negative  could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where close to maximum limits were deployed 
insurance overseas general certain long tail lines  such as casualty and professional lines  are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation 
heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates 
our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment  it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments 
for example  when applying the reported loss development method  the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines for accident years and prior by approximately million 
this represents an impact of percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
global reinsurance typically  there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns  especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers compensation or general liability  which may take up to years to fully develop 
this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low credibility of the data 
the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses 
for example  a percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for us long tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately million 
this represents an impact of percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately billion 
assumed reinsurance at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
in comparison  at december   net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to billion  consisting of million of case reserves and billion of ibnr 
for catastrophe business  we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information  including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants  ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers  and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves 
for our casualty reinsurance business  we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses 
due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies  as well as other factors  the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business 
these include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following the reported claims information could be inaccurate  typically  a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim 
the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag 
because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers  ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers  who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty 
the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations 
therefore  the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines  and the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available 
further  for certain coverages or products  such as excess of loss 
table of contents contracts  there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability 
in such cases  the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources 
we mitigate the above risks in several ways 
in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable  we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate  complete  and timely 
as appropriate  audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process 
we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses 
on occasion  there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies 
this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves 
for ibnr  we use historical experience and other statistical information  depending on the type of business  to estimate the ultimate loss 
we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty coverage basis ie  risks attaching or losses occurring 
at december   the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were million  compared with the million we recorded 
our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant 
within the insurance north american segment  we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run off since unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division of our insurance north american segment 
most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run off reinsurance business relate to a e claims 
refer to the asbestos and environmental a e and other run off liabilities section for additional information 
asbestos and environmental reserves included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a e a e liabilities 
the a e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites 
the estimation of our a e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal  social  and economic environment 
we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a e liabilities  which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims 
during  we conducted our annual internal  ground up review of our consolidated a e liabilities as of december  as a result of the internal review  we increased our gross loss reserves for the brandywine operations  including a e  by million  while the net loss reserves increased by million 
in addition  we increased gross loss reserves for westchester specialty a e and other liabilities by million  and net loss reserves increased by million 
our a e liabilities are not discounted for gaap reporting and do not reflect any anticipated future changes in the legal  social or economic environment  or any benefit from future legislative reforms 
there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome 
we believe the most significant variables relating to our a e liabilities include the current legal environment  specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims  assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims  assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants including bankruptcy trusts and other insurers  the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage  whether high level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder claim trends and liability situation  payments to unimpaired claimants  and  the potential liability of peripheral defendants 
based on the policies  the facts  the law  and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account  we estimate the potential liability for indemnity  policyholder defense costs  and coverage litigation expense 
the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers  policyholders  and claimants 
for additional information refer to the asbestos and environmental a e and other run off liabilities section and to note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our insurance overseas general and life segments that are classified as long duration 
these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products  term and whole life products  endowment products  and annuities 
in accordance with gaap  we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses  mortality  morbidity  persistency  and investment yields with a factor for adverse deviation 
these assumptions are locked in at the inception of the contract  meaning we use our original assumptions throughout the life of the policy and do not subsequently modify them unless we deem the reserves to be inadequate 
the future policy benefits reserves balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency 
if experience is less favorable than assumptions  additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
valuation of value of business acquired voba and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long duration contracts  such as life products  we established an intangible asset related to voba  which represented the fair value of the future profits of the in force contracts 
the valuation of voba at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves 
the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows 
we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long duration contracts and voba collectively policy acquisition costs over the estimated life of the contracts  generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
for non traditional long duration contracts  we amortize policy acquisition costs over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimates of expected gross profits 
the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions 
policy acquisition costs  which consist of commissions  premium taxes  and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract  are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income  including investment income 
unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified 
risk transfer in the ordinary course of business  we both purchase or cede and sell or assume reinsurance protection 
we discontinued the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts  as a matter of policy  in for both ceded and assumed reinsurance  risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting  principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses 
if risk transfer requirements are not met  a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit  typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense 
to meet risk transfer requirements  a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk  consisting of underwriting and timing risk  and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity 
we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit 
contracts that include fixed premium ie  premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment 
reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions  such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience  and relatively low policy limits  as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits  can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met 
for such contracts  often referred to as finite or structured products  we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception 
to support risk transfer  the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible  such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds percent 
for purposes of cash flow analyses  we generally use a risk free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments 
in addition  to support insurance risk  we must prove the reinsurer risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss 
to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed  qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products 
we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting 
if any criterion is triggered  a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight  including peer review  from our global structured transaction review committee 
with respect to ceded reinsurance  we entered into a few multi year excess of loss retrospectively rated contracts  principally in these contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions 
because traditional one year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly  these contracts were generally entered in order to secure a more cost 
table of contents effective reinsurance program 
all of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance 
in addition  we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to  such as the national indemnity company nico contracts referred to in the section entitled  asbestos and environmental a e and other run off liabilities 
subsequent to the ace ina acquisition in  we have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts 
with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts  products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business 
although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business  several contracts remain in force and principally include multi year retrospectively rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers 
because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products  relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met 
for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits  the insured desired to self insure a risk but was required  legally or otherwise  to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non payment from the insured 
a significant portion of ace tempest re usa business is written through quota share treaties approximately million of net premiums earned in  comprising million of first dollar quota share treaties and million of excess quota share treaties  a small portion of which are categorized as structured products 
structured quota share treaties typically contain relatively low aggregate policy limits  a feature that reduces loss coverage in some manner  and a profit sharing provision 
these have been deemed to have met risk transfer requirements 
reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts 
the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments 
the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers 
ceded ibnr  which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses  is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and  consequently  its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr refer to critical accounting estimates unpaid losses and loss expenses 
the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency  contractual dispute  or for other reasons 
amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and  in turn  shareholders equity 
changes in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income 
although the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions  the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future  and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures 
over this period of time  economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so  they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer 
this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate  although an element of judgment must be applied 
as part of the process  ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis 
the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts  adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses 
if actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience  the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change 
while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance  it could  nevertheless  have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded 

table of contents generally  we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer  net of collateral  and default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full 
the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in an ace only beneficiary trust  letters of credit  and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset 
we do not currently include multi beneficiary trusts 
however  we have several reinsurers that have established multi beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries 
the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating 
default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions 
significant considerations and assumptions include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency  and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population ie  default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages  the judgment exercised by management to determine the provision for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class 
default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa  aa  a  bbb  bb  b  and ccc  are percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
because the model we use is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency  we do not generally consider alternative factors 
however  when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly rated reinsurer  such as certain property catastrophe claims  a default factor may not be applied  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company  we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity  industry benchmarks  or other factors as considered appropriate 
we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class 
for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold  we generally apply a default factor of percent  for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision  we establish a default factor and resulting provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company 
upon initial notification of an insolvency  we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding  net of collateral  through a combination of write offs of recoverable balances and increases to the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer  we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding  net of collateral 
when sufficient credible information becomes available  we adjust the provision for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received  and for captives and other recoverables  management determines the provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances 
the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the provision for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december  gross reinsurance recoverables on losses and loss expenses recoverables net of usable collateral provision for uncollectible reinsurance in millions of us dollars type reinsurers with credit ratings reinsurers not rated reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers captives other structured settlements and pools total at december   the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers 
table of contents were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and our liquidity 
given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible provision  we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
however  based on the composition particularly the average credit quality of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december   we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers ie  from a to a or a to bbb could increase our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately million or approximately percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance  assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation 
while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period  a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other than temporary impairments otti each quarter  we review our securities in an unrealized loss position impaired securities  including fixed maturities  securities lending collateral  equity securities  and other investments  to identify those impaired securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential otti 
because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders equity  otti could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
refer to note d to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the process by which we evaluate investments for otti 
deferred tax assets many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each tax jurisdiction 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction  principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience 
the valuation allowance is also based on maintaining our ability and intent to hold our us available for sale fixed maturities to recovery 
if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component prove to be incorrect  or future market events occur that prevent our ability to hold our us fixed maturities to recovery  an additional valuation allowance could become necessary 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
at december   the valuation allowance of million including million with respect to foreign tax credits reflects management assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income and the inability of ace group holdings and its subsidiaries to utilize foreign tax credits 
fair value measurements the accounting guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three level valuation hierarchy in which inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value are classified 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets level inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable data level inputs 
inputs in level are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level includes inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include  among other items  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates and yield curves 
level inputs are unobservable and reflect our judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 

table of contents we categorize financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy at the balance sheet date based upon the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement 
accordingly  transfers between levels within the valuation hierarchy occur when there are significant changes to the inputs  such as increases or decreases in market activity  changes to the availability of current prices  changes to the transparency to underlying inputs  and whether there are significant variances in quoted prices 
transfers in and or out of any level are assumed to occur at the end of the period 
while we obtain values for the majority of the investment securities we hold from one or more pricing services  it is ultimately management s responsibility to determine whether the values obtained and recorded in the financial statements are representative of fair value 
we periodically update our understanding of the methodologies used by our pricing services in order to validate that the prices obtained from those services are consistent with the gaap definition of fair value as an exit price 
based on our understanding of the methodologies  our pricing services only produce an estimate of fair value if there is observable market information that would allow them to make a fair value estimate 
based on our understanding of the market inputs used by our pricing services  all applicable investments have been valued in accordance with gaap valuation principles 
we have controls to review significant price changes and stale pricing  and to ensure that prices received from pricing services have been accurately reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we do not typically adjust prices obtained from pricing services 
additionally  the valuation of fixed maturities is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs ie  stale pricing  which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur 
for a small number of fixed maturities  we obtain a quote from a broker typically a market maker 
due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only  we include these fair value estimates in level at december   level assets represented four percent of assets that are measured at fair value and three percent of total assets 
level liabilities represented percent of liabilities that are measured at fair value and two percent of our total liabilities 
during  we transferred assets of million into our level assets from other levels of the valuation hierarchy 
during  we transferred assets of million out of our level assets to other levels of the valuation hierarchy

we ceased writing this business in our glb reinsurance product meets the definition of a derivative for accounting purposes and is therefore carried at fair value 
we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect cash inflows or revenue as net premiums earned  and to record estimates of the average modeled value of future cash outflows as incurred losses 
accordingly  we recognize benefit reserves consistent with the accounting guidance related to accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts 
changes in the benefit reserves are reflected as policy benefits expense  which is included in life underwriting income 
the incremental difference between fair value and benefit reserves is reflected in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and related changes in fair value are reflected in net realized gains losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
we intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity ie  the expiration of the underlying liabilities through lapse  annuitization  death  or expiration of the reinsurance contract 
to partially offset the risk in the va guarantee reinsurance portfolio  we invest in derivative hedge instruments 
at maturity  the cumulative gains and losses will net to zero excluding cumulative hedge gains or losses because  over time  the insurance liability will be increased or decreased to equal our obligation 
for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates  equity indices  and other assumptions on the fair value of glbs  and the resulting impact on our net income  refer to item a 
for further description of this product and related accounting treatment  refer to note j to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of glb reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model  which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant that would assume these liabilities 
all of our treaties contain claim limits  which are factored into the valuation model 
the fair value depends on a number of factors  including interest rates  current account value  market volatility  expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior  and changes in policyholder mortality 
the model and related assumptions are continuously re evaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information  such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities 
due to the 
table of contents inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and the differences may be material 
the most significant policyholder behavior assumptions include lapse rates and the guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib annuitization rates 
assumptions regarding lapse rates and gmib annuitization rates differ by treaty but the underlying methodologies to determine rates applied to each treaty are comparable 
the assumptions regarding lapse and gmib annuitization rates determined for each treaty are based on a dynamic calculation that uses several underlying factors 
a lapse rate is the percentage of in force policies surrendered in a given calendar year 
all else equal  as lapse rates increase  ultimate claim payments will decrease 
key factors affecting the lapse rate assumption include investment performance and policy duration 
in general  the base lapse function assumes low lapse rates ranging from about percent to percent per annum during the surrender charge period of the variable annuity contract  followed by a spike lapse rate ranging from about percent to percent per annum in the year immediately following the surrender charge period  and then reverting to an ultimate lapse rate generally around percent per annum  typically over a year period 
this base rate is adjusted downward for policies with more valuable more in the money guarantees by multiplying the base lapse rate by a factor ranging from percent to percent 
additional lapses due to partial withdrawals and older policyholders with tax qualified contracts due to required minimum distributions are also included 
the gmib annuitization rate is the percentage of policies for which the policyholder will elect to annuitize using the guaranteed benefit provided under the gmib 
all else equal  as gmib annuitization rates increase  ultimate claim payments will increase  subject to treaty claim limits 
key factors affecting the gmib annuitization rate include investment performance and the level of interest rates after the gmib waiting period  since these factors determine the value of the guarantee to the policyholder 
in general  we assume that gmib annuitization rates will be higher for policies with more valuable more in the money guarantees 
in addition  we also assume that gmib annuitization rates are higher in the first year immediately following the waiting period the first year the policies are eligible to annuitize utilizing the gmib in comparison to all subsequent years 
we do not yet have a robust set of annuitization experience because most of our clients policyholders are not yet eligible to annuitize utilizing the gmib 
however  for certain clients representing approximately percent of the total gmib guaranteed value there are several years of annuitization experience for those clients the annuitization function reflects the actual experience and has a maximum annuitization rate per annum of percent a higher maximum applies in the first year a policy is eligible to annuitize utilizing the gmib it is over percent 
for most clients there is not a credible amount of observable relevant behavior data and so we use a weighted average with a heavier weighting on the observed experience noted previously of three different annuitization functions with maximum annuitization rates per annum of percent  percent  and percent  respectively with significantly higher rates in the first year a policy is eligible to annuitize utilizing the gmib 
as noted elsewhere  our gmib reinsurance treaties include claim limits to protect us in the event that actual annuitization behavior is significantly higher than expected 
based on our review  no material changes were made to actuarial or behavioral assumptions 
we made minor technical refinements to the model with a favorable net income impact of approximately million 
during  realized gains of million were associated with a decreased value of glb liabilities primarily due to rising equity levels partially offset by the unfavorable impact of interest rate movements and the impact of discounting future claims for one fewer year 
this excludes realized losses of million during the year ended december  on derivative hedge instruments held to partially offset the risk in the va guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment 
refer to the net realized and unrealized gains losses section for a breakdown of the realized gains losses on glb reinsurance and derivatives for the years ended december  and ace tempest life re employs a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of va guarantees 
risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design  with particular focus on protecting our position from policyholder options that  because of anti selective behavior  could adversely impact our obligation 
a second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts 
all va guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit s 
the different categories of claim limits are described below reinsurance programs covering guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb with an annual claim limit of two percent of account value 
this category accounts for approximately percent of the total reinsured gmdb guaranteed value 
approximately one percent of the guaranteed value in this category has additional reinsurance coverage for glb 

table of contents reinsurance programs covering gmdb with claim limit s that are a function of the underlying guaranteed value 
this category accounts for approximately percent of the total reinsured gmdb guaranteed value 
the annual claim limit expressed as a percentage of guaranteed value ranges from percent to percent 
approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category is also subject to annual claim deductibles that range from percent to percent of guaranteed value ie  our reinsurance coverage would only pay total annual claims in excess of percent to percent of the total guaranteed value 
approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category is also subject to an aggregate claim limit which was approximately million as of december  approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category has additional reinsurance coverage for glb 
reinsurance programs covering gmdb and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab 
this category accounts for approximately percent of the total reinsured glb guaranteed value and percent of the total reinsured gmdb guaranteed value 
these reinsurance programs are quota share agreements with the quota share decreasing as the ratio of account value to guaranteed value decreases 
the quota share is percent for ratios between percent and percent  percent for additional losses on ratios between percent and percent  and percent for further losses on ratios below percent 
approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category is also subject to a claim deductible of percent of guaranteed value ie  our reinsurance coverage would only pay when the ratio of account value to guaranteed value is below percent 
reinsurance programs covering gmib with an annual claim limit 
this category accounts for approximately percent of the total reinsured glb guaranteed value 
the annual claim limit is percent of guaranteed value on over percent of the guaranteed value in this category 
additionally  reinsurance programs in this category have an annual annuitization limit that ranges between percent and percent with approximately percent of guaranteed value subject to an annuitization limit of percent or under  and the remaining percent subject to an annuitization limit of percent 
approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category is also subject to minimum annuity conversion factors that limit the exposure to low interest rates 
approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category has additional reinsurance coverage for gmdb 
reinsurance programs covering gmib with aggregate claim limit 
this category accounts for approximately percent of the total reinsured glb guaranteed value 
the aggregate claim limit for reinsurance programs in this category is approximately billion 
additionally  reinsurance programs in this category have an annual annuitization limit of percent and approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category is also subject to minimum annuity conversion factors that limit the exposure to low interest rates 
approximately percent of guaranteed value in this category has additional reinsurance coverage for gmdb 
a third layer of risk management is the hedging strategy which looks to mitigate both long term economic loss over time as well as dampen income statement volatility 
ace tempest life re owned financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy with a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the instruments are substantially collateralized by our counterparties  on a daily basis 
we also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume 
the last substantive us transaction was quoted in mid and the last transaction in japan was quoted in late the aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals  annuitizations  and deaths at a rate of percent percent annually 

table of contents note that glb claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its waiting period 
the vast majority of policies we reinsure reach the end of their waiting periods in or later  as shown in the table below 
year of first payment eligibility percent of living benefit account values and prior and after total the following table presents the historical cash flows under these policies for the periods indicated

more than percent of our living benefit reinsurance clients policyholders are currently ineligible to trigger a claim payment 
the vast majority of these policyholders become eligible between years and at current market levels  we expect approximately million of claims and million of premium on living benefits over the next months 
collateral ace tempest life re holds collateral on behalf of most of its clients in the form of qualified assets in trust or letters of credit  typically in an amount sufficient for the client to obtain statutory reserve credit for the reinsurance 
the timing of the calculation and amount of the collateral varies by client according to the particulars of the reinsurance treaty and the statutory reserve guidelines of the client domicile 

table of contents goodwill impairment goodwill  which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired  was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
during  our goodwill balance increased by approximately four percent  primarily due to acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually  or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment 
the impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not ie  more than a percent probability that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
if a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment  a quantitative analysis is then used 
the quantitative analysis is a two step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and  if a potential impairment is present  the amount of impairment is measured and recorded 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level 
goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at acquisition 
the most significant reporting units are new york life korea operations and hong kong operations acquired in rain and hail insurance service  inc rain and hail acquired in  north american and international divisions of combined insurance acquired in  domestic and international divisions of ace ina acquired in  and ace tempest re catastrophe businesses acquired in and there are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions that are also assessed annually 
a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was prepared in for the north american division of combined insurance with a goodwill balance of million 
based on our impairment testing for  we determined that no impairment was required and that none of our reporting units were at risk for impairment 
to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  we consistently applied a combination of the following models an earnings multiple  a book value multiple  a discounted cash flow or an allocated market capitalization 
the earnings and book value models apply multiples  including the consideration of a control premium  of comparable publicly traded companies to forecasted earnings or book value of each reporting unit and consider current market transactions 
the discounted cash flow model applies a discount to estimated cash flows including a terminal value calculation 
the market capitalization model applies a control premium to our market capitalization and  as adjusted  compares the allocated market capitalization to the allocated book value of each reporting unit 
to determine an appropriate control premium  we considered both the mean and range of control premiums paid in our industry for recent transactions involving businesses similar to our reporting units 
we then selected a control premium within the range appropriate to our business 
we must assess whether the current fair value of our reporting units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units  including short term and long term growth rates  estimated cost of equity and changes in long term risk free interest rates  selection of appropriate earnings and book value market multiples to be used in various multiple approaches  and risk premium applied in determining discount rate for calculating net present value of estimated future cash flows 
if our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change in the future  goodwill could be materially adjusted 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken

six external investment managers are responsible for high yield security selection and portfolio construction 
our high yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience 
holdings are highly diversified across industries and subject to a percent issuer limit as a percentage of high yield allocation 
we monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system 
derivative and structured securities eg  credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations are not permitted in the high yield portfolio 
reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance the following table presents a composition of our reinsurance recoverable for the periods indicated in millions of us dollars december december reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and loss expenses net reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable on policy benefits net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and potential reinsurers on a regular basis and also monitor concentrations of credit risk with reinsurers 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the potential failure of reinsurers to indemnify us  primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies 
the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables  net of approximately of billion and billion of collateral at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses was primarily due to collections relating to prior period catastrophe events and run off operations and favorable prior period development  partially offset by increases in crop balances and superstorm sandy losses 
asbestos and environmental a e and other run off liabilities included in ace liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a e a e liabilities 
the a e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites 
the estimation of ace a e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal  social  and economic environment 
ace has not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a e reserves  which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  under item  for additional information 
reserving considerations for asbestos  ace faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers  distributors  installers  and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos 
claims can be filed by individual claimants or groups of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time 
claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured 

table of contents environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution 
it is common  especially for larger defendants  to be named as a potentially responsible party at multiple sites 
the following table presents count information by account for asbestos and environmental claims for the periods indicated  for direct policies only asbestos by causative agent open at beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year environmental by site open at beginning of year newly reported closed or otherwise disposed open at end of year asbestos and environmental claims count have been adjusted to present claims in a manner consistent with balances disclosed at december  closed or otherwise disposed claims were significantly higher in  compared with  due to a review of pending cases prior to transferring claim handling responsibilities from a nico subsidiary back to century indemnity company

the following table shows our gross and net survival ratios for our a e loss reserves and allocated loss adjustment expense alae reserves at december  and survival ratios survival ratios year year year year gross net gross net gross net gross net asbestos environmental total survival ratios have been adjusted to present claims in a manner consistent with balances disclosed at december  the net ratios reflect third party reinsurance other than the aggregate excess reinsurance provided under the nico contracts 
these survival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and alae reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years year survival ratio  and by asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments in year survival ratio 
the survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices  variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims  and levels of coverage provided 
we  therefore  urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy and note that the year survival ratios  particularly  are likely to move considerably from year to year for the reasons just described 
the year and year net survival ratios decreased in primarily due to several large settlement payments 

table of contents catastrophe management we actively monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world 
the following modeled loss information reflects our in force portfolio at october  and reinsurance program at january  the table below presents our modeled annual aggregate pre tax probable maximum loss pml  net of reinsurance  for year and year return periods for us hurricanes and california earthquakes at december  and the table also presents ace s corresponding share of pre tax industry losses for each of the return periods for us hurricanes and california earthquakes at december  and for example  according to the model  for the in return period scenario  there is a one percent chance that our losses incurred in any year from us hurricanes could be in excess of billion or six percent of our total shareholders equity at december  
we estimate that at such hypothetical loss levels  ace s share of aggregate industry losses would be approximately one percent 
us hurricanes california earthquakes december december december december modeled annual aggregate net pml ace of total shareholders equity of industry ace ace of total shareholders equity of industry ace in millions of us dollars  except for percentages in in the modeling estimates of both ace and industry loss levels are inherently uncertain owing to key assumptions 
first  while the use of third party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses is prevalent within the insurance industry  the models are reliant upon significant meteorology  seismology  and engineering assumptions to estimate hurricane and earthquake losses 
in particular  modeled hurricane and earthquake events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential 
second  there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models and the running of the modeling software 
third  we are reliant upon third party estimates of industry insured exposures and there is significant variation possible around the relationship between our loss and that of the industry following an event 
fourth  we assume that our reinsurance recoveries following an event are fully collectible 
these loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates 
natural catastrophe property reinsurance program ace s core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations ie  excluding our global reinsurance and life segments and consists of two separate towers 
we regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures 
this may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program s renewal date 
in addition  prior to each renewal date  we consider how much  if any  coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors  including modeled pml assessment at various return periods  reinsurance pricing  our risk tolerance and exposures  and various other structuring considerations 
the following table presents ace coverage under its general catastrophe treaty for both the north american and international towers  effective for the coverage periods indicated all dollar amounts are approximate 
with respect to tower north american  our core program renewed on january   for a period of one year

table of contents political risk  trade credit  and structured trade credit political risk insurance is a specialized coverage that provides clients with protection against unexpected  catastrophic political or macroeconomic events  primarily in developing markets 
we participate in this market through our wholly owned subsidiary sovereign risk insurance ltd 
sovereign  and through a unit of our london based agm operation 
sovereign is one of the world leading underwriters of political risk insurance and has a global portfolio spread across more than countries 
its clients include financial institutions  national export credit agencies  leading multilateral agencies  and multinational corporations 
agm writes political risk  trade credit  and structured trade credit business out of underwriting offices in london  england  hamburg  germany  new york  new york and los angeles  california  in the us  and singapore 
our political risk insurance provides protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans  insulates investors against equity losses  and protects exporters against defaults on contracts 
commercial lenders  our largest client segment  are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation  expropriation or nationalization by the host government  currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions  or war or other acts of political violence 
in addition  in the case of loans to government owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee  political risk policies cover scheduled payments against risks of non payment or non honoring of government guarantees 
equity investors and corporations receive similar coverage to that of lenders  except they are protected against financial losses  inability to repatriate dividends  and physical damage to their operations caused by covered events 
our export contracts protection provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions  including non payment by government entities 
agm trade credit and structured trade credit businesses cover losses due to insolvency  protracted default  and political risk perils including export and license cancellation 
it provides trade credit coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems  with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage 
its structured trade credit business provides coverage to trade finance banks  exporters  and trading companies  with exposure to trade related financing instruments 
we have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk  trade credit  and structured credit businesses 
these include basic loss sharing features that include co insurance and deductibles  and in the case of trade credit  the use of non qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess 
ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to agree on recovery strategies  and the subrogation of the rights of the lender exporter to the insurer following a claim 
we have the option to pay claims over the original loan payment schedule  rather than in a lump sum in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries 
it is important to note that political risk  trade credit  and structured trade credit policies are named peril conditional contracts  not financial guarantees  and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled 
political risk  trade credit  and structured trade credit insurance do not cover currency devaluations  bond defaults  any form of derivatives  movements in overseas equity markets  transactions deemed illegal  or situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred  or debt that is not legally enforceable 
in addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy by policy basis  we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk 
these measures include placing country and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings  combined single loss limits on multi country policies  the use of reinsurance protection  and regular modeling and stress testing of the portfolio 
crop insurance we are  and have been since the s  one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the us and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of rain and hail 
we provide protection throughout the us on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified  which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region 
our crop insurance business comprises two components multiple peril crop insurance mpci and crop hail insurance 
the mpci program is offered in conjunction with the us department of agriculture usda 
the policies cover revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought  excessive moisture  hail  wind  frost  insects  and disease 
generally  policies have deductibles ranging from percent to percent of the insured risk 
the usda risk management agency rma sets the policy terms and conditions  rates and forms  and is also responsible for setting compliance standards 
as a participating company  we report all details of policies underwritten to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement sra 
the sra sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal crop insurance 
table of contents corporation fcic concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro rata and state stop loss provisions which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results 
in addition to the pro rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra  we also purchase third party stop loss reinsurance for our mpci business to reduce our exposure 
each year the rma issues a final sra for the subsequent reinsurance year 
in june  the rma released the sra which establishes the terms and conditions for the reinsurance year ie  july  through june  that replaced the sra 
there were no significant changes in the terms and conditions 
on the mpci business  we recognize net premiums written as we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the us and these reports allow us to determine the actual premium associated with the liability that is being planted 
the mpci program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases  the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year 
once the net premium written has been booked  the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops 
a majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the sra in effect at the beginning of the year 
given the major crops covered in the program  we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters 
the rating of mpci premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility 
for instance  in most states the rating for the mpci revenue product for corn includes a factor that is based on the average price in february of the chicago board of trade december corn futures 
to the extent that the corn commodity prices are higher in february than they were in the previous february  and all other factors are the same  the increase in corn prices will increase the corn premium year over year 
our crop hail program is a private offering 
premium is earned on the crop hail program over the coverage period of the policy 
given the very short nature of the growing season  most crop hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters with the earned premium also more heavily occurring during this time frame 
we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered 
the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and or fire  and related costs such as transit to storage 
we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self insure for a reduced premium cost 
we limit our crop hail exposures through the use of township liability limits  quota share reinsurance cessions  and state stop loss reinsurance on our net retained hail business 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet the short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
as a holding company  ace limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments 
in addition to net investment income  ace limited cash flows depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments 
historically  these dividends and other payments have come from ace bermuda based operating subsidiaries  which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries 
our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written  fees  net investment income  and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims  operating expenses  and dividends and to service debt and purchase investments 
we anticipate that positive cash flows from operations underwriting activities and investment income should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term 
should the need arise  we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities 
refer to credit facilities below for additional information 
our access to funds under existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments 
our existing credit facilities have remaining terms expiring between and and require that we maintain certain financial covenants  all of which we met at december  should any of our existing credit providers experience financial difficulty  we may be required to replace credit sources  possibly in a difficult market 
there has also been recent consolidation in the banking industry which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to particular institutions 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms  on a timely basis or at all  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
to date  we have not experienced difficulty accessing any of our credit facilities 
to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims  we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments 
in addition  for certain insurance  reinsurance  or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows  we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with 
table of contents the related liabilities 
with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio  we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments 
all things being equal  in a low interest rate environment  the overall duration of our fixed maturities tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment  such duration tends to be longer 
at december   the average duration of our fixed maturities years is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities years 
despite our safeguards  if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows  we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing 
potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time  large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses as a result of coverage disputes  reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business 
because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ace group of companies  the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level 
as a result  the probability of a liquidity strain  as described above  may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis 
if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary  we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments  potentially at distressed prices  as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations 
the payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction  as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations  including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies 
during  we were able to meet all of our obligations  including the payments of dividends on our common shares with our net cash flows 
we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors 
considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision 
ace limited received dividends of million and million from its bermuda subsidiaries in and  respectively 
the payment of any dividends from agm or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable uk insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  the release of funds by syndicate to subsidiaries of agm is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd 
ace limited received no dividends from agm in and million in the us insurance subsidiaries of ace ina may pay dividends  without prior regulatory approval  subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary domicile or  if applicable  commercial domicile 
ace ina international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities 
ace limited did not receive any dividends from ace ina in and debt issued by ace ina is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by ace ina insurance subsidiaries to ace ina as well as other group resources 
cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance  sometimes substantially in advance  of the time claims are paid 
generally  cash flows are affected by claim payments that  due to the nature of our operations  may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods 
refer to contractual obligations and commitments for our estimate of future claim payments by period 
sources of liquidity include cash from operations  routine sales of investments  and financing arrangements 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for   and the operating cash flows reflect net income for each period  adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were billion in  compared with billion in both and net loss and loss expenses paid were billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
operating cash flows included reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million for   and  respectively  from the brandywine nico agreement  which was substantially exhausted as of december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in  respectively 
net investing activities for the indicated periods were related primarily to net purchases of fixed maturities 
cash used for investing activities also included acquisitions in   and refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our consolidated net cash flows used for financing activities were million in and million in  compared with cash flows from financing activities of million in in   and  financing activities included dividends paid on our common shares of million  million  and million  respectively 
financing cash flows included million of net proceeds  net of repayments  from issuance of short term debt in and billion in  compared with net repayments of million in financing cash flows also included share repurchases of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels  and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us  and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
in the current low interest rate environment  we utilize reverse repurchase agreements as a low cost alternative for short term funding needs and to address short term cash timing differences without disrupting our investment portfolio holdings 
we subsequently settle these transactions with future operating cash flows 
at december   there were billion in reverse repurchase agreements outstanding 
in addition to cash from operations  routine sales of investments  and financing arrangements  we have agreements with a third party bank provider which implemented two international multi currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency 
the programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption 
in each program  participating ace entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider 
each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency us dollars and then notionally pooled 
the bank extends overdraft credit to all participating ace entities as needed  provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero 
actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between legal entities 
ace entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short term liquidity needs 
any overdraft balances incurred under this program by an ace entity would be guaranteed by ace limited up to million in the aggregate 
our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating ace entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool 

table of contents capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
the following table summarizes the components of our capital resources december december in millions of us dollars  except for percentages short term debt long term debt total debt trust preferred securities total shareholders equity total capitalization ratio of debt to total capitalization ratio of debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization our ratios of debt to total capitalization and debt plus trust preferred securities to total capitalization have decreased due to the increase in shareholder equity discussed below 
we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions and our perceived financial strength 
we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time 
we generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited sec shelf registration which is renewed every three years 
this allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs

long term debt at both december  and  our total long term debt was billion as described in detail in note b and c to the consolidated financial statements 
trust preferred securities the securities outstanding consist of million of trust preferred securities due  issued by a special purpose entity a trust that is wholly owned by us 
the sole assets of the special purpose entity are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries 
the special purpose entity looks to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities 
we have guaranteed the payments on these debt instruments 
the trustees of the trust include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee  such as a trust company 
our officers serving as trustees of the trust do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity 
the full million of outstanding trust preferred securities calculated as million as discussed above plus our equity share of the trust is shown on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability 
additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in note d to the consolidated financial statements 
common shares our common shares had a par value of chf each at december  under swiss law  dividends must be stated in swiss francs though dividend payments are made by ace in us dollars 
following ace redomestication to switzerland in july through march  dividends were distributed by way of a par value reduction 
at the may annual general meeting  our shareholders approved dividend distributions from capital contribution reserves additional paid in capital through the transfer of dividends from additional paid in capital to retained earnings 
in november  the board of directors recommended that our shareholders approve a resolution to increase our quarterly dividend percent from per share to per share for the payment made on january  and the payment made on april  this proposed increase was approved by our shareholders at the january  extraordinary general meeting 
at the may annual general meeting  our shareholders approved an annual dividend distribution for the following year by way of a par value reduction equal to per share  or chf per share  calculated using the usd chf exchange rate as published in the wall street journal on may  the annual dividend is payable in four quarterly installments  with each installment equaling per share  provided that the swiss franc equivalent of that amount per share based on the then current usd chf exchange rate  taken together with the swiss franc equivalents of all other installments of this annual dividend  will not exceed percent of chf per share the aggregate distribution cap 
if the swiss franc equivalent of an upcoming dividend installment would cause the aggregate distribution cap to be exceeded  then that dividend installment will be reduced to equal the swiss franc amount remaining available under the aggregate distribution cap  and the us dollar amount distributed for that installment will be the then applicable us dollar equivalent of the remaining swiss franc amount 
dividend distributions on common shares amounted to chf per share for the year ended december  including par value reductions of chf per share

subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest  was million at december  we recognize accruals for interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had million in liabilities for income tax related interest and penalties in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement with respect to these liabilities 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above 
deposit liabilities deposit liabilities include reinsurance deposit liabilities of million and contract holder deposit funds of million at december  the reinsurance deposit liabilities arise from contracts we sold for which there is not a significant transfer of risk 
at contract inception  the deposit liability is equal to net cash received 
an accretion rate is established based on actuarial estimates whereby the deposit liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the term of the contract 
the deposit accretion rate is the rate of return required to fund expected future payment obligations 
we periodically reassess the estimated ultimate liability and related expected rate of return 
any resulting changes to the amount of the deposit liability are reflected as an adjustment to earnings to reflect the cumulative effect on the period the contract has been in force  and by an adjustment to the future accretion rate of the liability over the remaining estimated contract term 
additional information with respect to deposit liabilities is contained in note k to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents purchase obligations we are party to enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase certain services 
purchase obligations in the table primarily comprise audit fees and agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services 
limited partnerships funding commitments in connection with our investments in limited partnerships  we have commitments that may require funding over the next several years 
the timing of the payment of these commitments is uncertain and will differ from our estimated timing in the table 
operating lease commitments we lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through february we renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required 
estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts 
such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p c insurance and reinsurance company 
in contrast to other contractual obligations  cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract 
for example  we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts ie  when a loss event has not occurred and if a payment is to be made  the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract 
in the table above  we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december   and do not take into account reinsurance recoverable 
these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above  differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates 
estimated payments for future life and annuity policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts 
the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts 
the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts 
accordingly  the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet 
payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments  actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table 
credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are non admitted insurers and reinsurers in the us  the terms of certain us insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide collateral  which can be in the form of letters of credit locs

this facility replaces the billion syndicated letter of credit facility and million unsecured revolving credit facility that expired in november in november  we amended the loc facility agreements supporting agm underwriting capacity for syndicate which increased the aggregate amount of locs permitted to be issued from million to million and extended the expiry date from december to december we will continue to use most of the locs issued under the loc agreements primarily to support the ongoing funds at lloyd requirements of syndicate  but also for other general corporate purposes 
it is anticipated that our commercial facilities will be renewed on expiry but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by ace 
in the event that such credit support is insufficient  we could be required to provide alternative security to clients 
this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources 
the value of locs required is driven by  among other things  statutory liabilities reported by variable annuity guarantee reinsurance clients  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the expansion of business  and loss experience of such business 
the facilities in the table above require that we maintain certain covenants  all of which have been met at december  these covenants include i maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth in an amount not less than the minimum amount 
for the purpose of this calculation  the minimum amount is an amount equal to the sum of the base amount currently billion plus percent of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  ending after the date on which the current base amount became effective  plus percent of any increase in consolidated net worth during the same period  attributable to the issuance of common and preferred shares 
the minimum amount is subject to an annual reset provision 
ii maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than to under this covenant  debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity  except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than percent 
in this circumstance  the amount greater than percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio 
at december   a the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in i above was billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was billion and b our ratio of debt to total capitalization was to  which is below the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of to as described in ii above 
our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would  subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants  result in an event of default 
this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility 
our failure to repay material financial obligations  as well as our failure with respect to certain other events expressly identified  would result in an event of default under one or more of the facilities 
ratings ace limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength insurance ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies  including s p  am best  moody  and fitch 
the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies 
our internet site  www 
acegroup 
com  also contains some information about our ratings  which can be found under the investor information tab but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report 
financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies opinions of a company claims paying ability 
independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities 

table of contents credit ratings assess a company ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings 
if one or more of our ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
in addition  our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
for example  the agm capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the s p public debt rating of ace falls below bbb 
also  we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers 
in the event the s p or am best financial strength ratings of ace fall  we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium 
we estimate that at december   a one notch downgrade of our s p or am best financial strength ratings would result in an immaterial loss of premium or requirement for collateral to be posted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential losses from various market risks including changes in interest rates  equity prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
further  through writing the glb and gmdb products  we are exposed to volatility in the equity and credit markets  as well as interest rates 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities  denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our fixed income portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income through net realized gains losses when securities are sold or when we record an otti charge in net income 
changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on shareholders equity and comprehensive income and in certain instances  net income 
from time to time  we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures  options  swaps  and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market 
at december  and  our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security prices 
in addition  as part of our investing activity  we purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities tbas 
changes in the fair value of tbas are included in net realized gains losses and therefore  have an immediate effect on both our net income and shareholders equity 
we seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques  including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at december  our policies to address these risks in were not materially different from we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk fixed income portfolio and debt obligations our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations have exposure to interest rate risk 
changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations 
we monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions 

table of contents the following table presents the impact at december  and  on the fair value of our fixed income portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates of bps applied instantly across the us yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario in billions of us dollars  except for percentages fair value of fixed income portfolio pre tax impact of bps increase in interest rates in dollars as a percentage of total fixed income portfolio at fair value changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables 
although our debt and trust preferred securities collectively referred to as debt obligations are reported at amortized cost and not adjusted for fair value changes  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value  albeit there is no immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the impact at december  and  on the fair value of our debt obligations of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of bps applied instantly across the us yield curve an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario in millions of us dollars  except for percentages fair value of debt obligations impact of bps decrease in interest rates in dollars as a percentage of total debt obligations at fair value equity price risk equity portfolio our portfolio of equity securities  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in addition  we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments  which also have exposure to price risk 
our global equity portfolio  excluding our preferred equity securities and strategic emerging debt portfolio  is correlated with the msci world index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio 
our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non us equity markets 
the following table presents more information on our exposure to equity price risk at december  and in millions of us dollars fair value of equity securities pre tax impact of percent decline in market prices for equity exposures changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation depreciation and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non us companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies 
therefore  foreign currency exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is 
table of contents reviewed as part of our risk management process 
locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations 
the principal currencies creating foreign currency exchange rate risk for us are the british pound sterling  the euro  the yen  the canadian dollar  and the australian dollar

the benefit reserves are calculated in accordance with the guidance related to accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts 
changes in the benefit reserves are reflected as policy benefits expense  which is included in life underwriting income 
in addition  our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the glb liability fvl  which is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes 
the fvl established for a glb reinsurance contract represents the difference between the fair value of the contract and the benefit reserves 
changes in the fvl  net of associated changes in the calculated benefit reserves  are reflected as realized gains or losses 
ace views its variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance with the probability of long term economic loss relatively small  at the time of pricing 
adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income 
when evaluating these risks  we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long term economic net loss  as well as the short term accounting variations caused by these market movements 
therefore  we evaluate this business in terms of its long term economic risk and reward 
at december   management established benefit reserves based on the benefit ratio calculated using assumptions reflecting management s best estimate of the future performance of the variable annuity line of business 
management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short term market movements impact the benefit reserves 
the benefit reserves are based on the calculation of a long term benefit ratio or loss ratio for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance 
despite the long term nature of the risk  the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient 
management s best estimate reflected a judgment that the equity markets will exhibit average growth over the next several years 
management regularly examines both quantitative and qualitative analysis and for the year ended december   determined that no change to the benefit ratio was warranted 
the benefit ratio used to establish the benefit reserves at december   has averaged less than standard deviation from the calculated benefit ratios  averaging the periodic results from a year rolling period ending december  the guidance requires us to regularly evaluate estimates used and adjust the liability balance if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised 
ace evaluates its estimates regularly and management uses judgment to determine the extent to which the assumptions underlying the benefit ratio calculation used to establish benefit reserves should be adjusted 
the benefit ratio will be calculated based on management s expectation for the short term and long term performance of the variable annuity guarantee liability 
management s quantitative analysis includes a review of the differential between the benefit ratio used at the most recent valuation date and the benefit ratio calculated on subsequent dates 
the differential is measured in terms of the standard deviation of the distribution of benefit ratios reflecting  stochastic scenarios calculated on subsequent dates 
the benefit reserves and fvl calculations are directly affected by market factors  including equity levels  interest rate levels  credit risk  and implied volatilities  as well as policyholder behaviors  such as annuitization and lapse rates 
the tables below assume no changes to the benefit ratio used to establish the benefit reserves at december  and show the sensitivity  at december   of the fvl associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
in addition  the tables below present the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held hedge value to partially offset the risk in 
table of contents the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio 
the tables below are estimates of the sensitivities to instantaneous changes in economic inputs or actuarial assumptions 
the tables below do not reflect the expected quarterly run rate of net income generated by the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio if markets remain unchanged during the period 
all else equal  if markets remain unchanged during the period  the gross fvl will increase  resulting in a realized loss 
the realized loss occurs primarily because  during the period  we will collect premium while paying little or no claims on our glb reinsurance since most policies are not eligible to annuitize until or later 
this increases the gross fvl because future premiums are lower by the amount collected in the quarter  and also because future claims are discounted for a shorter period 
we refer to this increase in gross fvl as timing effect 
the unfavorable impact of timing effect on our gross fvl in a quarter is not reflected in the sensitivity tables below 
for this reason  when using the tables below to estimate the sensitivity of gross fvl in the first quarter to various changes  it is necessary to assume an additional million to million increase in gross fvl and realized losses 
however  the impact to net income is substantially mitigated because the majority of this realized loss is offset by the positive quarterly run rate of life underwriting income generated by the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio if markets remain unchanged during the period 
note that both the timing effect and the quarterly run rate of life underwriting income change over time as the book ages

our liabilities are sensitive to global equity markets in the following proportions percent percent us equity  percent percent international equity ex japan  percent percent japan equity 
our current hedge portfolio is sensitive to global equity markets in the following proportions percent us equity 
we would suggest using the s p index as a proxy for us equity  the msci eafe index as a proxy for international equity  and the topix as a proxy for japan equity 
our liabilities are also sensitive to global interest rates at various points on the yield curve  mainly the us treasury curve in the following proportions percent percent short term rates maturing in less than years  percent percent medium term rates maturing between years and years  inclusive  and percent percent long term rates maturing beyond years

the hedge 
table of contents sensitivity is from december  market levels and includes the impact of an adjustment to the hedge portfolio made subsequent to that date 
the above sensitivities are not directly additive because changes in one factor will affect the sensitivity to changes in other factors 
also  the sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors 
sensitivities may also vary due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the calculation of the fvl is based on internal models that include assumptions regarding future policyholder behavior  including lapse  annuitization  and asset allocation 
these assumptions impact both the absolute level of the fvl as well as the sensitivities to changes in market factors shown above 
additionally  actual sensitivity of our net income may differ from those disclosed in the tables above due to differences between short term market movements and management judgment regarding the long term assumptions implicit in our benefit ratios 
furthermore  the sensitivities above could vary by multiples of the sensitivities in the tables above

the total claim amount payable on reinsurance programs covering the gmdb risk only  if all the cedants policyholders were to die immediately at december  was approximately million 
this takes into account all applicable reinsurance treaty claim limits 
the treaty claim limits function as a ceiling on the net amount at risk as equity markets fall 
in addition  the claims payable if all of the policyholders were to die immediately declines as equity markets fall due to the specific nature of these claim limits  many of which are annual claim limits calculated as a percentage of the reinsured account value 
there is also some impact due to a small portion of the gmdb reinsurance under which claims are positively correlated to equity markets claims decrease as equity markets fall

for reinsurance programs covering the glb risk only  the net amount at risk is defined as the present value of future claim payments under the following assumptions policy account values and guaranteed values are fixed at the valuation date december  and  respectively  there are no deaths  lapses  or withdrawals  policyholders annuitize at a frequency most disadvantageous to ace in other words  annuitization at a level that maximizes claims taking into account the treaty limits under the terms of the reinsurance contracts  for annuitizing policyholders  the gmib claim is calculated using interest rates in line with those used in calculating the reserve  future claims are discounted in line with the discounting assumption used in the calculation of the benefit reserve averaging between percent and percent  and reinsurance coverage ends at the earlier of the maturity of the underlying variable annuity policy or the reinsurance treaty 
the treaty claim limits cause the net amount at risk to increase at a declining rate as equity markets fall 
c reinsurance covering both the gmdb and glb risks on the same underlying policyholders the table below presents the net amount at risk at december  following an immediate change in equity market levels  assuming all global equity markets are impacted equally 
equity shock in millions of us dollars  except percentages flat gmdb net amount at risk glb net amount at risk claims at immediate mortality at december  and  the gmdb net amount at risk from reinsurance programs covering both the gmdb and glb risks on the same underlying policyholders was million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the glb net amount at risk from reinsurance programs covering both the gmdb and glb risks on the same underlying policyholders was million and million  respectively 
these net amounts at risk reflect the interaction between the two types of benefits on any single policyholder eliminating double counting  and therefore the net amounts at risk should be considered additive 
in addition  the table presents the total claim amount payable on reinsurance programs covering both the gmdb and glb risks on the same underlying policyholders  if all of the cedants policyholders were to die immediately at december  this takes into account all applicable reinsurance treaty claim limits 
although this calculation shows an increase in death claims resulting from percent immediate mortality of all policyholders  the glb claims would be zero in this scenario 
for reinsurance programs covering both the gmdb and glb risks on the same underlying policyholders  the net amount at risk is defined as the present value of future claim payments under the following assumptions 
table of contents policy account values and guaranteed values are fixed at the valuation date december  and  respectively  there are no lapses  or withdrawals  mortality according to percent of the annuity mortality table  policyholders annuitize at a frequency most disadvantageous to ace in other words  annuitization at a level that maximizes claims taking into account the treaty limits under the terms of the reinsurance contracts  for annuitizing policyholders  the gmib claim is calculated using interest rates in line with those used in calculating the reserve  future claims are discounted in line with the discounting assumption used in the calculation of the benefit reserve averaging between percent and percent  and reinsurance coverage ends at the earlier of the maturity of the underlying variable annuity policy or the reinsurance treaty 
the treaty limits control the increase in the gmdb net amount at risk as equity markets fall 
the gmdb net amount at risk continues to grow as equity markets fall because most of these reinsurance treaties do not have annual claim limits calculated as a percentage of the underlying account value 
the treaty limits cause the glb net amount at risk to increase at a declining rate as equity markets fall
