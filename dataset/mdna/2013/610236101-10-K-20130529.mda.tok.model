item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data of monro expressed as a percentage of sales for the fiscal years indicated year ended fiscal march sales cost of sales  including distribution and occupancy costs gross profit operating  selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts  including without limitation statements made in this item and in item business  may contain statements of future expectations and other forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this annual report on form k  the words anticipates  believes  contemplates  see  could  estimate  intend  plans and variations thereof and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed 
these factors include  but are not necessarily limited to  product demand  dependence on and competition within the primary markets in which monro s stores are located  the need for and costs associated with store renovations and other capital expenditures  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive services and pricing  parts supply restraints or difficulties  industry regulation  risks relating to leverage and debt service including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates  continued availability of capital resources and financing  disruption or unauthorized access to our computer systems  risks relating to protection of customer and employee personal data  risks relating to litigation  risks relating to integration of acquired businesses  including goodwill impairment and the risks set forth in item a 
risk factors 
except as required by law  we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by us or on our behalf 
critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies listed below are those that are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 
inventory we evaluate whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and we believe inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically we have been able to return excess items to vendors for credit or sell such inventory to wholesalers 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets we have a history of growth through acquisitions 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the carrying value of goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews in accordance with accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets  which we typically perform in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances affecting our business 
because we have only one reporting unit which encompasses all operations including new acquisitions  we believe there is little risk of impairment 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value of goodwill 
if the qualitative factors are triggered  we perform the two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of our invested capital to the book value of our invested capital 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangibles and other long lived assets are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  as discussed above  in accordance with accounting guidance  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets even though realized actual cash flows are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 
self insurance reserves we are largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce our risk and better manage our overall loss exposure  we purchase stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts  and caps total losses in a fiscal year 
we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in our business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted 
for more complex reserve calculations  such as workers compensation  we use the services of an actuary on an annual basis to assist in determining the required reserve for open claims 
stock based compensation the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical changes in the market price of the company s common stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the terms and conditions of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the implied yield on zero coupon us treasury bonds with a remaining maturity equal to the expected term of the awards 
we use historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes 
income taxes our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates are calculated by legal entity and jurisdiction and are based on a number of factors  including our income  tax planning strategies  differences between tax laws and accounting rules  statutory tax rates and credits  uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 
we use significant judgment and estimates in evaluating our tax positions 
tax law and accounting rules often differ as to the timing and treatment of certain items of income and expense 
as a result  the tax rate reflected in our tax return the current or cash tax rate is different from the tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  while other differences are temporary as they reverse over time 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the tax reflected in our consolidated financial statements and tax bases 
we establish valuation allowances when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at any one time  our tax returns for several tax years are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing jurisdictions 
we establish tax liabilities in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes 
under the accounting guidance  the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of million related to new stores  of which million came from the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions 
offsetting this was a decrease in comparable store sales of 
additionally  there was a decrease in sales from closed stores amounting to million 
fiscal was a week year  and therefore  there were selling days as compared to selling days in fiscal adjusting for days  comparable store sales were down as occurred in previous years  we completed the bulk sale of approximately million of slower moving inventory to icon international  a barter company  in exchange for barter credits 
the margin recognized in these transactions is typically less than our normal profit margin 
the barter transaction that occurred in fiscal decreased gross profit and operating expenses by 
of sales 
during the year  stores were added and were closed 
at march   we had company operated stores in operation 
we believe that the decline in comparable store sales for fiscal resulted mainly from the continued weak us economy 
with the continuation of high gasoline prices  lack of consumer confidence and high unemployment  we believe that customers are continuing to defer tire purchases and service repairs  especially on higher ticket items 
additionally  we believe that the milder winter weather this and last year also led to consumers deferring tire purchases 
while it appears that repairs and tire purchases are being deferred more and for longer than in prior years  most can only be deferred for a period of time due to safety issues or state inspection requirements 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit for fiscal  as a percentage of sales  is due to several factors 
total material costs increased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
this was due to a shift in mix to the lower margin service and tire categories  the latter due in part to the acquisition of more tire stores 
distribution and occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales from the prior year as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales 
labor costs were relatively flat as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
operating expenses for fiscal were million or of sales compared with million or of sales for fiscal excluding the operating expenses related to the stores acquired in fiscal  operating expenses actually decreased by approximately million  after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal this demonstrates that the company experienced leverage in this line on a comparable store basis through focused cost control and pay plans which appropriately adjust for performance 
operating income in fiscal of million decreased compared to operating income of million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of sales from to 
net interest expense for fiscal increased by approximately million as compared to the prior year  and increased as a percentage of sales from 
to 
the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  increased by approximately million from fiscal  primarily related to an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our fiscal acquisitions 
largely offsetting this increase was a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of approximately basis points from the prior year due to a shift in the percentage of debt revolver vs 
capital leases outstanding at a lower rate 
additionally  amortization of financing fees over the higher outstanding revolving credit balance is causing a decrease in the weighted average interest rate 
our effective tax rate was and  respectively  of pre tax income in fiscal and the difference primarily relates to the accounting for uncertain tax positions which may vary from year to year 
net income for fiscal decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and earnings per diluted share decreased by from to due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was partially due to a comparable store sales increase of 
additionally  there was an increase of million related to new stores  of which million and million came from the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions  respectively 
partially offsetting this was a decrease in sales from closed stores amounting to million 
fiscal was a week year  and therefore  there were selling days as compared to selling days in fiscal year adjusting for days  comparable store sales were flat 
as occurred in previous years  during fiscal  we completed the bulk sale of approximately million of slower moving inventory to icon international  a barter company  in exchange for barter credits 
the margin recognized in these transactions is typically less than our normal profit margin 
however  the barter transactions for fiscal had no impact on gross profit  but decreased operating expenses by 
of sales as compared to fiscal there were no barter transactions in fiscal during the year  stores were added and were closed 
at march   we had company operated stores in operation 
we believe that the flat comparable store sales for fiscal resulted mainly from the continued weak us economy 
with the continuation of higher gasoline prices and lack of consumer confidence  we believe that customers are continuing to defer tire purchases and service repairs  especially on higher ticket items 
as evidence  tire sales  which have increased every year on a comparable store basis during the past three years  decreased slightly for fiscal when adjusted for days as compared to the prior year 
during the year  monro  like most all other tire retailers  experienced a decline in the sale of tire units  which is believed to be attributable to consumer resistance to steeply rising prices 
additionally  we believe that the milder winter weather this year led to consumers deferring tire purchases 
related tire categories such as alignment sales declined for fiscal as well 
we did have comparable store exhaust and brake sales increases for fiscal  supporting our belief that consumers are keeping their cars longer and repairing them instead of trading them in for new cars 
while it appears that some repairs and tire purchases are being deferred  most can only be deferred for a period of time due to safety issues or state inspection requirements 
when customers do come in to have their vehicles repaired  our belief that they spend more on average because the problem with their vehicle has worsened due to additional wear  as evidenced by an increase in the average sales per invoice for fiscal as compared to the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit for fiscal  as a percentage of sales  is due to several factors 
total material costs increased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
we experienced significant increases in oil and tire costs as compared to the prior year and  for competitive reasons  did not increase selling prices to the degree that would have preserved gross margin percentages at prior year levels 
higher margin categories  such as brakes and exhaust  which had comparable store increases in the fiscal year  helped to slightly offset the effect of tire and oil cost increases  as did cost reductions obtained through the use of direct import products 
distribution and occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of sales from the prior year as monro  with higher overall sales  was able to better leverage these largely fixed costs 
labor costs decreased as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year  mainly due to better control of payroll and improved labor efficiency as measured by sales per man hour 
operating expenses for fiscal were million or of sales compared with million or of sales for fiscal when removing the extra week in fiscal  operating expenses were of sales for fiscal the improvement in operating expenses as a percent of sales is largely due to focused cost control on higher sales 
within operating expenses  over million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are directly attributed to increased direct store expenses such as manager pay  advertising and supplies related to the fiscal acquisition stores and a full year of expenses for the fiscal acquisition stores 
on a comparable store basis  direct store expenses decreased million net of an increase of million in expense related to the rd week as compared to the prior year  demonstrating that we experienced leverage in this line through focused cost control 
we incurred million in costs related to acquisitions including million in due diligence expenses related to the unsuccessful acquisition of midas  inc other drivers of the dollar increases in sg a expenses were store support costs that increased by approximately million including increased workers compensation and health care costs  partially offset by decreased management bonus expense of million due to the company not attaining certain profit goals for fiscal additionally during the year  we sold seven stores for which a gain of million was recognized 
operating income in fiscal of million increased compared to operating income in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of sales from to 
net interest expense for fiscal increased by approximately 
million as compared to the same period in the prior year  and remained flat at 
of sales for the same periods 
the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  decreased by approximately million from fiscal  primarily related to a decrease in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate increased by approximately basis points in fiscal due to a shift to a larger percentage of debt capital lease vs 
revolver outstanding at a higher rate 
our effective tax rate was and  respectively  of pre tax income in fiscal and the difference primarily relates to the accounting for uncertain tax positions which may vary from year to year 
net income for fiscal increased by million  or  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and earnings per diluted share increased by from to due to the factors discussed above 
capital resources  contractual obligations and liquidity capital resources our primary capital requirements for fiscal were divided among the funding of acquisitions for million  as well as the upgrading of facilities and systems  including the completion of the approximate million expansion of our rochester  new york office and warehouse facility which began in fiscal  and funding of our store expansion program  all totaling million 
in fiscal  our primary capital requirements involved the funding of acquisitions for million  as well as the upgrading of facilities and systems  including million of construction in progress for the expansion of the rochester  new york office and warehouse facility  and systems and the funding of our store expansion program totaling million 
in both fiscal years and  capital requirements were primarily met by cash flow from operations and from our revolving credit facility 
in fiscal we intend to open approximately four new stores 
total capital required to open a new greenfield service store ranges  on average excluding the acquired stores and bj s locations  from  to  depending on whether the store is leased  owned or land leased 
total capital required to open a new greenfield tire leased location costs  on average  approximately  including  for equipment and  for inventory 
monro paid dividends of million in fiscal in may  monro s board of directors declared its intention to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per common share or common share equivalent beginning with the first quarter of fiscal we also plan to continue to seek suitable acquisition candidates 
management believes that we have sufficient resources available including cash flow from operations and bank financing to expand our business as currently planned for the next several years 
contractual obligations payments due by period under long term debt  other financing instruments and commitments are as follows total within year within to years within to years after years dollars in thousands principal payments on long term debt capital lease commitments financing obligations operating lease commitments total we believe that we can fulfill our contractual commitments utilizing our cash flow from operations and  if necessary  bank financing 
liquidity in june  we entered into a five year  million revolving credit facility agreement with seven banks the credit facility 
the credit facility amended and restated  in its entirety  the credit facility agreement previously entered into by monro as of july and amended from time to time 
the credit facility also provided an accordion feature permitting us to request an increase in availability of up to an additional million 
in december  the credit facility was amended to include the following the committed sum was increased by million to million  the term was extended for another one and a half years  such that the credit facility now expires in december  and the million accordion feature was maintained 
there were no other changes in terms including those related to covenants or interest rates 
there are now six banks participating in the syndication 
there was million outstanding under the credit facility at march  we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of march  during fiscal  the interest rate on the credit facility was basis points over libor 
within the credit facility  we have a sub facility of million for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit 
the line requires fees aggregating annually of the face amount of each standby letter of credit  payable quarterly in arrears 
there was million in an outstanding letter of credit at march  the net availability under the credit facility at march  was million 
specific terms of the credit facility permit the payment of cash dividends not to exceed of the prior year s net income  and permit mortgages and specific lease financing arrangements with other parties with certain limitations 
additionally  the credit facility is not secured by our real property  although we have agreed not to encumber our real property  with certain permissible exceptions 
the agreement also requires the maintenance of specified interest and rent coverage ratios 
in addition  we have financed certain store properties and vehicles with capital leases financing obligations  which amount to million and are due in installments through inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
monro has been successful  in many cases  in mitigating the effects of merchandise cost increases principally through the use of volume discounts and alternative vendors  as well as selling price increases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk monro is exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates 
at year end march and  approximately 
and  respectively  of our debt financing  excluding capital leases  was at fixed interest rates and therefore  the fair value of such debt financing is affected by changes in market interest rates 
our cash flow exposure on floating rate debt interest expense would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately million based upon our debt position at fiscal year ended march  and would not have materially fluctuated for the fiscal year ended march  given a change in libor 
debt financing  including current portion  had a carrying amount of million and a fair value of million as of march   as compared to a carrying amount of million and a fair value of million as of march
