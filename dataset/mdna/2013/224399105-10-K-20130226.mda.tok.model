for million 
gtc  also known as crane electronic manufacturing services  was included in our aerospace electronics segment  as part of the electronics group 
gtc had million in sales in competitive conditions our lines of business are conducted under highly competitive conditions in each of the geographic and product areas they serve 
because of the diversity of the classes of products manufactured and sold  they do not compete with the same companies in all geographic or product areas 
accordingly  it is not possible to estimate the precise number of competitors or to identify our competitive position  although we believe that we are a principal competitor in many of our markets 
our principal method of competition is production of quality products at competitive prices delivered in a timely and efficient manner 
our products have primary application in the aerospace  defense electronics  non residential construction  rv  transportation  automated merchandising  chemical  pharmaceutical  oil  gas  power  nuclear  building services and utilities 
as such  our revenues are dependent upon numerous unpredictable factors  including changes in market demand  general economic conditions and capital spending 
because these products are also sold in a wide variety of markets and applications  we do not believe we can reliably quantify or predict the possible effects upon our business resulting from such changes 
our engineering and product development activities are directed primarily toward improvement of existing products and adaptation of existing products to particular customer requirements as well as the development of new products 
we own numerous patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property  no one of which is of such importance that termination would materially affect our business 
from time to time  however  we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property 
page research and development research and development costs are expensed when incurred 
these costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were incurred primarily by the aerospace electronics segment 
our customers no customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in  and raw materials our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials  including steel  copper  cast iron  electronic components  aluminum  plastics and various petroleum based products 
we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world 
although market forces have generally caused increases in the costs of steel  copper and petroleum based products  there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business  and we believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs 
seasonal nature of business our business does not experience significant seasonality 
government contracts we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities  primarily involving products in our aerospace electronics segment and our fluid handling segment 
as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts 
for example  some government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts  criminal or civil sanctions  administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
for a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements  please refer to item a

risk factors 
the following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and risks confronting our business 
this discussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption forward looking information preceding part i  the information set forth under item  business and with the discussion of the business included in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware 
if any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury  and costs associated with these lawsuits may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and financial position 
we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury 
estimation of our ultimate exposure for asbestos related claims is subject to significant uncertainties  as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing  severity and quantity of claims 
our estimate of the future expense of these claims is derived from assumptions with respect to future claims  settlement and defense costs which are based on experience during the last few years and which may not prove reliable as predictors 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  depending on the nature of the alleged injury  the jurisdiction where filed and the quality of the product identification  or a significant upward or downward trend in the costs of defending claims  could change the estimated liability  as would substantial adverse verdicts at trial or on appeal 
a legislative solution or a structured settlement transaction could also change the estimated liability 
these uncertainties may result in us incurring future charges or increases to income to adjust the carrying value of recorded liabilities and assets  particularly if the number of claims and settlements and defense costs escalates or if legislation or another alternative solution is implemented  however  we are currently unable to predict such future events 
the resolution of these claims may take many years  and the effect on results of operations  cash flow and financial position in any given period from a revision to these estimates could be material 
as of december   we were one of a number of defendants in cases involving  pending claims filed in various state and federal courts that allege injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos 
see note  commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending claims  our historical settlement and defense costs for asbestos claims  the liability we have recorded in our financial statements for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  the asset we have recorded in our financial statements related to our estimated insurance coverage for asbestos claims  and uncertainties related to our net asbestos liability 
we have recorded a liability for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  and while it is probable that this amount will change and that we may incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after  which additional liabilities may be significant  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time 
macroeconomic fluctuations may harm our business  results of operations and stock price 
over the past few years  market and economic conditions in the global economy have been highly challenging with slower economic growth and a variety of problems  including turmoil in the credit and financial markets  concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions  the state of the housing markets and volatility in fuel prices and worldwide stock markets 
restrictions on credit availability have and could continue to adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and could result in decreases in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments 
similarly  credit restrictions may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy 
despite positive economic indicators seen since the beginning of  the overall rate of recovery experienced during was uneven and uncertainty continues to exist over the stability of the recovery 
contributing factors include persistent high unemployment in the us and europe  a slow recovery of the us and european housing market  government budget reduction plans  including the potential of mandatory reductions in us defense spending 
a return to unfavorable economic conditions  or even an increase in economic uncertainty  could harm our business by adversely affecting our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
see specific risks relating to our business segments 
page our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities  costs  litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate  which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water and establish standards for the generation  treatment  use  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 
failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties and damage to our reputation 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that our costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation  failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
we are required to comply with various import and export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers  particularly in our aerospace electronics and fluid handling segments  as discussed more fully under specific risks relating to our business segments 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
in addition  failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  fines  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
the prices of our raw materials can fluctuate dramatically  which may adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of certain raw materials that are critical to our profitability are volatile 
this volatility can have a significant impact on our profitability 
in our engineered materials segment  for example  profits could be adversely affected by further increases in resin and fiberglass material costs and by the inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their position in product cost and functionality against competing materials 
the costs in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments similarly are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel and copper 
while we have taken actions aimed at securing an adequate supply of raw materials at prices which are favorable to us  if the prices of critical raw materials increase  our operating costs could be negatively affected 
our ability to obtain parts and raw materials from our suppliers is uncertain  and any disruptions or delays in our supply chain could negatively affect our results of operations 
our operations require significant amounts of important parts and raw materials 
we are engaged in a continuous  company wide effort to concentrate our purchases of parts and raw materials on fewer suppliers  and to obtain parts from suppliers in low cost countries where possible 
if we are unable to procure these parts or raw materials  our operations may be disrupted  or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations 
we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices 
nonetheless  supplier capacity constraints  supplier production disruptions  supplier financial condition  price volatility or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
demand for our products is variable and subject to factors beyond our control  which could result in unanticipated events significantly impacting our results of operations 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in industries that are cyclical in nature or subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile 
these industries often are subject to fluctuations in domestic and international economies as well as to currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures 
reductions in the business levels of these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments 
in our aerospace electronics segment  for example  a significant decline in demand for air travel  or a decline in airline profitability generally  could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from our businesses 
our aerospace businesses could also be impacted to the extent that major aircraft manufacturers encountered production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits could be affected by declines in demand for truck trailers  rvs  or building products 
in our fluid handling segment  a slower recovery of the economy or major markets could reduce sales and profits  particularly if projects for which these businesses are suppliers or bidders are canceled or delayed 
results at our merchandising systems segment could be affected by sustained low employment levels  office occupancy rates and factors affecting vending operator profitability such as higher fuel  food and equipment financing costs 
page we could face potential product liability or warranty claims  we may not accurately estimate costs related to such claims  and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage available to cover such claims 
our products are used in a wide variety of commercial applications and certain residential applications 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability or other claims in the event our products are alleged to be defective or that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property 
we may in the future incur liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful 
moreover  any such lawsuits  whether or not successful  could result in adverse publicity to us  which could cause our sales to decline 
in addition  consistent with industry practice  we provide warranties on many of our products and we may experience costs of warranty or breach of contract claims if our products have defects in manufacture or design or they do not meet contractual specifications 
we estimate our future warranty costs based on historical trends and product sales  but we may fail to accurately estimate those costs and thereby fail to establish adequate warranty reserves for them 
we maintain insurance coverage to protect us against product liability claims  but that coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims that may arise or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost 
any liability not covered by insurance or that exceeds our established reserves could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to improve productivity  reduce costs and align manufacturing capacity with customer demand 
we are committed to continuous productivity improvement and continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs  simplify or improve global processes  and increase the reliability of order fulfillment and satisfaction of customer needs 
in order to operate more efficiently and control costs  from time to time we execute restructuring activities  which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations 
for example  in  the company recorded pre tax restructuring and related charges of million associated with repositioning actions designed to improve profitability beginning in  primarily in the european portion of the fluid handling segment 
however  our failure to respond to potential declines in global demand for our products and services and properly align our cost base would have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  which would limit our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our growth depends  in part  on continued sales of existing products  as well as the successful development and introduction of new products  which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors 
any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market  which could compromise our competitive position 
further  the development and introduction of new products may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital equipment  increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses 
we also may need to modify our systems and strategy in light of new products that we develop 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations related to new products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
pension expense and pension contributions associated with the company s retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending upon changes in actuarial assumptions and future market performance of plan assets 
a significant portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and post retirement benefit plans  the costs of which are dependent upon various assumptions  including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets  discount rates for future payment obligations  rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs 
in addition  funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and post retirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 
variances from these estimates could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
we may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions  or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential acquisition transactions 
our acquisition program attempts to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities  systems of internal control and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire 
integrating acquired operations  such as the recent acquisitions of wta and money controls or the pending acquisition of mei involves significant risks and uncertainties  including maintenance of uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  distraction of management s attention from normal business operations during the integration process  unplanned expenses associated with the integration efforts  and unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process  including legal contingencies 
page there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future  that we will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable  which could adversely impact our growth rate 
our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 
we face significant competition which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in the future 
while we are a principal competitor in most of our markets  all of our markets are highly competitive 
the competitors in many of our business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies  reduce costs and develop and introduce new products  and the ability of our business segments to achieve similar advances will be important to our competitive positions 
competitive pressures  including those discussed above  could cause one or more of our business segments to lose market share or could result in significant price erosion  either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states and face risks inherent in non domestic operations 
net sales and assets related to our operations outside the united states were and in  respectively  of our consolidated amounts 
these operations and transactions are subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risks of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices  adverse trade regulations and possible social  economic and political instability in the countries and regions in which we operate 
in addition  we expect that non us sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  declines in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  the british pound or the canadian dollar  could adversely affect our reported results  primarily in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments  as amounts earned in other countries are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
we are dependent on key personnel  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain additional personnel needed for us to sustain and grow our business as planned 
certain of our business segments and corporate offices are dependent upon highly qualified personnel  and we generally are dependent upon the continued efforts of key management employees 
we may have difficulty retaining such personnel or locating and hiring additional qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to successfully sustain and grow our business  which could impact our results of operations in a materially adverse manner 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective  our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 
we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods  however  increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized 
in addition  if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which may adversely affect our stock price 
failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks  including personally identifiable and other information  non compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information  or a violation of the company s privacy and security policies with respect to such information  could adversely affect us 
we are dependent on information technology networks and systems  including the internet  to process  transmit and store electronic information  and  in the normal course of our business  we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers  stockholders and employees 
the legal  regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber criminals around the world 
a significant actual or potential theft  loss  fraudulent use or misuse of customer  stockholder  employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise  non compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in costs  fines  litigation or regulatory action against us 
security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations 
we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 
page specific risks relating to our business segments aerospace electronics our aerospace electronics segment is particularly affected by economic conditions in the commercial and military aerospace industries which are cyclical in nature and affected by periodic downturns that are beyond our control 
although the operating environment faced by commercial airlines generally continued to improve through  uncertainty continues to exist 
the principal markets for manufacturers of commercial aircraft are large commercial airlines  which could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including current and predicted traffic levels  load factors  aircraft fuel pricing  worldwide airline profits  terrorism  pandemic health issues and general economic conditions 
our commercial business is also affected by the market for business jets which could be adversely impacted by a decline in business travel due to lower corporate profitability 
in addition  a portion of this segment s business is conducted under us government contracts and subcontracts  therefore  a reduction in congressional appropriations that affect defense spending or the ability of the us government to terminate our contracts could impact the performance of this business 
specifically  if the us congress fails to agree on a deficit reduction plan  mandatory reductions in defense are required under the law 
the extent and scope of these cuts is difficult to assess at this time 
any decrease in demand for new aircraft or equipment or use of existing aircraft and equipment will likely result in a decrease in demand of our products and services  and correspondingly  our revenues  thereby adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our sales to military customers are also affected by continued pressure on us and global defense spending and the level of activity in military flight operations 
furthermore  due to the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing commercial and military products to market  we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete 
in addition  if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations related to new products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we are required to comply with various export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts  including requirements related to procurement integrity  export control  employment practices  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  fines  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
engineered materials in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits could fall if there were a decline in demand or a loss in market share for products used for trucks  trailers  rvs and building product applications for which our business produce fiberglass panels 
in addition  profits could also be adversely affected by further increases in resin and fiberglass material costs  by the loss of a principal supplier or by an inability on the part of the business to maintain product cost and functionality advantages when compared to competing materials 
merchandising systems results at our merchandising systems businesses could be reduced by unfavorable economic conditions  including sustained or increased levels of manufacturing unemployment and office vacancies  inflation for key raw materials and continued increases in fuel costs 
in addition  delays in launching or supplying new products or an inability to achieve new product sales objectives  or unfavorable changes in gaming regulations affecting certain of our payment solutions customers would adversely affect our profitability 
results at our foreign locations have been and will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
fluid handling the markets for our fluid handling businesses products and services are fragmented and highly competitive 
we compete against large and well established national and global companies  as well as smaller regional and local companies 
while we compete based on technical expertise  timeliness of delivery  quality and reliability  the competitive influence of pricing has broadened as a result of the generally weaker global economy 
demand for most of our products and services depend on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures by our customers depends in turn on general economic conditions  availability of credit and expectation of future market behavior 
additionally  volatility in commodity prices could negatively affect the level of these activities as could continued postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of projects 
while we experienced a gradual continued recovery in  orders in the fourth quarter of were weaker due to project delays  which could adversely affect our page future operating results 
in addition  to the extent we do not achieve targeted cost savings in connection with our repositioning actions  our operating results would also be adversely affected 
a portion of this segment s business is subject to government rules and regulations 
failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
in addition  at our foreign operations  reported results in us dollar terms could be eroded by a weakening of currency of the respective businesses  particularly where we operate using the euro  british pound and canadian dollar 
controls a number of factors could affect operating results of these businesses 
lower sales and earnings could result if our businesses cannot maintain their cost competitiveness  encounter delays in introducing new products or fail to achieve their new product sales objectives 
results could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the industrial machinery  oil and gas or heavy equipment industries

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item of this annual report on form k 
we are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products 
our business consists of five segments aerospace electronics  engineered materials  merchandising systems  fluid handling and controls 
our primary markets are aerospace  defense electronics  non residential construction  recreational vehicle rv  transportation  automated merchandising  chemical  pharmaceutical  oil  gas  power  nuclear  building services and utilities 
our strategy is to grow the earnings of niche businesses with leading market shares  acquire companies that fit strategically with existing businesses  aggressively pursue operational and strategic linkages among our businesses  build a performance culture focused on continuous improvement and a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of the shareholders and maintain a focused  efficient corporate structure 
items affecting comparability of reported results the comparability of our operating results from continuing operations for the years ended december   and is affected by the following significant items acquisition transaction costs during  we recorded non deductible transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of mei of million 
during  we recorded transaction costs associated with the acquisition of money controls of million 
restructuring and related costs in  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges and related costs of million  of which million was associated with repositioning actions designed to improve profitability beginning in  primarily in the european portion of the fluid handling segment 
included in the repositioning actions are million of non cash charges related to the completion of previous restructuring actions 
during  we recorded pre tax restructuring and related charges in the business segments totaling million 
the charges are primarily related to plant consolidations associated with our crane energy flow solutions business and redundant costs associated with our money controls acquisition 
asbestos charge with the assistance of hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a  a nationally recognized expert in the field  effective as of december   we updated and extended our estimate of the asbestos liability  including the costs of settlement or indemnity payments and defense costs relating to currently pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through our previous estimate was for asbestos claims filed or projected to be filed through as a result of this updated estimate  we recorded an additional liability of million as of december  our decision to take this action at such date was based on several factors which contribute to our ability to reasonably estimate this liability for the additional period noted  as follows the number of mesothelioma claims which  although constituting approximately of our total pending asbestos claims  have accounted for approximately of our aggregate settlement and defense costs being filed against us and associated settlement costs have recently stabilized 
in our opinion  the outlook for mesothelioma claims expected to be filed and resolved in the forecast period is reasonably stable 
there have been favorable developments in the trend of case law  which has been a contributing factor in stabilizing the asbestos claims activity and related settlement costs 
there have been significant actions taken by certain state legislatures and courts over the past several years that have reduced the number and types of claims that can proceed to trial  which has been a significant factor in stabilizing the asbestos claims activity 
we have now entered into coverage in place agreements with almost all of our excess insurers  which enable us to project a more stable relationship between settlement and defense costs paid by us and reimbursements from our insurers 
taking all of these factors into account  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos liability for pending claims and future claims to be filed through while it is probable that we will incur additional charges for asbestos liabilities and defense costs in excess of the amounts currently provided  we do not believe that any such amount can be reasonably estimated beyond accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be incurred for claims which may be made subsequent to the liability was million and million offset in part by a corresponding insurance receivable of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental charge for environmental matters  the company records a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that the company will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated 
generally  third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs 
the environmental remediation liability as of december  and is substantially related to the former manufacturing site in goodyear  arizona the goodyear site discussed below 
the goodyear site was operated by unidynamics phoenix  inc upi  which became an indirect subsidiary of the company in when the company acquired upi s parent company  unidynamics corporation 
upi manufactured explosive and pyrotechnic compounds at the goodyear site  including components for critical military programs  from to  under contracts with the us department of defense and other government agencies and certain of their prime contractors 
no manufacturing operations have been conducted at the goodyear site since the goodyear site was placed on the national priorities list in  and is now part of the phoenix goodyear airport north superfund goodyear site 
in  the epa issued administrative orders requiring upi to design and carry out certain remedial actions  which upi has done 
on july   the company entered into a consent decree with the epa with respect to the goodyear site providing for  among other things  a work plan for further investigation and remediation activities at the goodyear site 
the remediation activities have changed over time due in part to the changing groundwater flow rates and contaminant plume direction  and required changes and upgrades to the remediation equipment in operation at the goodyear site 
these changes have resulted in the company revising its liability estimate from time to time 
as of december   the liability was million 
during the fourth quarter of  additional remediation activities were determined to be required  in consultation with our advisors  to further address the migration of the contaminant plume 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  extending the accrued costs through it is not possible at this point to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation in excess of our current accruals through the forecast period because of the aforementioned uncertainties  in particular  the continued significant changes in the goodyear site conditions and additional expectations of remediation activities experienced in recent years 
as of december  and  the liability was million and million  respectively 
reinvestment of non us earnings associated with our acquisition of money controls in december  we considered whether it was necessary to maintain a previously established deferred tax liability representing the additional income tax due upon the ultimate repatriation of a portion of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
we considered our history of utilizing non us cash to acquire overseas businesses  our current and future needs for cash outside the united states  our ability to satisfy us based cash needs with cash generated by our us operations  and tax reform proposals calling for lower us corporate tax rates 
based on these factors  we concluded that as of december   all of our non us subsidiaries earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states  and as a result  we reversed the aforementioned deferred tax liability and recorded a million tax benefit in page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results from continuing operations for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  vs favorable unfavorable change vs favorable unfavorable change in millions  except net sales aerospace electronics engineered materials merchandising systems fluid handling controls total net sales sales growth core business acquisitions dispositions foreign exchange total sales growth operating profit from continuing operations aerospace electronics engineered materials merchandising systems fluid handling controls total segment operating profit from continuing operations corporate expense corporate asbestos charge nm nm corporate environmental charge nm nm total operating profit from continuing operations operating margin aerospace electronics engineered materials merchandising systems fluid handling controls total segment operating profit margin from continuing operations total operating margin from continuing operations the disclosure of total segment operating profit and total segment operating profit margin provides supplemental information to assist management and investors in analyzing our profitability but is considered a non gaap financial measure when presented in any context other than the required reconciliation to operating profit in accordance with asc disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
management believes that the disclosure of total segment operating profit and total segment operating profit margin  non gaap financial measures  present additional useful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods  providing investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business 
management also uses these non gaap financial measures in making financial  operating  planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating our performance

page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the tax benefit associated with our charges for asbestos and environmental was the most significant reason our effective tax rate from continuing operations was negative in further  these charges reduced our income before tax from continuing operations to such a level that all our tax adjustments had a larger impact on our effective tax rate from continuing operations than they otherwise would have 
when compared to our effective tax rate from continuing operations  our effective tax rate from continuing operations reflects a lower benefit from both non us taxes and the non us federal research and development tax credit due to its statutory expiration as of december   and higher state taxes 
these items were partially offset by a higher tax benefit from domestic manufacturing activities and a lower amount of non deductible expenses 
a reconciliation of the statutory us federal tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k

taking this into account  a lower amount of non us taxes also reduced our effective tax rate from continuing operations

consistent with our philosophy of balanced capital deployment  in  we paid dividends of million dividends per share increased from to in july  we repurchased stock for million  and we announced our plans to acquire mei for million 
our current cash balance of million  cash we expect to generate from future operations  the million available under our existing committed revolving credit facility  and the million of bank loan commitments in support of our pending acquisition of mei are expected to be sufficient to finance our short and long term capital requirements  as well as fund payments associated with our asbestos and environmental exposures and expected pension contributions 
we have an estimated liability of million for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  and while it is probable that this amount will change and we may incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after  which additional liabilities may be material  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time

page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook overall our sales depend heavily on industries that are cyclical in nature  or are subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile 
these industries are subject to fluctuations in domestic and international economies as well as to currency fluctuations  inflationary pressures  and commodity costs 
the global economic outlook remains uncertain due  in part  to persistent high unemployment in the us and europe  a slow recovery in us and european housing market and undetermined government budget reduction plans 
although a slow global economy is likely  we believe we are well positioned to achieve profitable growth in we expect a combination of repositioning savings approximately million expected in  continued cost management actions and gains in market share to drive profitable growth in specifically  in  we expect total year over year sales growth of to and growth in operating profit of to 
aerospace electronics in  we believe market conditions in the aerospace industry will remain generally positive and  accordingly  we expect sales growth in our aerospace group as we benefit from increasing oem build rates across a broad range of platforms 
we forecast slightly improved results for our electronics group despite reductions in overall defense spending 
we believe our aerospace electronics backlog  combined with orders we expect to receive in  is supportive of a modest increase in sales for  with an accompanying increase in operating profit aided by strong productivity initiatives 
engineered materials in  we expect nominal growth in sales volume with minor growth in our end markets overall 
operating profit in our engineered materials segment is expected to increase as we benefit from continued cost management initiatives and repositioning actions completed in merchandising systems in  we expect modest sales improvement for our merchandising systems segment  reflecting slightly improved global demand for both vending and payment solution products and the impact of share gain initiatives and new product introductions 
operating profit is expected to improve led by continued strong productivity and the benefits of the repositioning actions completed in fluid handling for  in our fluid handling segment  we expect modest sales growth reflecting slow growing end use markets  particularly in europe 
we expect improvement in both operating profit and operating margins over levels  reflecting strong productivity and savings from previously announced repositioning actions pre tax savings from these actions are expected to approximate million in and leverage of higher sales 
although chemical industry demand in north america slowed during the course of  quote activity remains encouraging and chemical investments in the middle east are generally moving forward 
while refining quote activity also slowed in  demand remains positive and we expect this trend to continue in in addition  we anticipate refinery turnaround activities will continue in demand from global power markets is expected to remain soft although some project releases are expected in we remain cautious about power projects in china and india 
in canada  we expect stable to growing commercial construction and mining activity to continue to benefit our pipe  valve  and fitting distribution business 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and  therefore  are critical to understanding our results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
sales revenue is recorded when title risk of loss passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue on long term  fixed price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
sales under cost reimbursement type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
accounts receivable 
we continually monitor collections from customers  and in addition to providing an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a customer s financial condition  we record a provision for estimated credit losses when customer accounts exceed days past due 
we aggressively pursue collection efforts on these overdue accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both december  and inventories 
inventories include the costs of material  labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years 
as actual future demand or market conditions vary from those projected by us  adjustments will be required 
domestic inventories are stated at either the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method or the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we use lifo for certain domestic locations  which is allowable under us gaap  primarily because this method was elected for tax purposes and thus required for financial statement reporting purposes 
inventories held in foreign locations are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
the lifo method is not being used at our foreign locations as such a method is not allowable for tax purposes 
changes in the levels of lifo inventories have increased costs of sales by million and reduced cost of sales by million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the portion of inventories costed using the lifo method was and of consolidated inventories at december  and  respectively 
if inventories that were valued using the lifo method had been valued under the fifo method  they would have been higher by million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset or asset group  or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the long lived asset or asset group  as well as specific appraisal in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other long lived assets or asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
judgments we make which impact these assessments relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods due to either changing assumptions or changing facts and circumstances 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year s in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization  we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
where  based on the weight of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that  in our judgment  is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the evidence we consider in reaching such conclusions includes  but is not limited to  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback year s if carryback is permitted under the tax law  cumulative losses in recent years  a history of tax losses or credit carryforwards expiring unused  a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief it limits realization of tax benefits  and a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the carryforward and support showing that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
we account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with asc topic  which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation  based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line of the consolidated statement of operations  while accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line of the consolidated balance sheets 
in determining whether the earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested overseas  we consider the following our history of utilizing non us cash to acquire non us businesses  our current and future needs for cash outside the us us  to fund capital expenditures  business operations  potential acquisitions  etc  our ability to satisfy us based cash needs us  domestic pension contributions  interest payment on external debt  dividends to shareholders  etc 
with cash generated by our us businesses  and the effect us tax reform proposals calling for reduced corporate income tax rates and or repatriation tax holidays would have on the amount of the tax liability 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we follow the provisions under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc as it relates to the accounting for goodwill in our consolidated financial statements 
these provisions require that we  on at least an annual basis  evaluate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and attributed and compare that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing takes place more often than annually if events or circumstances indicate a change in the impairment status 
a reporting unit is an operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment a component  in which case the component would be the reporting unit 
in certain instances  we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 
at december   we had reporting units 
when performing our annual impairment assessment  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying value 
goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are established primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital which varies for each reporting unit and which  as of our most recent annual impairment assessment  ranged between and a weighted average of  reflecting the respective inherent business risk of each of the reporting units tested 
this methodology for valuing the company s reporting units commonly referred to as the income method has not changed since the prior year 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts  which change from year to year 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases reductions 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions  including changes in market conditions  and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
in addition to the foregoing  for each reporting unit  market multiples are used to corroborate our discounted cash flow results where fair value is estimated based on earnings before income taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda multiples determined by available public information of comparable businesses 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units  it is possible a material page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations change could occur 
if actual results are not consistent with management s estimates and assumptions  goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 
furthermore  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical  reasonably possible decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
the results of this hypothetical decrease would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our carrying value for each of our reporting units 
no impairment charges have been required during  and as of december   we had million of net intangible assets of which million were intangibles with indefinite useful lives  consisting of trade names 
we amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite 
indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible exceeds the fair value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value 
fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows 
contingencies 
the categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability  the amount of our liability accruals  and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies

asbestos liability and related insurance coverage and receivable 
as of december   we had an aggregate asbestos liability of million for pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through december  estimation of our exposure for asbestos related claims is subject to significant uncertainties  as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing  severity and quantity of claims and the manner of their resolution 
we have retained the firm of hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a  a nationally recognized expert in the field  to assist management in estimating our asbestos liability in the tort system 
hr a reviews information provided by us concerning claims filed  settled and dismissed  amounts paid in settlements and relevant claim information such as the nature of the asbestos related disease asserted by the claimant  the jurisdiction where filed and the time lag from filing to disposition of the claim 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on our experience during a base reference period of eleven quarterly periods consisting of the two full preceding calendar years and three additional quarterly periods to the estimate date for claims filed  settled and dismissed 
our experience is then compared to the results of widely used previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of individuals likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
using that information  hr a estimates the number of future claims that would be filed against us through our forecast period and estimates the aggregate settlement or indemnity costs that would be incurred to resolve both pending and future claims based upon the average settlement costs by disease during the reference period 
after discussions with us  hr a augments our liability estimate for the costs of defending asbestos claims in the tort system using a forecast from us which is based upon discussions with our defense counsel 
based on this information  hr a compiles an estimate of our asbestos liability for pending and future claims expected to be filed through the indicated forecast period 
the most significant factors affecting the liability estimate are the number of new mesothelioma claims filed against us  the average settlement costs for mesothelioma claims  the percentage of mesothelioma claims dismissed against us and the aggregate defense costs incurred by us 
these factors are interdependent  and no one factor predominates in determining the liability estimate 
although the methodology used by hr a can be applied to show claims and costs for periods subsequent to the indicated period up to and including the endpoint of the epidemiological studies referred to above  management believes that the level of uncertainty regarding the various factors used in estimating future asbestos costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims  the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the indicated estimate 
through december   our actual experience during the updated reference period for mesothelioma claims filed and dismissed generally approximated the assumptions in our liability estimate 
in addition to this claims experience  we considered additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of the aging of pending claims  significant appellate rulings and legislative developments  and their respective effects on expected future settlement values 
based on this evaluation  we determined that no change in the estimate was warranted for the period ended december  nevertheless  if certain factors show a pattern of sustained increase or decrease  the liability could change materially  however  all the assumptions used in estimating the asbestos liability are interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the liability estimate 
because of the uncertainty with regard to and the interdependency of such factors used in the calculation of our asbestos liability  and since no one factor predominates  we believe that a range of potential liability estimates beyond the indicated forecast period cannot be reasonably estimated 
in conjunction with developing the aggregate liability estimate referenced above  we also developed an estimate of probable insurance recoveries for our asbestos liabilities 
as of december   we had an aggregate asbestos receivable of million 
in developing this estimate  we considered our coverage in place and other settlement agreements  as well as a number of additional factors 
these additional factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method by which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies  how settlement and defense page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations costs will be covered by the insurance policies and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships 
environmental 
for environmental matters  we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated 
generally  third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs 
the environmental remediation liability at december  is substantially all for the former manufacturing site in goodyear  arizona the goodyear site 
as of december   the total estimated gross liability for the goodyear site was million 
on july   we entered into a consent decree with the us department of justice on behalf of the department of defense and the department of energy pursuant to which  among other things  the us government reimburses us for of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the goodyear site 
as of december   the total estimated receivable from the us government related to the environmental remediation liabilities of the goodyear site was million 
pension plans 
in the united states  we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately of all us employees 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced that pension eligible employees will no longer earn future benefits in the domestic defined benefit pension plan effective january  the benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis  except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service 
this plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for federal or other income tax purposes 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date 
a number of our non us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately of all non us employees 
the benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation 
these plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for tax purposes or mandated by local statutory requirements 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date 
the net periodic pension cost was million in  million in and million in employer cash contributions were million in  million in and million in of which million and million were made on a discretionary basis to our us defined benefit pension plan in and  respectively 
we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of approximately million to our pension plans in cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 
for the pension plan  holding all other factors constant  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return of plan assets by percentage points would have increased us pension expense by million for us pension plans and million for us pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  a decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension cost by percentage points would have increased pension expense by million for us pension plans and million for us pension plans 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated pension benefits december  benefit obligations us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase net periodic benefit cost us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the long term expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions were determined with input from independent investment consultants and plan actuaries  utilizing asset pricing models and considering historic returns 
the discount rates we used for valuing pension liabilities are based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligation 
postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we and certain of our subsidiaries provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to current and former employees hired before january   who meet minimum age and years of service requirements 
we do not pre fund these benefits and retain the right to modify or terminate the plans 
we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of million to our postretirement benefit plans in the weighted average discount rates assumed to determine postretirement benefit obligations were  and for   and  respectively 
the health care cost trend rates assumed were  and in  and  respectively 
see note  pension and postretirement benefits  to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposures to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
total debt outstanding was million at december   substantially all of which was at fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the following is an analysis of the potential changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates based upon sensitivity analysis that models effects of shifts in rates 
these are not forecasts 
our year end portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate debt  therefore  the effect of a market change in interest rates would not be significant 
if  on january   currency exchange rates were to decline against the us dollar and the decline remained in place for  based on our year end portfolio  net income would not be materially impacted
