item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
given the multiple year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content licenses  if subscriber acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations  our margins may be adversely impacted 
payment terms for streaming licenses  especially programming that initially airs in the applicable territory on our service original programming or that is considered output content  will typically require more up front cash payments than other licensing agreements 
to the extent subscriber and or revenue growth do not meet our expectations  our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content licensing commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain licenses 
in addition  the long term and fixed cost nature of our streaming licenses may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in our 
table of contents business and the market segments in which we operate 
as we expand internationally  we must license content in advance of entering into a new geographical market 
if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in the applicable territory  acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long term and fixed cost nature of our commitments  we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 
changes in consumer viewing habits  including more widespread usage of tv everywhere or other similar on demand methods of entertainment video consumption could adversely affect our business 
the manner in which consumers view entertainment video is changing rapidly 
digital cable  wireless and internet content providers are continuing to improve technologies  content offerings  user interface  and business models that allow consumers to access on demand entertainment with interactive capabilities including start  stop and rewind 
the devices through which entertainment video can be consumed are also changing rapidly 
today  content from mvpds may be viewed on laptops and content from internet content providers may be viewed on tvs 
although we provide our own internet based delivery of content allowing our subscribers to stream certain tv shows and movies to their internet connected televisions and other devices  if other providers of entertainment video address the changes in consumer viewing habits in a manner that is better able to meet content distributor and consumer needs and expectations  our business could be adversely affected 
if we are not able to manage change and growth  our business could be adversely affected 
we are currently engaged in an effort to expand our operations internationally  scale our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both subscribers and features related to our service  as well as continue to operate our dvd service within the us as we expand internationally  we are managing our business to address varied content offerings  consumer customs and practices  in particular those dealing with e commerce and internet video  as well as differing legal and regulatory environments 
as we scale our streaming service  we are developing technology and utilizing relatively new third party internet based or cloud computing services 
we have also chosen to separate the technology that operates our dvd by mail service from that which runs our streaming operations 
if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business  including maintaining our dvd operations  and improving  refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations  our business may be adversely affected 
if the market segment for online subscription based entertainment video saturates  our business will be adversely affected 
the market segment for online subscription based entertainment video has grown significantly 
much of the increasing growth can be attributed to the ability of our subscribers to stream tv shows and movies on their tvs  computers and mobile devices 
as we face more competition in our market segment  our rate of growth relative to overall growth in the segment may decline 
further  a decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online subscription based entertainment video is beginning to saturate 
while we believe that this segment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future  if this market segment were to saturate  our business would be adversely affected 
if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful  we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers  and our operating results may be adversely affected 
we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity 
we believe that strong brand identity will be important in attracting and retaining subscribers who may have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video 
to build a strong brand we believe we must continue to offer content and service features that our subscribers value and enjoy 
we also believe that these must be coupled with effective consumer communications  such as marketing  customer service and public relations 
if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful  our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected 
such a result  coupled with the increasingly long term and fixed cost nature of our content acquisition licenses  may adversely affect our operating results 
from time to time  our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service  including among other things  our title selection  pricing  delivery speed and service interruptions 
furthermore  third party devices that enable instant streaming of tv shows and movies from netflix may not meet consumer expectations 
to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed  our brand may be adversely impacted and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected 
in  we made a series of announcements regarding our business  including the separation of our dvd by mail and streaming plans with a corresponding price change for some of our customers  the rebranding of our dvd by mail service  and the subsequent retraction of our plans to rebrand our dvd by mail service 
consumers reacted negatively to these announcements  adversely impacting our brand and resulting in higher than expected customer cancellations  which negatively affected our operating results 
while we have seen significant improvements to our brand since the events of  we nonetheless believe that it will continue to take time to repair our brand to the levels we enjoyed prior to the events of 
table of contents with respect to our expansion into international markets  we will also need to establish our brand and to the extent we are not successful  our business in new markets would be adversely impacted 
changes in our subscriber acquisition sources could adversely affect our marketing expenses and subscriber levels may be adversely affected 
we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers 
we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts  including paid search listings  banner ads  text links and permission based e mails  as well as our affiliate program 
we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service 
in addition  we have engaged in various offline marketing programs  including tv and radio advertising  direct mail and print campaigns  consumer package and mailing insertions 
we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership 
we maintain an active public relations program  including through social media sites such as facebook and twitter  to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition 
we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals 
if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources  or if the cost of our existing sources increases  our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us  become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business 
if companies that currently promote our service decide that we are negatively impacting their business  that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors  we may no longer be given access to such marketing channels 
in addition  if ad rates increase  we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our marketing costs 
laws and regulations impose restrictions on or otherwise prohibit the use of certain acquisition channels  including commercial e mail and direct mail 
we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such practices intrusive or damaging to our brand 
if the available marketing channels are curtailed  our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 
if we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
as a distributor of content  we face potential liability for negligence  copyright  or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute 
we also may face potential liability for content used in member reviews 
if we become liable  then our business may suffer 
litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations 
we cannot assure that we are indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us  and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 
if studios and other content providers refuse to license streaming content to us upon acceptable terms  our business could be adversely affected 
our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly depends on studios and other content providers licensing us content specifically for internet delivery 
the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary 
if the studios and other content providers change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to license us content  our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected 
unlike dvd  streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine 
as such  we are completely dependent on the various content providers to license us content in order to access and stream content 
many of the licenses provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly 
because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take  content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice 
in addition  the studios and other content providers have great flexibility in licensing streaming content 
they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content 
for example  hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros 
and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services  including netflix 
as such  netflix cannot license certain warner bros 
content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros 
may nonetheless license the same content on a transactional basis 
conversely  content providers may license the same content to multiple subscription based services and may do so on different terms and conditions 
as such  netflix and its competitors may offer consumers many of the same content titles but license these at different rates 
as competition increases  we may see the cost for programming increase 
as we seek to differentiate our service  we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content 
we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner 
within this context  we are selective about the titles we add and renew our service 
if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content  our subscriber acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us  including on an exclusive basis in some cases  our ability to stream tv shows and movies to our subscribers will be adversely impacted  and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted 
we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 
we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs  macs and other internet connected devices  including blu ray players and tvs  digital video players  game consoles and mobile devices 
we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time 
if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships  or if we encounter technological  content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content  our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted 
our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if  upon expiration  a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us  which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service 
furthermore  devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance  the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business 
in addition  technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices 
if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices  our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 
if subscriptions to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated  our business could be adversely affected the number of subscriptions to our dvd by mail offering is declining  and we anticipate that this decline will continue 
we believe  however  that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business 
in addition  we believe that dvd will be a valuable consumer proposition and studio profit center for the next several years  even as dvd sales decline 
the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund losses arising from our growth internationally 
to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvd by mail business is greater than we anticipate  our business could be adversely affected 
because we are primarily focused on building a global streaming service  the resources allocated to maintaining dvd operations and the level of management focus on our dvd business are limited 
we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved 
to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvd by mail service  subscribers satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvd by mail subscriber cancellations  which could adversely impact our business 
if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine  our business could be adversely affected 
under us copyright law  once a dvd is sold into the market  those obtaining the dvd are permitted to re sell it  rent it or otherwise dispose of it 
this is commonly referred to as the first sale doctrine 
while the vast majority of our dvd content acquisitions are direct from content providers  the first sale doctrine provides us with an option to acquire content from other third parties should the content providers refuse to deal with us on acceptable terms 
if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine  our ability to obtain dvd content and then rent it could be adversely affected 
increased availability of new releases to other distribution channels prior to  or on parity with  the release on dvd  and or the delayed availability of such dvds through our service  could adversely affect our business 
over the past several years  we have seen content providers adjust and experiment with the various distribution channels and content release timing 
further  our licensing agreements with several studios require that we do not rent new release dvds until some period of time after such dvds are first made available for retail sale 
these shifting distribution channels  their associated timing and or the delayed availability of such dvds through our service may negatively impact subscribers perception of value in our service  which could adversely affect our business 
moreover  if we are unable to negotiate favorable terms to acquire dvds  our contribution profits may be adversely affected 
any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 
our reputation and ability to attract  retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations 
interruptions in these systems  or with the internet in general  could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill 
table of contents dvd selections 
from time to time  we experience service interruptions and have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage 
service interruptions  errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 
our servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions and periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss  misuse or theft of data 
any attempt by hackers to disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems  if successful  could harm our business  be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation 
we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future 
our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access 
efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems 
any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operation 
we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third party web hosting provider 
in addition  we utilize third party internet based or cloud computing services in connection with our business operations 
we also utilize our own and third party content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet 
problems faced by us or our third party web hosting  cloud computing  or content delivery network providers  including technological or business related disruptions  could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers 
in addition  fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely 
as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems  a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business 
we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 
amazon web services aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations  or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service 
we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing  storage capabilities and other services provided by aws 
currently  we run the vast majority of our computing on aws 
given this  along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider  any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 
while the retail side of amazon competes with us  we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 
if we experience difficulties with the operation and implementation of open connect  our single purpose netflix content delivery network cdn  our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted in addition to general purpose commercial cdns  we have enabled internet service providers isps to obtain our streaming content from open connect  a single purpose netflix content delivery network that we have established 
given our size and growth  we believe it makes economic sense to have our own specialized cdn 
we will continue to work with our commercial cdn partners for the next few years  but eventually we expect the vast majority of our streaming bits will be served by open connect 
open connect will provide the netflix bits at no cost to the locations the isp desires  or isps can choose to get the netflix bits at common internet exchanges 
to the extent isps do not interconnect with open connect or if we experience difficulties in operating the open connect cdn service  our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our subscribers could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected 
failure to implement open connect could require us to engage third party solutions to deliver our content to isps  which could increase our costs and negatively affect our operating results 
if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology or develop user interfaces that maintain or increase subscriber engagement with our service  our business may suffer 
our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers 
we also develop  test and implement various user interfaces across multiple devices  in an effort to maintain and increase subscriber engagement with our service 

table of contents we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as our various user interfaces in an effort to improve the predictive accuracy of our tv show and movie recommendations and the usefulness of and engagement with our service by our subscribers 
we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements or other  third party recommendation or merchandising technology or interfaces may become more popular with or useful to our subscribers 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 
if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements thereto or otherwise improve our user interfaces  our service may be less useful to our subscribers 
such failures could lead to the following our subscriber satisfaction may decrease  subscribers may perceive our service to be of lower value and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected  and our ability to effectively merchandise and utilize our library will be adversely affected 
we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to stream tv shows and movies and to manage other aspects of our operations  and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 
we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations 
we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers 
future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the streaming of tv shows and movies to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner and or the processing of dvds among our shipping centers  our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 
in addition  if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly  our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 
also  any harm to our subscribers personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in us postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and subscriber satisfaction 
we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers 
increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our domestic dvd segment contribution profit 
the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on january  to cents 
it is expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years  which would result in increased shipping costs 
if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of first class mail  including changes in size  weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes  such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds  and our contribution margin could be adversely affected 
for example  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia recently instructed the postal regulatory commission prc to remedy discrimination by the postal service in the processing of dvds by mail  or to explain adequately why such discrimination is reasonable 
while we do not anticipate any material impact to our operations arising from this case  if the prc institutes a remedy that results in an increase in postage rates or changes the manner in which our dvd shipments are processed  our contribution margin could be adversely affected 
if the us postal service were to implement other changes to improve its financial position  such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions  such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change  we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business  or incur greater operating expenses 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws  which may impose additional burdens on us 
if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation  this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 
the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth  popularity or use of the internet  including laws limiting internet neutrality  could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 
for example  in late  the federal communications commission adopted so called net neutrality rules intended  in part  to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks 
the rules are currently subject to legal challenge 
to the extent that these rules are interpreted to enable network operators to engage in discriminatory practices or are overturned by legal challenge  our business could be adversely impacted 
as we expand internationally  government regulation concerning the internet  and in particular  network neutrality  may be nascent or non existent 
within 
table of contents such a regulatory environment  coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators  we could experience discriminatory or anti competitive practices that could impede our growth  cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 
changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 
we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet 
to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing  including meaningful bandwidth caps  or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers  we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted 
for example  in late  comcast informed level communications that it would require level to pay for the ability to access comcast network 
given that much of the traffic being requested by comcast customers is netflix streaming content stored with level  many commentators have looked to this situation as an example of comcast either discriminating against netflix traffic or trying to increase netflix operating costs 
furthermore  to the extent network operators were to create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers  our business could be negatively impacted 
most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming 
as such  companies like comcast  time warner cable and cablevision have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success 
for example  comcast exempted certain of its own internet video traffic eg  streampix videos to the xbox from a bandwidth cap that applies to all unaffiliated internet video traffic eg  netflix videos to the xbox 
while we believe that consumer demand  regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives  to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices  our business could be negatively impacted 
in international markets  especially in latin america  these same incentives apply however  the consumer demand  regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 
privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 
in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our subscribers  we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers 
we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information 
other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits 
increased regulation of data utilization practices  including self regulation or findings under existing laws  that limit our ability to use collected data  could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them  our business reputation could be adversely affected  and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results 
as our business evolves and as we expand internationally  we may become subject to additional and or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer information 
failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability  and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations  we could incur additional expenses 
our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data  particularly billing data  were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 
we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers  including names and  in many cases  mailing addresses 
with respect to billing data  such as credit card numbers  we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information 
we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data 
if  despite these measures  we  or our payment processing services  experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data  current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers  we could face legal claims  and our business could be adversely affected 
similarly  if a well publicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur  there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit and debit cards together  payment cards by them 
under current payment card practices  to the extent we do not obtain cardholders signatures  we are liable for fraudulent payment card transactions  even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders 
from time to time  fraudulent payment cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming 
typically  these payment cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards 
while we do have a number of other safeguards in place  we nonetheless experience some loss from 
table of contents these fraudulent transactions 
we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions 
a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 
increases in payment processing fees  changes to operating rules or the acceptance of new types of payment methods could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using payment cards 
our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees 
from time to time  these fees may increase  either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result of a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a cost per transaction basis 
such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to rules  regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods 
these rules  regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply 
if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements  we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods  and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we accept payment methods other than payment cards 
as our service continues to evolve and expand internationally  we will likely continue to explore accepting various forms of payment  which may have higher fees and costs than our currently accepted payment methods 
if more consumers utilize higher cost payment methods  our payment costs could increase and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors  the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished  and our business may be adversely affected 
we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships  as well as trademark  copyright  patent and trade secret protection laws  to protect our proprietary rights 
we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings 
we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications 
nevertheless  these applications may not be approved  third parties may challenge any patents or trademarks issued to or held by us  third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights  and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us 
if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties  the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished  competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations  the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace  and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 
intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to  among other things  our web site  streaming technology  our recommendation and merchandising technology  title selection processes and marketing activities 
trademark  copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies 
our intellectual property rights extend to our technology  business processes and the content on our web site 
we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights 
from time to time  third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights  successfully defend our use  or develop non infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement  misappropriation  misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position may be adversely affected 
many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business 
there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet 
we have not searched patents relative to our technology 
defending ourselves against intellectual property claims  whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor  results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel 
it also may result in our inability to use our current web site  streaming technology  our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products 
as a result of a dispute  we may have to develop non infringing technology  enter into royalty or licensing agreements  adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims 
these actions  if required  may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to protect our domain names  our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 
we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand  including netflix 
com 
failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service 

table of contents the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees 
governing bodies may establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
as a result  we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names 
furthermore  the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
we may be unable  without significant cost or at all  to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural or man made disaster  our operations could be adversely affected 
our executive offices and certain data centers are located in the san francisco bay area 
we have dvd shipping centers located throughout the us  including earthquake and hurricane sensitive areas 
our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts  fires  floods  power losses  telecommunications failures  break ins or similar events 
we may not be able to effectively shift our dvd fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events 
because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquake sensitive area  we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to  or total destruction of  our executive offices and data centers 
we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 
we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management time and attention 
from time to time  we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 
as we have grown  we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 
most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits  which are typically expensive to defend 
litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses  could occupy a significant amount of our management time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 
we could be subject to economic  political  regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 
we offer our streaming plan in canada  latin america and certain countries in europe the uk  ireland  finland  denmark  sweden  and norway 
operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory  economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business  including the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences  including licensing a certain portion of our content library before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  management distraction  political or social unrest and economic instability  compliance with us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act  export controls and economic sanctions  and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials  difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  less favorable foreign intellectual property laws  adverse tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the united states  non income related taxes such as value added tax or other indirect taxes  such as iss  pis  pis and pis in brazil  changes in tax laws or their interpretations  or the application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities given inter company transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk  profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds  
table of contents differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods  such as payment cards  new and different sources of competition  low usage and or penetration of internet connected consumer electronic devices  different and more stringent user protection  data protection  privacy and other laws  and availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion 
our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business  and results of our operations 
we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 
from time to time  we may seek to obtain additional capital  either through equity  equity linked or debt securities 
the decision to obtain additional capital will depend  among other things  on our business plans  operating performance and condition of the capital markets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
we have issued debt offerings and may incur additional debt in the future  which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 
as of december   we had million in senior notes and million in zero coupon senior convertible notes outstanding 
we also anticipate closing an offering of million in senior notes  a portion of the proceeds of which will be used to redeem our senior notes 
risks relating to our long term indebtedness include requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable 
in addition  it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the risks described above could intensify 
we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 
we rely on the continued service of our senior management  including our chief executive officer and co founder reed hastings  members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
in our industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel 
we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel  which may be disruptive to our operations 
risks related to our stock ownership provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
our charter documents may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they authorize our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and 
table of contents prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to certain delaware anti takeover provisions 
under delaware law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or  among other things  the board of directors has approved the transaction 
our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 
on november   we implemented a stockholder rights plan  also called a poison pill  which may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control of us by  among other things  making it uneconomical for a third party to acquire us on a hostile basis 
in addition  a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan  thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 
a small number of our stockholders could significantly influence our business 
as of december   we believe that our top five stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
these few significant stockholders  either individually or acting together  may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of the company or our assets 
this concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other stockholders to effect substantial changes in the company  may have the effect of delaying  preventing or expediting  as the case may be  a change in control of the company  and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  involvement of certain activist stockholders may impact our ability to recruit and retain talent or otherwise distract management 
further  the interests of these few stockholders may not be in the best interests of all stockholders 
our stock price is volatile 
the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly 
the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following  some of which are beyond our control variations in our operating results  variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts  investors and the financial community  announcements of developments affecting our business  systems or expansion plans by us or others  competition  including the introduction of new competitors  their pricing strategies and services  market volatility in general  the level of demand for our stock  including the amount of short interest in our stock  and the operating results of our competitors 
as a result of these and other factors  investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 
following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities  we became the subject of securities litigation 
we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility 
this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 
given the dynamic nature of our business  the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future  forecasts of our revenues  contribution margins  net income and  number of total and paid subscriber additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results 
such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock
