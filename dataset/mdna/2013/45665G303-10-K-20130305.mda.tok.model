item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i item a of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview overview we are an innovative drug discovery and development company seeking to discover  develop and deliver to patients best in class medicines designed to address diseases with significant unmet need 
we combine proven scientific expertise with a passion for developing novel small molecule drugs that target emerging disease pathways 
our programs focused on the inhibition of phosphoinositide kinase and heat shock protein are evidence of our innovative approach to drug discovery and development 
we have worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our development candidates and early discovery programs  subject to certain financial obligations to our current licensor and former development partners 
ipi  our lead product candidate  is a potent  oral inhibitor of class i pik delta and pik gamma  which we are investigating in both hematologic malignancies and inflammatory diseases 
we believe that ipi is the first pik delta  gamma inhibitor in clinical development 
the following is a summary of the clinical development of ipi to date hematologic malignancies we are conducting a phase  open label  dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of ipi in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies 
we are enrolling patients in five additional cohort expansions in the phase study to further evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics and activity of ipi in patients with the following hematologic malignancies chronic lymphocytic leukemia  indolent non hodgkin lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma t cell lymphomas aggressive b cell lymphomas myeloid neoplasms t cell or b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma we are planning to initiate at least two additional trials of ipi in patients with hematologic malignancies in inflammation we have completed a phase  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial of ipi in healthy adult subjects designed to support the development of ipi in inflammatory diseases 
we are conducting a phase a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial of ipi in patients with mild  allergic asthma 
we are planning to initiate in the first half of a phase  randomized  placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and activity of multiple doses of ipi in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 

table of contents in january  we announced our second potent  oral pik delta  gamma inhibitor  ipi we expect to complete in the second half of nonclinical studies designed to enable the initiation of phase clinical development 
our second clinical candidate  retaspimycin hydrochloride hcl  is a novel  potent and selective inhibitor of heat shock protein hsp 
we completed patient enrollment in a phase  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating retaspimycin hcl in combination with docetaxel  a chemotherapy  compared to placebo and docetaxel in patients with second or third line non small cell lung cancer nsclc  who are naive to docetaxel treatment and have a history of heavy smoking 
we stratified patients in our phase trial by squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma based on results from our phase b trial in which we observed partial responses in patients with squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  we are prospectively evaluating a novel biomarker that we believe may be predictive of response 
we expect to report topline overall survival data from this trial in the first half of we are also enrolling patients in a phase b trial to explore the safety and efficacy of retaspimycin hcl in combination with everolimus  an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor  pathway  in nsclc patients with a kras gene mutation 
the objective of this phase b trial is to determine the recommended dose for the combination treatment and to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of retaspimycin hcl in combination with everolimus 
we expect to provide an update from this phase b trial in the first half of in addition to our clinical stage programs  we have multiple innovative projects in earlier stages of development 
through our internal discovery efforts  we also discovered ipi  a novel  orally available inhibitor of faah 
it is believed that inhibition of faah may enable the body to bolster its own analgesic and anti inflammatory response  and may have applicability in a broad range of painful or inflammatory conditions 
we are currently seeking potential partnering opportunities for our faah program 
in june  we voluntarily stopped all company sponsored clinical trials of saridegib  our lead hedgehog pathway inhibitor 
strategic alliances millennium in july  we entered into a development and license agreement with intellikine  inc  or intellikine  under which we obtained rights to discover  develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products targeting the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik  including ipi we paid intellikine a million up front license fee 
the entirety of this fee was included as research and development expense in the year ended december   although million of this fee was paid in january during the second half of  we paid intellikine million in milestone payments associated with the initiation of two phase studies of ipi  which we recorded as research and development expense 
in january  intellikine was acquired by takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  acting through its millennium business unit 
we refer to our pik program licensor as millennium 
in december  we amended and restated our development and license agreement with millennium 
under the original agreement  we obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to millennium s portfolio of inhibitors of the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik for all indications  and we conducted a collaborative research program with millennium to identify compounds directed to pik delta and or pik gamma which meet certain selectivity criteria  with such research collaboration under the original agreement set to expire in july also under the original agreement  neither we nor millennium were permitted to research  develop or commercialize products directed pik delta and or pik gamma which meet certain selectivity criteria  other than the compounds subject to the collaboration  except that millennium was permitted to research  develop or commercialize such products that it was researching  developing or commercializing on its own or with a third party prior to its acquisition of intellikine 

table of contents under the terms of the amended and restated agreement  we retained our worldwide development and commercialization rights for products arising from the agreement for all therapeutic indications 
we and millennium will no longer conduct the collaborative research program and the restrictions on each party s ability to research  develop and commercialize products directed to the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik that meet certain selectivity criteria have terminated  subject  in the case of millennium  to the exclusive licenses granted to us under the amended and restated agreement 
additionally  under the amended and restated agreement  millennium waived the option it had under the original agreement to convert  upon payment of an option fee  its royalty interest in us sales of pik products and its right to receive certain milestone payments with respect to such products into the right to share in of profits and losses on us development and commercialization of those pik products for which the first phase clinical trial  as defined in the original agreement  was conducted in an oncology indication  and to participate in up to of the detailing effort for these products in the united states 
in consideration of such waiver we have agreed to pay to millennium million payable in installments 
we have paid million of the million during the year ended december  additionally  under the amended and restated agreement we have paid millennium a million milestone payment associated with the initiation of our phase a clinical trial of ipi in patients with mild  allergic asthma 
under the terms of the original agreement  the initiation of the phase a trial in asthma would not have required a milestone payment 
in addition to developing ipi  we announced our second potent  oral pik delta  gamma inhibitor  ipi  and we are seeking to identify additional novel inhibitors of pik delta and or pik gamma for future development 
during the year ended december   we paid millennium a million milestone payment for the initiation of the first ind enabling cglp toxicology study of ipi we are obligated to pay up to million in remaining success based milestones for the development of two distinct product candidates  and up to million in success based milestones for the approval and commercialization of two distinct products 
as a result of the amendment  such products may include products we license in from a third party 
in addition  we are obligated to pay millennium tiered royalties on worldwide net sales ranging from seven percent to percent  which are the same royalty levels as those specified under the original agreement  upon successful commercialization of products described in the agreement 
such royalties are payable until the later to occur of the expiration of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  subject to reduction  and limits on the number of products  in certain circumstances 
the amended and restated agreement expires on the later of the expiration of certain patents and the expiration of the royalty payment terms for the products  unless earlier terminated 
either party may terminate the agreement on days prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period  provided that the notice period is reduced to days where the alleged breach is non payment 
millennium may also terminate the agreement if we are not diligent in developing or commercializing the licensed products and do not  within three months after notice from millennium  demonstrate to millennium s reasonable satisfaction that we have not failed to be diligent 
the foregoing periods are subject to extension in certain circumstances 
additionally  millennium may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice if we or a related party bring an action challenging the validity of any of the licensed patents  provided that we have not withdrawn such action before the end of the day notice period 
we may terminate the agreement at any time upon days prior written notice 
the agreement also provides for customary reciprocal indemnification obligations of the parties 
mundipharma and purdue on july   we terminated our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue and entered into termination and revised relationship agreements with each of those entities  which we refer to as the termination agreements 
the alliance was previously governed by strategic alliance agreements that we entered into with each of mundipharma and purdue in november the strategic alliance agreement with purdue was focused on the development and commercialization in the united states of products targeting faah 
the 
table of contents agreement with mundipharma was focused on the development and commercialization outside of the united states of all products and product candidates that inhibit or target the hedgehog pathway  faah  pik  and product candidates arising out of our early discovery projects in all disease fields 
our hsp program was expressly excluded from the alliance 
under the terms of the termination agreements all intellectual property rights that we had previously licensed to mundipharma and purdue to develop and commercialize products under the previous strategic alliance agreements terminated  with the result that we have worldwide rights to all product candidates that had previously been covered by the strategic alliance 
we have no further obligation to provide research and development services to mundipharma and purdue as of july  mundipharma and purdue have no further obligation to provide research and development funding to us 
under the alliance  mundipharma was obligated to reimburse us for research and development expenses we incurred  up to an annual aggregate cap for each alliance program other than faah 
during the year ended december   we received million in research and development funding 
we recognized revenue for reimbursed research and development services we performed for mundipharma and purdue  including million in such revenue in the year ended december  we recognized million and million in such revenue  which included million and million  respectively  in revenue related to reimbursed research and development services for the transition of the faah program  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we did not record a liability for amounts previously funded by purdue and mundipharma as this relationship was not considered a financing arrangement 
we are obligated to pay mundipharma and purdue a four percent royalty in the aggregate subject to reduction as described below  on worldwide net sales of products that were covered by the alliance until such time as they have recovered approximately million  representing the research and development funding paid to us for research and development services performed by us through the termination of the strategic alliance 
after this cost recovery  our royalty obligations to mundipharma and purdue will be reduced to a one percent royalty on net sales in the united states of products that were previously subject to the strategic alliance 
all payments are contingent upon the successful commercialization of products subject to the alliance that are subject to significant further development 
as such  there is significant uncertainty about whether any such products will ever be approved or commercialized 
if no products are commercialized  no payments will be due by us to mundipharma and purdue  therefore  no amounts have been accrued 
royalties are payable under these agreements until the later to occur of the last to expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  provided that if royalties are payable solely on the basis of non patent regulatory exclusivity  each of the royalty rates is reduced by 
in addition  royalties payable under these agreements after mundipharma and purdue have recovered all research and development expenses paid to us are subject to reduction on account of third party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements which might be required to be paid by us if litigation were to arise  with any such reductions capped at of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period 
line of credit agreement in connection with the previous strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we also entered into a line of credit agreement with purdue and its independent associated company  purdue pharma lp  or pplp  that provided for the borrowing by us of one or more unsecured loans up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
in march  purdue assigned its interest under the line of credit agreement to pplp 
the extension of the line of credit at an interest rate below our incremental borrowing rate represented the transfer of 
table of contents additional value to us in the arrangement 
as such  we recorded the fair value of the line of credit of million as a loan commitment asset on our balance sheet in the fair value of the loan commitment asset was determined using a discounted cash flow model of the differential between the terms and rates of the line of credit and market rates 
we amortized the loan commitment asset to interest expense until we drew down the line of credit in november we recorded approximately million and million of related amortization expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in november  we borrowed million under this line of credit  which we recorded as long term debt 
the loan would have matured and was payable in full  including principal and any accrued interest  on april   which we referred to as the maturity date  and would have been subordinate to any senior indebtedness that we may have incurred 
the loan bore interest at a fluctuating rate set at the prime rate on the business day prior to the funding of the loan and reset on the last business day of each month ending thereafter 
at the time of the borrowing  the prime rate was 
interest was compounded on each successive three month anniversary following the date of borrowing 
upon drawing down the million under the line of credit agreement  we reclassified the loan commitment asset as a debt discount which reduced the debt on our balance sheet 
the unamortized balance of the loan commitment asset was million as of the date of borrowing 
we recorded interest expense on the net amount borrowed using the effective interest method 
we recorded million and million of related interest expense in the years ended december  and  respectively  using an effective interest rate of 
on september   upon completion of the sale and issuance of common stock to pplp under the securities purchase agreement described below  the line of credit agreement with pplp terminated in its entirety and approximately million in principal and interest owed to pplp under the line of credit agreement was extinguished 
securities purchase agreement in connection with the previous strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we also entered into a securities purchase agreement with purdue and pplp 
under the securities purchase agreement  we issued and sold in two separate closings an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
an equal number of securities were sold to each purchaser 
as of december   all warrants that were issued in connection with the strategic alliance expired without having been exercised 
we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses to mundipharma and purdue  which consisted of the excess of the amount paid for the purchased shares over the closing market price on the day before the equity closings and the value of the loan commitment asset 
we determined that the rights and licenses did not have stand alone value  and we considered all of the obligations under the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting 
there was no obligation for us to repay the million  and we had been recognizing the deferred revenue ratably over years  which was our estimated period of performance under the arrangement through july  we recognized million  million and million in deferred revenue associated with grant of rights and licenses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unamortized balance as of july  was reversed and included in the calculation of the gain on termination 
securities purchase agreement on july   in connection with the termination of the strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we executed a securities purchase agreement with pplp  which we refer to as the securities purchase agreement  under which we agreed to sell and issue  shares of our common stock to pplp and two entities associated with pplp  which we collectively refer to as the brp entities  at a price of per share for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the consideration was composed 
table of contents of extinguishment of approximately million in principal and interest owed to pplp under the line of credit agreement and million in cash 
we completed the sale and issuance on september  at which time the line of credit agreement with pplp terminated in its entirety 
the securities purchase agreement also provides that  at any time during the period beginning january  and ending december   in the event we propose to make an underwritten offering of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  the purdue entities will have piggyback registration rights  which require us  at the election of the purdue entities  to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to be included in such underwritten offering  common stock then held by the purdue entities representing up to of the total estimated maximum dollar amount of our common stock proposed to be sold in such underwritten offering 
in addition  the brp entities have agreed that during the period between july  and december   if requested by us and or the managing underwriters  placement agents or initial purchasers for any offering of our stock proposed by us during such period  not to  among other things  offer  sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of  directly or indirectly  any common stock held by the brp entities or to enter into any agreement that transfers  in whole or in part  any of the economic consequences of ownership of any common stock held by the brp entities  during such period as may be requested by such managing underwriters  the placement agents or the initial purchasers  and to execute a lock up agreement reflecting such restrictions  provided that all of our officers  directors and affiliates enter into similar agreements with equivalent terms 
the securities purchase agreement also terminated  as of july   all attendance rights to meetings of our board of directors held by the purdue entities 
the brp entities and each associated company holding shares of our common stock have agreed to be present at each regular or special meeting of our stockholders held through september   and to vote all of their shares as recommended by our board of directors in the proxy materials mailed to our stockholders in connection with such meeting 
however  with respect to any proposal to amend our corporate charter or approve certain extraordinary transactions  all shares of our common stock that are owned by those entities that are were not issued pursuant to the securities purchase agreement will be voted in proportion to the manner in which all of our stockholders other than those entities vote in respect of such proposal  regardless of the recommendation of our board of directors 
accounting impact of alliance termination  debt extinguishment and sale and issuance of common stock we recorded the following during the year ended december  gain on termination of purdue entities strategic alliance of million  additional equity on our balance sheet of million  extinguishment of million of debt on balance sheet  elimination of million of deferred revenue on balance sheet  and additional cash of million 
we considered the fact that certain elements of the arrangement discussed above closed before others  despite the fact that all of the elements were negotiated and signed concurrently in contemplation of one another 
in particular  the strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue was terminated on july   and therefore  there are no further deliverables required under those agreements 
however  the equity offering and debt extinguishment did not close at that time because certain regulatory events outside of our control had to occur prior to the closing 
as a result  we evaluated the termination of the strategic alliance separately from the financing transaction  including the extinguishment of debt and sale and issuance of stock 
we recorded the gain on termination of the mundipharma and purdue strategic alliance for million which represented our past 
table of contents performance under the collaboration because we have no further obligation to provide research and development  and the financial risk associated with the research and development has been transferred to the purdue entities 
in particular  any payment of royalties to mundipharma and purdue are conditional on the future commercialization of our product candidates 
to establish the financial impact of the stock issuance and debt extinguishment  we determined both the fair value of the common stock we sold and issued and the debt and accrued interest extinguished 
we consider mundipharma and purdue to be related parties for financial reporting purposes because of their equity ownership 
therefore  we recorded the difference between extinguishing the fair value of the debt and accrued interest  the sale and issuance of our common stock and receiving million in cash in additional paid in capital 
financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  contract service revenue and milestone payments received from our collaboration partners 
license fees were recognized as revenue ratably over the expected research and development period under our arrangement with mundipharma and purdue 
because our agreements with mundipharma and purdue also provided for funding for our research and development efforts  we recognized this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned in proportion to our forecasted total expenses as compared to the total research funding budget for the year 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any potential future revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development expense we are a drug discovery and development company 
our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  clinical testing costs  including payments made to contract research organizations  costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and materials  costs of manufacturing product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  costs associated with the licensing of research and development programs  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to external consultants  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs for collaboration partners to perform research activities  including development milestones for which a payment is due when achieved  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation of personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications  corporate development  human resources and commercial functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining our intellectual property portfolio 
other income and expense interest and investment income typically consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  net of interest expense  and amortization of warrants 
interest expense included amortization of the loan commitment asset from purdue entities  net  from april through november when we drew down the full million loan available under the line of credit agreement 
interest expense also included accrued interest on the long term debt  including amortization of the debt discount  through september  when the debt was extinguished 
income from massachusetts tax incentive award represents the pro rata amount earned for an award we received for headcount growth 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  and assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
differences between actual and estimated results have not been material and are adjusted in the period they become known 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition to date  all of our revenue has been generated under research collaboration agreements 
the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable  up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
on january   we adopted on a prospective basis a newly issued accounting standard related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we apply this standard to new revenue arrangements or material modifications of existing revenue arrangements 
this standard eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon our best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we recognized revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which was the research and development term 
we regularly considered whether events warranted a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would have caused us to modify the period of time over which we recognized revenue from the up front license fee on a prospective basis and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 
we recognized research and development funding as earned over 
table of contents the period of effort as related research and development costs are incurred in proportion to our forecasted total expenses as compared to the total expected research and development funding for the year 
we recognized the impact of any change in forecasted total expenses or expected research and development funding as a change in accounting estimate and recorded the impact of that change on a prospective basis 
on july   we mutually agreed with mundipharma and purdue to terminate our strategic alliance agreements 
on january   we adopted on a prospective basis a newly issued accounting standard related to the milestone method of revenue recognition 
we apply this standard to new revenue arrangements or material modifications to existing revenue arrangements 
at the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the clinical  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
we recognize revenues related to substantive milestones in full in the period in which the substantive milestone is achieved 
if a milestone payment is not considered substantive  we recognize the applicable milestone over the remaining period of performance 
our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue did not include potential milestone payments 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales by the licensee of licensed products in licensed territories in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenue to date 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high  respectively 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
our estimates of expenses in future periods may be over or under accrued 
stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity compensation 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of our equity instruments  including in selecting the inputs we use for the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any 
table of contents significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted and the associated compensation charge we record in our financial statements 
results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended december   and  in thousands  together with the change in each item as a percentage 
change change revenue research and development expense general and administrative expense gain on termination of purdue entities alliance interest expense interest and investment income income from massachusetts incentive tax award income from therapeutic discovery grants income tax benefit revenue our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  which includes million related to the transition of our faah program to mundipharma and purdue  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue  which includes million related to the transition of our faah program to mundipharma and purdue  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
in the absence of any potential business development activities that generate revenue  we do not expect to recognize any revenue in research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  
table of contents the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to million associated with the fair value of installment payments related to amended and restated agreement with millennium  and million associated with the achievement of a milestone for the initiation of a phase a clinical trial of ipi in patients with mild  allergic asthma and a million milestone for the initiation of the first ind enabling cglp toxicology study of ipi these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in pharmaceutical development expense due primarily to the discontinuation of company sponsored development of saridegib and million in milestone payments associated with the initiation of two phase clinical trials in our pik program 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in clinical expenses  an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses and an increase in million in consulting expenses as our hedgehog and pik programs advanced  and million associated with the achievement of milestones for the initiation of two phase clinical trials in our pik program 
these increases were partially offset by an upfront fee of million to license our pik program  which was recorded as research and development expense during the year ended december  we began to track and accumulate costs by major program starting on january  the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the last three years and cumulatively from january  to december  these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  process development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies  clinical trial costs and allocated costs of facilities 
from august through december  our hsp inhibitor program was conducted in collaboration with medimmune  a division of astrazeneca plc  or medimmune  and from august through november  our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program was conducted in collaboration with medimmune 
under this collaboration  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune 
pursuant to our cost sharing arrangement  reimbursable amounts from medimmune were credited to research and development expense  and the expenses for the hsp inhibitor and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs below include credits of approximately million in years prior to program year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  january  to december  in millions pik inhibitor hsp chaperone inhibitor hedgehog pathway inhibitor faah inhibitor includes an upfront license fee of million in  million in development milestones in  as well as million recorded as fair value for the release payment for the amended and restated millennium agreement and million in development milestones in we expect expenses related to our pik program to increase as we continue clinical development of ipi we expect expenses related to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program to decrease significantly as a result of the discontinuation of company sponsored development 
we do not believe that the historical costs associated 
table of contents with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs nor represent what any other future drug development program we initiate may cost 
due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a product candidate and uncertainties related to cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs  the completion dates of these programs  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence  if at all  from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates 
there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop any product candidates 
these risks include the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials that we are currently running or may commence in the future  the scope and rate of progress of our preclinical studies and other research and development activities  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our programs under development  the terms and timing of any strategic alliance  licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our programs under development  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical supplies of any product candidates  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in stock based compensation expense  an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development  and an increase of million in legal expenses primarily related to corporate development activities 
the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development and corporate development activities  and an increase of million in patent expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which is primarily related to the transition of our then executive chair to a non employee position during 
table of contents gain on termination of purdue entities alliance the gain on termination of the purdue entities alliance is non recurring and due to the termination agreements 
interest expense interest expense was comparable for the years ended december   and we expect interest expense in to be lower than in primarily due to the extinguishment of the long term debt due to the purdue entities on september  interest and investment income interest and investment income increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher average cash and investment balance 
interest and investment income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower yields on our cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
income from massachusetts tax incentive award during the year ended december   we recognized million as other income 
we were awarded a tax grant from the commonwealth of massachusetts for approximately million for the year ended december   which is earned over a five year period based on headcount growth 
we achieved the headcount growth required by the award for the first two years and therefore recognized a pro rata portion of the grant 
as the amount received for the award is not related to our ordinary course of operations  we have recorded the amount as other income 
as we did not achieve the headcount growth as of december   we have refunded in the remaining million to the commonwealth of massachusetts 
income from therapeutic discovery grants during the year ended december   we received tax grants aggregating million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project program for qualified expenses related to our hedgehog  hsp and faah programs 
income tax benefit during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million because an uncertain tax position we took in a prior year was no longer subject to examination due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest on investments  up front license fees  expense reimbursement  milestones and cost sharing under our collaborations and debt to fund our operations 
our available for sale debt securities primarily trade in liquid markets  and the average days to maturity of our portfolio  as of december   is less than six months 
because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 

table of contents our significant capital resources are as follows december  december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities working capital years ended december  in thousands cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above financing activities cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all periods presented was related to our research and development programs 
on july   we  mundipharma  and purdue mutually agreed to terminate our strategic alliance agreements  and as a result  mundipharma discontinued all research and development funding thereafter 
during the years ended december   and  we received research and development funding from mundipharma and purdue totaling million  million and million  respectively 
our research and development costs exceeded the funding from mundipharma and purdue for the years ended december  and due primarily to investments we made in our hedgehog and pik programs 
we expect our cash flow used in operating activities to increase in future periods as a result of the termination of the strategic alliance agreements with mundipharma and purdue 
however  our cash flow used in operating activities in future periods may vary significantly due to various factors  including potential cash inflows from future collaboration agreements and potential cash outflows for licensing new programs from third parties 
our cash flow used in operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased primarily due to a decrease in research and development funding from mundipharma and purdue 
our cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included a decrease in deferred revenue from the termination of the strategic alliance agreements 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in research and development expense related to the fair value of a release payment of million  payable in installments  relating to the amended and restated agreement with millennium 
we paid million of this million release payment during the year ended december  and recorded million in due to millennium 
during the year ended december   we paid millennium million associated with the achievement of a milestone under the original agreement with millennium and million associated with the achievement of a milestone under our amended and restated agreement with millennium  which we recorded as research and development expense 
during the year ended december   we paid millennium million associated with the achievement of milestones under the original agreement  which we recorded as research and development expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in research and development expense related to the up front license fee for our pik program 
during the year ended december   we paid million of this million fee and recorded the remaining million in accrued liabilities 
we paid the remaining million license fee during the year ended december  our investing activities for the years ended december   and included the purchase of and proceeds from maturities and sales of available for sale securities and purchases of property and equipment 
our investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of 
table of contents available for sale securities  proceeds of million from maturities of available for sale securities and proceeds of million from sales of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  of million primarily consisted of laboratory equipment and software 
our financing activities for the year ended december  included million of net proceeds from two public stock offerings  million of proceeds from issuance of common stock to pplp as a result of termination of strategic agreements with mundipharma and purdue and million of proceeds from issuances of common stock from stock option exercises related to stock incentive plans 
our financing activities for the year ended december  includes borrowings of million on the line of credit made available to us by pplp 
on september   upon completion of the sale and issuance of common stock to pplp under the securities purchase agreement  the line of credit agreement with pplp terminated in its entirety we will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations 
in the absence of additional funding or business development activities and based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash and investments are sufficient to fund our planned operations into we may  however  seek to raise additional funds before that date for other reasons  including if our product candidates require more extensive clinical or preclinical testing than we currently expect  we advance our product candidates into clinical trials for more indications than we currently expect  we advance more of our product candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials  we advance more preclinical product candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our product candidates is higher than anticipated  we are required  or consider it advisable  to acquire or license intellectual property rights from one or more third parties  or we experience a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons 
historically  we have relied on our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue for a significant portion of our research and development funding needs 
mundipharma and purdue provided us approximately million in research and development funding during the term of our strategic alliance 
following the termination of the strategic alliance agreements with mundipharma and purdue on july   we no longer receive funding from mundipharma or purdue and must use other resources available to us to fund our research and development expenses 
our efforts to raise sufficient capital to replace the funding we previously received under the terminated strategic alliance agreements may not be successful 
during the year ended december   we received million of net proceeds from our public stock offerings 
we may continue to seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity or debt securities  but such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  the terms of our financings may be dilutive to  or otherwise adversely affect  holders of our common stock  and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt 
we may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties  or through project financing 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or product candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our product candidate development programs or to scale back  suspend or terminate our business operations 
organizational restructuring in june  we voluntarily stopped all company sponsored clinical trials of saridegib  and in july  we restructured our strategic alliance agreements with mundipharma and purdue such that we are no longer entitled to research and development funding 
as a result  we implemented work force reductions totaling of 
table of contents our employee headcount as of december  our work force reductions resulted in restructuring charges totaling million related to severance  benefits and related costs for employees and was recorded in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  we expect all payments to be complete by the third quarter of  and we expect to realize cost savings from this restructuring activity during contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations  excluding contingent milestone payments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond software contract obligation due to millennium operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations the above table does not include contracts with contract research organizations as they are generally cancellable  with notice  at our option 
in addition  we have obligations to make milestone payments under our license agreement with millennium 
for a description of these obligations  please see our description of our license agreement with millennium under the heading strategic alliances millennium above 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  corporate obligations  and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december   as compared to an approximately million decrease as of december  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
