when used in this report  the words may  would  should  could  expects  aims  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  projects  potential  or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology are included to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include but are not limited to statements regarding our ability to successfully launch vascepa in the united states for use in the marine indication  the progress and timing of our clinical programs  the potential for  and timing of  regulatory approval of additional indications for vascepa and the next steps we may take thereto  the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  the goals of our development activities  the scope of our intellectual property protection  estimates of the potential markets for our product candidates  estimates of the capacity of manufacturing and other facilities to support our products  our operating and growth strategies  our sales and marketing strategies  our industry  our projected cash needs  liquidity and capital resources and our expected future revenues  operations and expenditures 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions and many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements 
you should review carefully the factors identified in this report in item a  risk factors 
we disclaim any intent to update or announce revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect actual events or developments  except as required by law 
except as otherwise indicated herein  all dates referred to in this report represent periods or dates fixed with reference to our fiscal year ended december overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular health 
on july   we received approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to market and sell our lead product vascepa icosapent ethyl capsules formerly known as amr as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride  or tg  levels in adult patients with severe tg mg dl hypertriglyceridemia  which we sometimes refer to as the marine indication 
triglycerides are fats in the blood 
on january   we commenced our commercial launch of vascepa in the united states for the marine indication 
we are also developing vascepa for the treatment of patients with high tg mg dl and mg dl triglyceride levels who are also on statin therapy for elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol  or ldl c  levels which we refer to as mixed dyslipidemia 
we refer to this second proposed indication for vascepa as the anchor indication 
in late february  we submitted an snda for the anchor indication with the fda 
if our snda is accepted by the fda  assuming a ten month fda review period  we expect the fda to assign a pdufa action date which is not later than the end of in december  we announced commencement of patient dosing in our cardiovascular outcomes study of vascepa  titled reduce it reduction of cardiovascular events with epa intervention trial  which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of vascepa in reducing major cardiovascular events in a high risk patient population on statin therapy 
based on communications with the fda  we believe that we are required to be substantially underway with a cardiovascular outcomes study at the time of the submission of our snda seeking approval of the anchor indication 
we believe that we achieved this requirement prior to submitting the snda 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with our assessment or that they will accept our snda for the anchor indication 
we do not believe the final results of the reduce it study will be required for fda approval of vascepa for the anchor indication 
hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream 
it is estimated that over million adults in the united states have elevated triglyceride levels mg dl and approximately million people in the united states have severely high tg mg dl triglyceride levels  commonly known as very high triglyceride levels 
according to the american heart association scientific statement on triglycerides and cardiovascular disease  
table of contents triglycerides also provide important information as a marker associated with the risk for heart disease and stroke  especially when an individual also has low high density lipoprotein  or hdl c often referred to as good cholesterol  and elevated levels of ldl c often referred to as bad cholesterol 
guidelines for the management of very high triglyceride levels suggest that reducing triglyceride levels is the primary goal in patients to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis 
the effect of vascepa on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity  or the risk for pancreatitis  in patients with hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined 
the potential efficacy and safety of vascepa was studied in two phase clinical trials  the marine trial and the anchor trial 
at a daily dose of grams of vascepa  the dose at which vascepa is fda approved  these trials showed favorable clinical results in their respective patient populations in reducing triglyceride levels without increasing ldl c levels in the marine trial and with a statistically significant decrease in ldl c levels in the anchor trial 
these trials also showed favorable results  particularly with the gram dose of vascepa  in other important lipid and inflammation biomarkers  including apolipoprotein b apo b  non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c  total cholesterol tc  very low density lipoprotein cholesterol  vldl c  lipoprotein associated phospholipase a lp pla  and high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp 
in these trials  the most commonly reported adverse reaction incidence and greater than placebo in vascepa treated patients was arthralgia joint pain for vascepa vs 
for placebo 
commercialization strategy vascepa became commercially available in the united states by prescription in january when we commenced sales and shipments to our network of us based wholesalers 
on january   we commenced our full commercial launch of vascepa in the united states for use in the marine indication 
in preparation for our commercial launch  we recently hired and trained a direct sales force of approximately sales representatives 
we also employ various marketing and medical affairs personnel to support our commercialization of vascepa 
our clinical and commercial supply is provided to us under agreements with various third party suppliers 
as of the date of this annual report  we have announced that patent applications in the united states have been either issued or allowed and more than additional patent applications are pending in the united states 
we are also pursuing patent applications related to vascepa in multiple jurisdictions outside the united states 
these patent applications are part of our strategy to protect the commercial potential of vascepa  which generally includes obtaining and maintaining intellectual property rights  maintaining trade secrets  seeking regulatory exclusivity and taking advantage of manufacturing barriers to entry 
we believe that our sales and marketing team is well positioned to support the commercialization of vascepa for the marine indication and that a larger sales effort will be required to best support the commercialization of vascepa for the anchor indication  assuming fda approval of the anchor indication 
to support the continued commercialization of vascepa  we intend to consider strategic opportunities with larger pharmaceutical companies 
from time to time we have held discussions with larger pharmaceutical companies on potential collaborations and other strategic opportunities  and we intend to continue having discussions regarding such opportunities in the future 
these strategic opportunities may include licensing or similar transactions  joint ventures  partnerships  strategic alliances  business associations  or a sale of the company 
however  we cannot estimate the timing of any such potential strategic transaction  and no assurance can be given that we will enter into any such strategic transaction 
until such time when we enter into such a strategic transaction  if ever  we plan to continue to execute on our plans to market and sell vascepa on our own 
the us market is currently the primary focus for vascepa 
opportunities to market and sell vascepa outside of the united states are also under evaluation 
prior to commencing our us commercial launch of vascepa in january  we had no revenue from vascepa 
as of the date of this annual report  we do not believe that we can provide a reasonably accurate forecast of vascepa revenues and we provide no guidance regarding anticipated levels of vascepa revenues 

table of contents during  we purchased approximately million of vascepa api of which million was capitalized to inventory as of december  and the balance of which was included as a component of research and development expense either because it was received prior to fda approval of vascepa for the marine indication or because it was used in conjunction with the reduce it study 
the majority of this supply was purchased in the second half of we anticipate continuing to make substantial purchases of supply during and beyond 
we anticipate that our gross margin from vascepa sales will be lower in than in subsequent years due to multiple factors  including api supply pricing at our earliest agreed suppliers being currently higher than supply pricing at more recently agreed suppliers  tiered supply pricing at certain suppliers such that cost of supply purchases are scheduled to decline as volume of purchases increase  special initial stocking discounts provided to wholesalers and pharmacies to encourage them to stock vascepa in advance of vascepa s commercial launch  and rebate cards offered to consumers to reduce the size of their co payment requirements while we work with payors to migrate vascepa coverage from tier to tier in these payors drug pricing systems 
financial position we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of million at december  is sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least the next twelve months  including commercialization of vascepa for the marine indication  preparations for commercialization of vascepa for the anchor indication and the advancement of the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study 
in order to fund our commercialization plans  in particular to fully support the launch  marketing and sale of vascepa in the anchor indication  we will likely need to enter into a strategic collaboration or raise additional capital 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to derivative financial liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial liabilities derivative financial liabilities on initial recognition are recorded at fair value 
they are subsequently held at fair value  with gains and losses arising for changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of derivative financial liabilities is determined using valuation techniques  typically we use the black scholes option pricing model 
we use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date 
fluctuations in the assumptions used in the valuation model would result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrant derivative laibility reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
if we issue shares to discharge the liability  the derivative financial liability is derecognized and common stock and additional paid in capital are recognized on the issuance of those shares 
for options and warrants treated as derivative financial liabilities  at settlement date the carrying value of the options and warrants are transferred to equity 
the cash proceeds received from shareholders for additional shares are recorded in common stock and additional paid in capital 
we recorded a financial derivative related the change in control provision associated with our december debt financing 
the fair value of this derivative could fluctuate based on changes the assumptions used in the valuation model 

table of contents inventory capitalization prior to july   when we received approval from the fda to market and sell vascepa in the us for the marine indication  vascepa was considered a product candidate under development 
all supply of vascepa purchased prior to july  was not capitalized and instead charged as a component of research and development expense in the current period 
after vascepa was approved  we began to capitalize inventory purchased from the supplier approved in the nda 
we have three additional supply agreements with basf  chemport and slanmhor  and are working to pursue fda approval for these suppliers to manufacture vascepa api 
until an additional api supplier is approved  all vascepa api purchased from such supplier is included as a component of research and development expense 
upon snda approval of these additional suppliers  we plan to capitalize subsequent vascepa purchases from these suppliers as inventory 
purchases of vascepa received and expensed before such regulatory approvals will not be subsequently capitalized  and all such purchases will be quarantined and not used for commercial supply until such time as the snda for the supplier that produced the api is approved 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation on operations has been minimal during the past three years 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  versus december  revenue 
we recorded no revenue in or research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below research and development expenses non cash stock based compensation expense research and development expense  excluding non cash charges for stock compensation  for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million  or 
the increase in research and development expense was due to increased costs in for our vascepa cardiovascular program  primarily increased clinical costs for the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study  costs of supply purchases prior to nda approval and costs associated with study of amr prior to fda approval of vascepa on july   all supply purchases of vascepa were expensed to research and development 
after fda approval  supply purchases of vascepa were capitalized  with the exception of clinical trial material which continues to be expensed to research and development 
during the year ended december   non capitalized supply purchases and vendor qualification costs were approximately million 
during the year ended december   expenses incurred through our cro for the reduce it study were approximately million 
non cash stock based compensation expense included within research and development was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents in december  we announced that the first patient was dosed in the reduce it study 
during  as planned  we expanded the reduce it study to include clinical sites in multiple countries  activated clinical sites and enrolled patients 
we believe that the patient enrollment phase of the reduce it study will be the most expensive phase of the study 
we anticipate that reduce it study costs will continue to increase in as we seek to continue to enroll patients while also continuing our study of patients who were previously enrolled 
during  we anticipate incurring expense through our cro in connection with this trial of between million and million 
the amount charged to research and development expense in for supply related purchases cannot be reasonably predicted as it depends on the timing of supply shipped to us from basf  chemport and slanmhor and the timing of fda approval of the these suppliers and their facilities with respect to vascepa production 
we anticipate placing supply purchase orders with these suppliers prior to fda approval of their facilities provided that we are satisfied that the supply is produced in an appropriate cgmp environment and conforms to our vascepa product specifications 
all such purchases will be quarantined and not used for commercial supply until such time as the snda for the applicable supplier that produced the api is approved 
after these api suppliers are approved  supply purchases from them will be capitalized as a component of inventory 
we may also increase research and development costs in related to amr the amount and timing of amr development costs depends on the results of the amr study commenced in  which results have not completed evaluation 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below marketing  general and administrative expenses non cash warrant related compensation income expense non cash stock based compensation expense marketing  general and administrative expense  excluding non cash charges for stock and warrant compensation  for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to cost increases in for marketing research activities  medical education approximately million and higher staffing levels and related travel approximately million plus increased facility costs and other general and administrative costs incurred in order to prepare for the commercialization of vascepa 
non cash warrant related compensation expense income for the year ended december  was million of expense  versus million of income in the prior year 
warrant related compensation expense for the period ended december  reflects non cash income for the change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability associated with warrants issued in october to three former officers of amarin  net of warrants exercised 
the expense in was due primarily to the increase in the fair value of these warrants  the increase in the fair value of the warrants is due primarily to an increase in our stock price between december  and december  we anticipate that the value of this warrant derivative liability may increase or decrease from period to period based upon changes in the price of our common stock 
such non cash changes in valuation could be significant as the history of our stock price has been volatile 
the gain or loss resulting from such non cash changes in valuation could have a material impact on our reported net income or loss from period to period 
in particular  if the price of our stock increases  the change in valuation of this warrant derivative liability will add to our history of operating losses 
non cash stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million due primarily reflects an increase in the number of awards outstanding during the year versus the prior period  and also in the fair value of new option awards granted to attract and retain qualified employees 

table of contents we expect marketing  general and administrative costs in to increase 
in late and early  we hired approximately sales representatives plus district managers to support our january full launch of vascepa for the marine indication 
the cost of this sales team will increase our costs in in addition  we intend to support the commercialization of vascepa with expanded medical education programs  various forms of promotion  continued market research and further infrastructure and systems 
loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
loss on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended december  was million versus million in the prior year period 
loss on change in fair value of derivative liability is primarily related to the change in fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with the october private placement 
in october we issued million warrants at an exercise price of and recorded a million warrant derivative liability  representing the fair value of the warrants issued 
as these warrants have been classified as a derivative liability  they are revalued at each reporting period  with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability at december  was million and we recognized a million loss on change in fair value of derivative liability for the period ended december  for these warrants 
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability at december  was million and we recognized a million loss on change in fair value of derivative liability for the period ended december  the decrease in the warrant derivative liability value was due primarily to the exercises of warrants 
upon exercise  the fair value of warrants exercised is remeasured and reclassified from warrant liability to additional paid in capital 
the fair value of the long term debt redemption feature at december  was million 
the company recognized a million gain on change in fair value of derivative liability at december  see further discussion of the warrant derivative liability in note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense  net 
interest income includes interest earned on cash balances 
interest expense includes the amortization of the exchange option related to our exchangeable debt  the amortization of debt discounts and debt obligation coupon interest 
during the twelve months ended december   we recognized interest expense of million  of which million represents amortization of the debt discount  million represents contractual coupon interest  million represents the amortization of the discount from underwriter discounts and offering costs 
other expense income  net 
other income primarily includes unrealized loss due to the fluctuation in the exchange rate of a milestone payment in the amount of million between the date that this obligation was incurred on july  and the date that it was paid later in also included are gains and losses on other foreign exchange transactions

the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to decreased costs in for our vascepa cardiovascular program  primarily costs associated with the marine and anchor trials  our two phase clinical trials  the top line results of which were reported in december and april  respectively 
the decrease in costs for these trials in versus were partially offset by increased clinical costs for the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study  which was initiated in the second half of  and costs associated with submitting our nda in september for vascepa

liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity as of december  include cash and cash equivalents of million 
our projected uses of cash include commercialization of vascepa for the marine indication  preparations for commercialization of vascepa for the anchor indication  the continued funding of the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study  working capital and other general corporate activities 
our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in millions years ended december  cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents on december  the company entered into an agreement with biopharma secured debt fund ii holdings cayman lp biopharma 
under this agreement  the company granted to biopharma a security interest in future receivables and all related rights to vascepa  in exchange for million received at the closing of the agreement which closing occurred in december the company has agreed to repay 
table of contents biopharma up to million of future revenue and receivables 
the first repayment under the agreement is a repayment of million of interest due to biopharma in november  subject to the limitation described below 
additional quarterly repayments are due thereafter in accordance with the following schedule million of interest in the first quarter of  million per quarter in each of the next four quarters  million per quarter in each of the next four quarters  million per quarter in each of the next four quarters and a final payment of million due in may the quarterly repayments through the third quarter of september represent interest only 
quarterly payments do not begin to reduce the principal balance until the fourth quarter of these quarterly payments are subject to a quarterly threshold amount whereby  if a calculated threshold  based on quarterly vascepa revenues  is not achieved  the quarterly payment payable in that quarter can at our election be reduced and with the reduction carried forward without interest for payment in a future period 
payment of such carried forward amounts are subject to similarly calculated threshold repayment amounts based on vascepa revenue levels 
except upon a change of control in amarin  the agreement does not expire until million has been repaid 
under the agreement  upon a change of control  we would be required to pay million  less any previously repaid amount  if the change of control occurs on or before december   or required to repay million  less any previously repaid amount  if the change of control event occurs after december  the company can prepay after october   an amount equal to million less any previously repaid amount 
on january   amarin  through its wholly owned subsidiary corsicanto limited  a private limited company incorporated under the laws of ireland  completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of its exchangeable senior notes due the notes are the senior unsecured obligations of corsicanto limited and are guaranteed by amarin 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning on july  in july amarin made its initial interest payments on the notes in the aggregate amount of million 
the notes mature on january   unless earlier repurchased  redeemed or exchanged 
on or after january   we may elect to redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on each of january   january  and january   the holders of the notes may require that we repurchase in cash the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
at any time prior to january   upon certain circumstances  which circumstances include our issuing a notice of redemption to the note holders  the price of amarin shares trading above of the exchange price  or certain other events defined in the note agreement  the holders of the notes may elect to convert the notes 
the exchange rate for conversion is adss per  principal amount of the notes equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately per ads  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  including adjustment if we pay cash dividends 
upon exchange  the notes may be settled  at amarin s election  subject to certain conditions  in cash  adss or a combination of cash and adss 
it is the company s current intention to settle these obligations in cash 
in january  we sold million shares of our common shares  par value per share  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions and expenses payable by us associated with this transaction 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of million at december  is sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least the next twelve months  including commercialization of vascepa for the marine indication  preparations for commercialization of vascepa for the anchor indication and the advancement of the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study 
in order to fund our commercialization plans  in particular to fully support the launch  marketing and sale of vascepa in the anchor indication  we will likely need to enter into a strategic collaboration or raise additional capital

the above table does not reflect the repayment of the million notes as they may be exchanged for adrs 
represents principle and interest payments which we anticipate paying under the terms of the agreement entered into with biopharma secured debt fund ii holdings cayman lp biopharma 
under this agreement  the company granted to biopharma a security interest in future receivables and all rights to vascepa  in exchange for million received at the closing of the agreement which closing occurred in december the company has agreed to repay biopharma up to million of future revenue and receivables 
the first repayment under the agreement is a payment of million of interest due to biopharma in november  subject to the limitation described below

the table above reflects payment in full of the scheduled quarterly amounts with such potential elected reductions 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the above table also does not reflect potential material purchases under the api supply agreements with basf  chemport or the consortium led by slanmhor 
these api supply agreements provide access to additional api supply that is incremental to supply from nisshin pharma  our existing fda approved api supplier 
each of these additional api agreements contemplates a phased capacity expansion plan aimed at creating sufficient capacity to meet anticipated demand for api material for vascepa following commercial launch 
these api suppliers are self funding these expansion plans with contributions from amarin 
these agreements include requirements for the suppliers to qualify their materials and facilities 
we anticipate incurring certain costs associated with the qualification of product produced by these suppliers 
these agreements include annual 
table of contents purchase levels enabling amarin to maintain supply exclusivity with each respective supplier  and to prevent potential termination of the agreements 
these minimum purchase levels do not contractually begin until the applicable supplemental nda  or snda  for the supplier is approved by the fda  if ever  and upon the achievement of manufacturing capacity expansion 
accordingly  these amounts are excluded from the above table 
the two supply agreements entered into in  the agreements with basf and chemport  also include i development fees up to a maximum of million  ii material commitments of up to million for initial raw materials  which will be credited against future api purchases  and is refundable to us if a supplier does not successfully develop and qualify the api by a certain date and iii a raw material purchase commitment of million 
under these agreements  during we purchased million of vascepa api from chemport and made advance payments of million for api from basf 
the agreement with the fourth api supplier  when all contingencies are eliminated by the supplier  provides for development fees of up to million and a commitment of up to million  which will be credited against future api material purchases 
under this agreement  during we made payments of million to slanhmor related to stability and technical batches and advances on future api purchases 
concurrent with our supply agreements with chemport entered into in for the supply of api materials for vascepa  we agreed to make a noncontrolling minority share equity investment in the supplier of up to million 
the company invested million under this agreement in july and the remaining million during these amounts have been included in other long term assets and accounted for under the cost method at december  under the share repurchase agreement with laxdale limited  or laxdale  upon receipt of marketing approval in the us and or europe for the first indication for vascepa or first indication of any product containing amarin neuroscience intellectual property acquired from laxdale in  the company must make an aggregate stock or cash payment to the former shareholders of laxdale at the sole option of each of the sellers of million approximately million at december  for each of the two potential marketing approvals

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  changes in credit worthiness and liquidity of our marketable securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  and prior to we entered into no foreign exchange contracts 
our investments meet high credit quality and diversification standards  as specified in our investment policy 
at december   we record as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock issued to investors 
the fair value of this warrant liability is determined using the black scholes option valuation model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the market price of our common shares based on the market price of our stock at december  on which the december  valuation was based  the value of the derivative liability would have increased by million 
such increase would have been reflected as additional loss on change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability in our statement of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the euro  sterling and yen 
the majority of cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our vendor relationships are denominated in us dollar 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
from time to time  we maintain a small amount of our cash in cash equivalents in euro and pound sterling 
we purchase supply from nisshin in japanese yen 
as our level of supply purchases from nisshin have increased  we in have begun to enter into short term forward currency pricing contracts to lock in the exchange rate on a portion of our anticipated purchases denominated in japanese yen 
interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not exposed to significant interest rate risk through market value fluctuations of balance sheet items ie  price risk or through changes in interest income or expenses ie  re financing or re investment risk 
interest rate risk mainly arises through interest bearing liabilities and assets 
we invest funds not needed for near term operating expenses in diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of december   the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents maturing in one year or less was million and represented of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our securities due to the general short term nature of our investment portfolio
