overview our company resulted from the merger of corporate road show 
com inc  a new york corporation incorporated in november  cprd  and rexahn  corp  a maryland corporation  immediately after giving effect to our reincorporation as a delaware corporation under the name rexahn pharmaceuticals  inc in connection with that transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into rexahn  corp  with rexahn  corp remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
in exchange for their shares of capital stock in rexahn  corp  the former stockholders of rexahn  corp received shares of common stock representing approximately of the company s outstanding equity after giving effect to the transaction 
further  upon the effective time of the merger  our historic business was abandoned and the business plan of rexahn  corp was adopted 
the transaction was therefore accounted for as a reverse acquisition with rexahn  corp as the accounting acquiring party and cprd as the acquired party 
in september  rexahn  corp was merged with and into the company 
our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our pharmaceutical technologies  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product sales until we receive approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our pharmaceutical candidates 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private financings  primarily private sales of common stock and debt securities  and collaboration agreements with our strategic investors 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies are in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and their basis of application is consistent with that of the previous year 
our significant estimates include assumptions made in estimating the fair values of stock based compensation and our assessment relating to the impairment of intangible assets and deferred revenues 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of third party service costs under research and development agreements  salaries and related personnel costs  as well as stock compensation related to these costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 

table of contents costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage that have no alternative future uses and are for unapproved product compounds are expensed as incurred 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements for cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these financial instruments 
the fair value methodology for our warrant liabilities  put feature on common stock  and marketable securities is described in detail in item of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
asc deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates 
asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all portions of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods and existing contracts that will result in future profits 
income tax expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period  increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
as a result of the company s significant cumulative losses  we determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe that as a result of our losses sustained to date  any examination would result in a reduction of our net operating loss carryforward rather than a tax liability 
as such  we have not provided for additional taxes estimated under asc warrant liabilities in accordance with asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity  we record warrant liabilities at fair value due to provisions in our warrant agreements  as discussed in footnote of item of this form k 
we reevaluate the fair value of our warrants at each reporting period  and changes in the fair value between reporting periods is recorded as unrealized gain on fair value of warrants in the statement of operations 
put feature on common stock we extended anti dilution protection provisions on our common stock to our investors in our december and march financings  whereby in the event that we sell or issue shares below the effective purchase price paid  the investors would thereupon receive additional shares in a ratio outlined in the securities purchase agreement 
in accordance with asc  this feature is a written put on our common stock  and is classified as a liability at fair value 
we reevaluate the fair value at each reporting period  and changes in the fair value are recorded as unrealized gain on put feature on common stock in the statement of operations 
the anti dilution provisions expired in december  and march  
table of contents stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including employee stock options  areto be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  the company adheres to the guidance set forth within sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding the interaction between asc and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides interpretations with respect to the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
if there are indications of impairment  the company uses future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded asset values  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
management determined that an impairment of intangible assets occurred in and wrote off the assets remaining carrying value of  concentration of credit risk asc  financial instruments  requires disclosure of any significant off balance sheet risk and credit risk concentration 
the company does not have significant off balance sheet risk or credit concentration 
the company maintains cash and short term investments with major financial institutions 
from time to time the company has funds on deposit with commercial banks that exceed federally insured limits 
the balances are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to  at december   the company s uninsured cash balance was  management does not consider this to be a significant credit risk as the banks are large  established financial institutions 
recent accounting pronouncements affecting the company fair value measurements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update to accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc which amends the disclosure requirements for fair value instruments 
the new disclosures required include disclosure regarding the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs  and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs 
the guidance is effective for the company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  the company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for presentation and disclosure of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
under the new guidance  a company may no longer present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in the statement of stockholder s equity  and instead must present the components of comprehensive income either in the statement of operations or in a separate statement immediately following the statement of operations 
in addition  reclassification adjustments between comprehensive income and net income must be disclosed on the financial statements 
this guidance is effective for the company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  the company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 
table of contents in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update  comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  to improve the transparency of reporting reclassifications from comprehensive income to net income 
the new amendments require that a company must present the effects on line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  and additional referencing and disclosure regarding these items 
the guidance is effective for the company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and the year ended december  total revenues the company had no revenues for the years ended december  or general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including business development  investor relations  and general legal activities 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to stock option compensation 
there were a large number of options that fully vested in  which resulted in expense in but not in during the year ended december  we reduced investor relations activities by consolidating our investor relations activities to one provider 
in addition  the year ended december  had greater professional fees related to the restatement of our financial statements due to reclassifying our warrants and put feature on common stock from equity to liabilities for the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our drug candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the costs associated with the serdaxin phase iib trial  where we incurred approximately  for the year ended december  in addition  we incurred less costs for rx in compared to due to drug manufacturing costs in that were used for the exploratory phase i clinical trial 

table of contents patent fees our patent fees decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to legal costs to respond to the office actions on pending patent applications  and translation fees associated with regionalizing patents in foreign jurisdictions for the year ended december   but did not occur in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to fully depreciated assets for which we incurred depreciation in but not in interest income interest income decreased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a decrease in interest rates and interest bearing investments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  unrealized gain on fair value of warrants our warrants are recorded as liabilities at fair value  and the warrants are valued using a lattice model 
changes in the fair value of warrants are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in our statement of operations 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded an unrealized gain on the fair value of our warrants of  and  the change in the fair value of our warrants is a non cash item reflected in our financial statements 
net loss as a result of the above  net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the year ended december  
table of contents research and development projects research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage and have no alternative future uses are expensed as incurred 
our research and development programs are related to our oncology clinical stage drug candidates  archexin  rx and rx  our cns candidates serdaxin and zoraxel and pre clinical stage drug candidates  rx nano  rx nano  and rx each of our drug candidates is in various stages of completion as described below 
as we expand our clinical studies  we will enter into additional development agreements 
significant additional expenditures will be required if we complete our clinical trials  start new trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  expand our operations and bring our products to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of uncertainties such as trial design  the length of the trial  the number of clinical sites and the number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
because the successful development of our most advanced drug candidates  archexin  rx  rx  serdaxin and zoraxel  is uncertain  and because  rx nano  rx nano  and rx are in early stage development  we are unable to estimate the costs of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows could commence from the sale of these drug candidates 
if these projects are not completed as planned  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 
the table below summarizes the amounts spent on each of our research and development projects through december  cumulative from march  inception to december  clinical candidates archexin rx rx serdaxin zoraxel preclinical compounds total 
table of contents archexin archexin is a nucleotide single stranded dna anti sense molecule  which is a first in class inhibitor of the protein kinase akt 
akt plays critical roles in cancer cell proliferation  survival  angiogenesis  metastasis  and drug resistance 
archexin received orphan drug designation from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for five cancer indications renal cell carcinoma  or rcc  glioblastoma  ovarian cancer  stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer 
the fda orphan drug program provides seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval and tax incentives for clinical research 
in august   we announced top line results of our phase iia clinical trial 
the open label stage study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of archexin in combination with gemcitabine 
stage was the dose finding portion and stage was the dose expansion portion using the dose identified in stage to be administered with gemcitabine 
the study enrolled subjects aged with metastatic pancreatic cancer at nine centers in the united states and india 
the primary endpoint was overall survival following four cycles of therapy with a six month follow up 
for those evaluable patients  the study demonstrated that treatment with archexin in combination with gemcitabine provided a median survival rate of months compared to the historical survival data of months for standard single agent gemcitabine therapy 
the most frequent reported adverse events were constipation  nausea  abdominal pain and pyrexia  regardless of relatedness 
rexahn is evaluating options for advancing archexin  including initiating phase iia clinical trials for chemo resistant solid tumors and hematological malignancies in the second half of we own one issued us patent for archexin 
as of december   we have spent approximately  for the development of archexin 
the trial was completed in the third quarter of  and we estimate that we have approximately an additional  of costs yet to be billed by vendors for this trial 
we currently estimate that additional phase ii trials for archexin will cost approximately  rx in  we closed on the relo and a purchase agreement with teva for the development of our novel anti cancer compound  rx rx is a small molecule  new chemical entity nucleoside compound that has an anti metabolite mechanism of action  and has therapeutic potential in a broad range of cancers including colon  lung  and pancreatic cancer 
the investment by teva is restricted to supporting the research and development program for the development of rx we will be eligible to receive royalties on net sales of rx worldwide 
on january   we entered into a second amendment to the purchase agreement  whereby teva purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
this second amendment also provided for a possible third investment by teva  in the amount of  this compound entered into an exploratory phase i clinical study during the first quarter of the primary objective of the study was to determine oral bioavailability of rx in humans 
on august   we released the results that the study demonstrated the oral bioavailability of rx in humans  and with no adverse events reported in the study 
on december   teva exercised the third investment option  which constituted the final closing of the purchase agreement  and we issued  shares for  on december  we received  from teva pursuant to a second amendment to the relo for the further development of rx the costs of the exploratory phase i clinical study were approximately  as of december   we have incurred approximately  for the development of rx we anticipate that rx will enter a phase i clinical trial in the second half of 
table of contents rx rx is a first in class small molecule that inhibits the phosphorylated p rna helicase  a protein that plays a key role in cancer growth  progression  and metastasis 
in july   we submitted an ind application to the fda for rx as of december   we have incurred approximately  for the development of rx rx may enter phase i clinical trials during the first half of we estimate the costs of the phase i clinical study to be approximately  serdaxin rx serdaxin is an extended release formulation of clavulanic acid  which is an ingredient present in antibiotics approved by the fda 
we developed serdaxin for the treatment of depression and neurodegenerative disorders 
from january to september   we conducted a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study that compared two doses of serdaxin  mg and mg  to placebo over an week treatment period for mdd patients 
on november   we released results that the study showed serdaxin did not demonstrate efficacy compared to a placebo group as measured by the madrs 
all groups showed an approximate point improvement in the protocol defined primary endpoint of madrs  and had a substantial number of patients who demonstrated a meaningful clinical improvement from baseline 
the study showed that serdaxin was safe and well tolerated 
at this point  we are currently not allocating resources to further develop serdaxin to treat mdd and are looking for partners who will fund the clinical development 
through december   the pre clinical and clinical costs incurred for development of serdaxin to date have been approximately  we do not anticipate additional costs for serdaxin 
zoraxel rx zoraxel is an immediate release formulation of clavulanic acid  the same active ingredient found in our product candidate serdaxin 
the phase iia proof of concept  completed with encouraging results  was a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled and dose ranging mg  mg  mg study of erectile dysfunction patients ages of to treated with zoraxel 
the phase iib study is designed to assess zoraxel s efficacy in approximately male subjects  ages to  with ed 
the double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  week study will include iief as the primary endpoint following treatment with zoraxel at and mg doses 
however  given the results of the serdaxin phase iib mdd clinical trial and that zoraxel and serdaxin share a common ingredient  we are currently looking for partners who will fund the clinical development of zoraxel 
through december  the costs incurred for development of zoraxel to date have been approximately  we currently estimate that these phase iib studies would require approximately  but we have not allocated additional resources to the development of zoraxel at this time 
pre clinical pipeline rx nano  rx nano and rx are all in a pre clinical stage of development 
through december   the costs incurred for development of these compounds to date have been approximately  the estimated cost to complete pre clinical toxicology and phase i clinical trials is estimated to be approximately  per each compound 

table of contents the conduct of the clinical trial and toxicology studies described above are being accomplished in conjunction with third party clinical research organizations at external locations 
this business practice is typical for the pharmaceutical industry and companies like us 
as a result  the risk of completion or delay of these studies is not within our direct control and a program delay may occur due to circumstances outside our control 
a delay in any of these programs may not necessarily have a direct impact on our daily operations 
however  to the extent that a delay results in additional cost to us  unexpected expenses may result 
we will need to raise additional money through debt and or equity offerings in order to continue to develop our drug candidates 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional money  we will have to reduce our research and development activities 
we will first reduce research and development activities associated with our preclinical compounds 
to the extent necessary  we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical drugs 
liquidity and capitalresources operating activities cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  the operating cash flows during the year ended december  reflect our net loss of  and a net decrease of cash components of working capital and non cash charges totaling  cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   consisted of  from the sale of marketable securities  and a decrease in restricted cash of  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  consisted of net proceeds of  from the issuance  shares of common stock to investors  and  shares to teva 
the investors were also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  financings we have financed our operations since inception primarily through equity and convertible debt financings and interest income from investments of cash and cash equivalents 
during fiscal year  we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of  the increase resulted from cash provided by financing and investing activities of  and  respectively  offset by cash used in operating activities of  on march   the company closed on a purchase agreement to issue  shares of common stock at a price of per share to an institutional investor for net proceeds of  which includes  of cash stock issuance costs 
the investors were also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  exercisable on or after six months from the date of delivery until the five year anniversary of the date the warrants are exercisable 
there warrants were valued at  and recorded as warrant liabilities 
the closing costs included  warrants  valued at  and  of underwriter s discounts and professional and other fees 

table of contents on december  we closed on an underwritten public offering to issue and sell  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
the common stock and warrants were sold in units  consisting of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock  at a price of per share 
the warrants have an exercise price of per whole share of common stock 
pursuant to the underwriting agreement  we granted the underwriters a day option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock

the closing costs of  included warrants to purchase  shares of common stock issued to the underwriters valued at  and  for underwriter s discounts  and professional and other fees 
for the next months  we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from the net proceeds of equity and debt offerings we may make  cash on hand  licensing fees and grants 
although we expect to have to pursue additional financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure financing when needed or obtain such financing on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  or that any additional funding we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs in the long term 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional money  we will have to reduce our research and development activities 
contractual obligations we have contracted with various vendors to provide research and development services 
the terms of these agreements usually require an initiation fee and monthly or periodic payments over the term of the agreement  ranging from months to months 
the costs to be incurred are estimated and are subject to revision 
as of december   the total contract value of these agreements was approximately  and we made payments totaling  under the terms of the agreements 
all of these agreements may be terminated by either party upon appropriate notice as stipulated in the respective agreements 
on september   we and three of our key executives entered into amended and restated employment agreements 
the amended and restated employment agreements replace the prior employment contracts entered into on august  we entered into the amended and restated employment agreements in order to provide the key executives with i an automatic one year renewal upon the expiration of the initial three year term and upon each consecutive year term unless such employment with the company is terminated earlier by the company or the executives  ii an annual base salary adjustment for inflation as determined by the consumer price index subject to review by the company s compensation committee  iii an increase in the company provided life insurance coverage from an amount equal to two times the executive s annual base salary to an amount equal to four times the executive s annual base salary  and iv a one time cash payment  subject to applicable withholding requirements under applicable state and federal law  in an amount equal to the executive s increased income tax costs as a result of payments made to the executive by the company under the change of control provisions of the amended and restated employment agreement 
other than these changes  the new contracts have substantially similar terms to the executives prior employment agreements 
the agreements result in annual commitments of   and  respectively

the initial license fee was  all of which was paid as of december  the agreement with krict calls for a one time milestone payment of  within days after the first achievement of marketing approval of the first commercial product arising out of or in connection with the use of krict s intellectual properties 
as of december   this milestone has not occurred 
on june   we signed a five year lease for  square feet of office space in rockville  maryland commencing on june  the lease requires annual base rents of  with increases over the next five years 
under the leasing agreement  we pay our allocable portion of real estate taxes and common area operating charges 
we paid  and  for rent under this lease in the years ended december  and  respectively 
future rental payments over the next five years and thereafter are as follows in connection with the lease agreement  we issued a letter of credit of  in favor of the lessor 
we have restricted cash equivalents of the same amount for the letter of credit 
on august  and july   the letter of credit was reduced to  and  respectively  per the lease agreement 
on september   the company closed on the purchase agreement with teva  under which teva purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of this agreement  the parties executed a research and the relo pursuant to which the company agreed to use  from the gross proceeds of the issuance and sale of shares to teva to fund a research and development program for the pre clinical development of rx on january   the company entered into a second amendment to the purchase agreement in which teva purchased  shares of the common stock of the company for gross proceeds of  which the company agreed to use for the further preclinical development of rx on december   teva exercised its option to purchase  of common stock  and we issued teva  shares 
this constituted the third and final closing agreed to in the purchase agreement  and the use of these funds is not restricted 
on december   we received funds from teva in accordance with a second amendment to the relo agreement  entered into on november  in which teva provided us with an additional  of research funding for the development of rx we did not issue equity for this transaction 

table of contents the table below summarizes the investments made under the purchase agreement and relo date of investment investment amount shares issued proceeds remaining in restricted cash as of deferred research and development arrangement balance at total on may   and june   we signed a one year renewal to use lab space commencing on july  and  respectively 
the lease requires monthly rental payments of  rent paid under the lease during the years ended december  and was  we established a k plan for our employees where we match of the first of the employee s deferral plus of an additional of the employee s deferral 
expense related to this matching contribution aggregated  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
current and future financing needs we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our planned product development efforts  our clinical trials  and our research and development efforts 
total cash  including restricted cash  and marketable securities  was  as of december  based on our current plans and our capital resources  we believe that our cash  restricted cash  and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to meet our minimum planned operating needs over the next eighteen months which would entail focusing our resources on phase ii clinical trials of archexin  phase i clinical trials of rx and rx  and the further development of our preclinical pipeline 
over the next twelve months  we expect to spend a minimum of approximately million for phase ii clinical trials of archexin 
we also expect to pay million on the development of rx and rx  million for the development of our preclinical pipeline and general research and development costs  million on general corporate expenses  and approximately  on facilities rent 
these figures include our commitments described earlier under contractual obligations under this item we will need to seek additional financing to implement and fund drug candidate development  clinical trial and research and development efforts to the maximum extent of our operating plan  including in vivo animal and pre clinical studies  clinical trials for new product candidates  as well as other research and development projects 
if we are not able to secure additional financing  we may not be able to implement and fund the research and development 
table of contents however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the progress of our product development activities  the number and scope of our product development programs  the progress of our pre clinical and clinical trial activities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into collaboration agreements  our ability to maintain current collaboration programs and to establish new collaboration arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of regulatory approvals 
impact of inflation to date inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for the year ended december   we are exposed to the following market risks interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments 
at december   our cash was invested primarily in short term bank deposits and municipal obligations  all of which were denominated in us dollars 
due to the conservative nature of these investments  which primarily bear interest at fixed rates  we do not believe we have material exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   we had no debt instruments on our balance sheet 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on contracts with vendors associated outside of the united states 
accordingly changes in the value of the us dollar  relative to other currencies  may have an impact on our financial statements and earnings 
the number and dollar amount of contracts denominated in foreign currency is immaterial  therefore  we believe we do not have material exposure to foreign currency risk
