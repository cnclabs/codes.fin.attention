acquisition of controlling interest in pst eletr nica ltda 
pst as of december   we completed the acquisition of an additional controlling interest in pst 
as a result  we now own of the outstanding equity of pst  which is a brazil based electronics system provider focused on electronic vehicle alarms  convenience accessories  vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in vehicle audio and video devices  primarily for the south american automotive and motorcycle markets 
in exchange for the controlling interest in pst  we paid the sellers million in cash and issued million common shares of the company 
because a controlling interest in pst was not acquired until the close of business on december   the results for the year ended december  were accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting such that our portion of pst s after tax earnings were included within equity in earnings of investees in the statement of operations 
pst s results for the year ended december  were consolidated such that of pst s operations were included in each line from sales through net income in the company s statement of operations with the noncontrolling interest deducted in the net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest line and used to compute our portion of pst s net income loss 
due to the acquisition of controlling interest the company fair valued the assets and liabilities of pst as of december   the depreciation and amortization associated with these purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory  property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangibles have been included in the statement of operations for the year ended december  segments we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this structure  our operations have been reported utilizing the following segments electronics this segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units and driver information systems 
wiring this segment includes results of operations that design electrical power and signal distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors and instrument panel assembly 
control devices this segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture sensors  switches  valves and actuators 
pst this segment includes results of operations that specialize in the design  manufacture and sale of electronic vehicle alarms  convenience accessories  vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in vehicle audio and video devices in south america 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its reportable segments in accordance with the manner in which the company s chief operating decision maker receives and reviews financial information to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
as a result  the company s wiring business unit is its own reporting segment for financial reporting purposes 
historically  the wiring business unit was included in the electronics reporting segment 
the company has revised the consolidated segment information for all periods presented in this annual report on form k to reflect this change in presentation 
overview net income attributable to stoneridge  inc was million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  our diluted earnings per share was benefited by due to an after tax gain on previously held equity interest resulting from the acquisition of controlling interest in pst 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of million over our net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in our net sales was primarily a result of the acquisition of controlling interest in pst which had net sales of million in our net sales were positively affected by increased sales volume in the north american agricultural vehicle market 
sales volumes in the north american automotive vehicle market slightly increased during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   but were more than offset by lower commercial vehicle sales volume of million primarily related to a significant customer 
our net sales in south america were due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in pst such that pst s revenues were consolidated for the year ended december  our decrease in net sales in europe and other was primarily due to decreased sales volume of european automotive vehicle market products and unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately million for the year ended december  our selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase in sg a was primarily due to the consolidation of pst in our results which had sg a expenses of million which included purchase accounting amortization of million and business realignment charges of million 
lower incentive compensation expenses partially offset the increase in sg a expenses for the year ended decernber  when compared to product development expenses included within sg a increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to pst s product development expenses which were million for the year ended december  at december  and december   we maintained cash and cash equivalents balances of million and million  respectively

outlook the north american commercial vehicle market weakened during we expect continued softness in the commercial vehicle market to be offset by an expected increase in sales to a significant customer in that market which will benefit our wiring segment in if actual production is lower than forecasted it will negatively affect our wiring segment 
the improvement in the north american automotive vehicle market had a favorable effect on our control devices segment s results 
north american automotive vehicle production was million units for for  this production volume is forecasted to be in the range of million to million units 
if this forecasted increase in production volume occurs it will favorably affect our control devices segment 
our european commercial vehicle market sales which were flat in are expected to improve during if actual production is lower than forecasted it will negatively affect our electronics segment 
agricultural vehicle sales increased during when compared to  which favorably affected our wiring segment 
we believe that this market will continue to improve during our pst segment revenues are expected to be consistent with and will benefit from an expected modest economic recovery in brazil 
due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve  in the ordinary course of business we face pricing pressures from our customers 
in response to these pricing pressures we have been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of others  the net impact of which has not been material 
however  if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the future to mitigate future pricing pressures  our results of operations may be adversely affected

our future results could be unfavorably affected by increased commodity prices  specifically copper 
copper prices fluctuated during and have continued to fluctuate in we entered into fixed price commodity contracts for a portion of our and copper purchases and have a portion of our sales subject to copper surcharge billings which would mitigate a portion of any raw material cost increases 
our results could also be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
we have significant foreign denominated transaction exposure in certain locations  especially in mexico  sweden and brazil 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to the mexican peso 
we have significant us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss and credit carryforwards to reduce its tax liability 
during the fourth quarter of we undertook a secondary offering 
as a result of the secondary offering a substantial change in our ownership occurred and we experienced an ownership change pursuant to section of the code 
there was no impact to current or deferred income taxes resulting from the ownership change 
at december   we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million  of which million was held domestically and million was held in foreign locations 
our cash balance was not restricted at december  seasonality our electronics  wiring and control devices segments are not typically materially impacted by seasonality  however the demand for our pst segment consumer products is typically higher in the second half of the year  the fourth quarter in particular 
inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity prices  we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on historical authorized returns  at the point of passage of title  which is either at the time of shipment or upon customer receipt based on the terms of the sale 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
there were no such significant instances of this in these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
in certain instances  we may be asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method for our electronics  wiring and control devices segments and average cost method for our pst segment 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we adjust our excess and obsolescence reserve at least on a quarterly basis 
excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for a reasonable period 
we have guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number of months of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
we acquired controlling interest in pst on december  and based on the purchase price in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill was recorded 
our impairment testing performed in concluded that pst s fair value exceeded its carrying value but not by a significant margin primarily due to the short duration since the acquisition date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the estimate for our share based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data  future expectations and the expected term of the share based compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include  among other items  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
these deferred tax assets begin to expire after december  and  respectively 
accounting standards requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including the potential to carryback net operating losses and credits  the future reversal of certain taxable temporary differences  actual and forecasted results  and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible 
risk factors include the us economic conditions affecting the us automotive and commercial vehicle markets of which the company has significant operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result we provided a full valuation allowance  net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences  with respect to our us deferred tax assets 
this conclusion has not changed through to the extent that realization of a portion or all of the tax assets becomes more likely than not to be realized based on changes in circumstances a reversal of that portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recorded 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring new disclosures about reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income 
these disclosures may be presented on the face of the statements or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standards update and revise our disclosure  as required  beginning with the first quarter of in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring new disclosures about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset by or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standards update and revise our disclosure  as required  beginning with the first quarter of recently adopted accounting standards effective january   we adopted an accounting standards update with new guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this standard provides guidance on the application of fair value accounting where it is already required or permitted by other standards 
this standard also requires additional disclosures related to transfers of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy and quantitative and qualitative disclosures related to significant unobservable inputs 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted accounting standards updates with guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income 
these standards require an entity to either present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
accordingly  we have presented net income and other comprehensive income in two consecutive statements 
forward looking statements portions of this report on form k contain forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company  with respect to  among other things  our i future product and facility expansion  ii acquisition strategy  iii investments and new product development  iv growth opportunities related to awarded business and v operation expectations 
forward looking statements may be identified by the words will  may  should  designed to  believes  plans  projects  intends  expects  estimates  anticipates  continue  and similar words and expressions 
the forward looking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include  among other factors the reduced purchases  loss or bankruptcy of a major customer  the costs and timing of facility closures  business realignment  or similar actions  a significant change in commercial  automotive  agricultural  motorcycle or off highway vehicle production  competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing  the impact on changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales  costs and results  particularly the brazilian real  mexican peso and euro 
our ability to achieve cost reductions that offset or exceed customer mandated selling price reductions  a significant change in general economic conditions in any of the various countries in which we operate  labor disruptions at our facilities or at any of our significant customers or suppliers  the ability of our suppliers to supply us with parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis  the amount of our indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness  including our credit facility and the senior secured notes  customer acceptance of new products  capital availability or costs  including changes in interest rates or market perceptions  the failure to achieve the successful integration of any acquired company or business  and the items described in part i  item ia risk factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
the face amount of our senior secured notes was million at december  we currently have no borrowings outstanding on our asset based credit facility at december  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million to hedge our exposure to fair value fluctuations on a portion of our senior secured notes 
the swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed interest rate obligation under our million senior secured notes due october  under the swap  we pay a variable interest rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus and we receive a fixed interest rate of 
the swap requires semi annual settlements on april and october  which began on april  the critical terms of the swap are aligned with the terms of the senior secured notes  including maturity of october   resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness 
a hypothetical favorable or adverse change in the libor would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
in the past  we managed this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers and customers 
in the future  if we believe that the terms of a fixed price agreement become beneficial to us  we will enter into another such instrument 
we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing commodity costs by including a material pass through provision in our customer contracts whenever possible 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
the recent volatility in certain commodity costs has negatively affected our operating results 
at december  we have several fixed price swap contracts totaling million pounds of copper 
these contracts settle from january to december the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
we estimate that a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in the fair value of commodity prices would be approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange risk we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million as of december  the purpose of these foreign currency contracts is to reduce exposure related to the company s euro denominated receivables as well as to reduce exposure to future mexican peso denominated purchases 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december   per quoted market sources  was an asset of approximately million 
these foreign currency contracts expire during we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for our euro denominated receivables  as of december  a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for the company s mexican peso denominated payables as of december  it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we have significant operations in foreign locations 
as a result we are subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on net sales  operating costs  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the mexican peso  euro  swedish krona  british pound and brazilian real 
we estimate that a hypothetical favorable or adverse change of the us dollar relative to other currencies in would have a pre tax translation favorable unfavorable effect of million or million as of december
