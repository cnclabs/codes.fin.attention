the company is headquartered in warsaw  indiana and operates offices in thirteen counties in northern and central indiana 
the company earned million for versus million for  an increase of 
the increase was driven primarily by an million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a million increase in noninterest income 
offsetting these positive impacts was a million decrease in net interest income and a million increase in noninterest expense 
the company earned million for versus million for  an increase of 
the increase was driven primarily by a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a  increase in noninterest income 
offsetting these positive impacts was a million increase in noninterest expense and a  decrease in net interest income 
basic earnings per share for was per share versus per share for  an increase of  and per share for diluted earnings per share for was per share versus per share for  an increase of  and per share for diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilutive impact of warrants and stock awards granted under employee equity incentive plans 
basic and diluted earnings per share for was also impacted by the company s issuance of million common shares during the fourth quarter of and the company s issuance of the cpp preferred stock and a warrant to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock through the cpp during the company subsequently redeemed the cpp preferred stock in the second quarter of as a result of the second quarter redemption  the company recognized a non cash reduction in net income available to common stockholders of million  which represented the remaining unamortized accretion of the discount on the cpp preferred stock 
this non cash item impacted net income available to common stockholders and earnings per common share 
excluding the impact of this million accretion  diluted earnings per share would have been for the company s total assets were billion as of december  versus billion as of december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents from million at december  to million at december  this increase occurred as a result of a million increase in total deposits 
results of operations versus the company reported net income of million in  an increase of million  or  versus net income of million in net interest income decreased million  or  to million versus million in net interest income decreased primarily due to the decrease of the net interest margin from in to in resulting from a decrease in interest income from earning assets as market rates decreased from partially offsetting this decrease was interest income earned from a increase in average earning assets 
a increase in average commercial loans  which reflects our continuing strategic focus on commercial lending  also contributed to the increase 

table of contents interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was driven primarily by a basis point decrease in the company s yield on average earning assets  which resulted from a decrease in market rates and a decline in investment portfolio yields over the same time period 
several factors contributed to the decline in investment portfolio yields throughout  including steps in an ongoing strategic realignment of the portfolio with respect to private label mortgage backed securities and the impact of increased prepayments of agency mortgage backed securities 
in an ongoing effort to reduce the risk of incurring additional other than temporary impairment on certain private label mortgage backed securities and to improve the overall quality of the securities in the investment portfolio  the company sold a significant portion of these securities in march  august and september as part of the ongoing strategic realignment of its securities portfolio 
these actions impacted investment portfolio performance as the proceeds from the sale of the higher yielding private label mortgage backed securities were invested in lower yielding securities 
with respect to the impact of the increased prepayments of agency mortgage backed securities  there were two significant impacts  both of which became more pronounced as progressed 
the company s investment portfolio contains a significant concentration of agency mortgage backed securities 
as a result of actions by the federal reserve bank  including the announcement of qualitative easing qe late in the third quarter of  market mortgage rates have continued to decline throughout as a result  the industry has experienced a significant increase in the refinancing of mortgages 
this widespread refinancing has resulted in the prepayment of existing agency mortgage backed securities  including those held in the company s investment portfolio 
as a result of these prepayments  the proceeds have been reinvested in lower yielding securities  thereby reducing the net interest margin 
in addition  since the company purchased many of these agency mortgage backed securities at a premium  the prepayment of these types of securities has had an additional negative impact on the net interest margin of the company 
the prepayment of these securities has resulted in the company accelerating the amortization of the purchase premium associated with these securities 
the impact of this accelerated amortization of purchase premium has significantly impacted investment portfolio performance  and thereby the company s net interest margin 
the company was negatively affected by the accelerated premium amortization throughout  but it became more pronounced and impactful in the third and fourth quarter of that year 
the acceleration of premium amortization negatively affected the yield on agency mortgage backed securities by in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
as a result  the agency mortgage backed securities  which averaged million in  produced yields of in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio contained a total of agency mortgage backed securities with a total book value of million 
of that total   with a current book value of million  were purchased at a premium over issuance price 
the total premium at the time of purchase for these securities was million 
at december   of the agency mortgage backed securities purchased at a premium still had premium remaining 
this remaining unamortized premium associated with these securities at december  was million 
the company believes that this issue will continue to impact investment portfolio performance in  as mortgage refinancing activity continues and interest rates remain at historical lows 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the company s daily cost of funds in versus  which resulted from a decrease in market rates over the same time period 
average earning assets increased by million from billion in to billion in growth in the commercial loans portfolio accounted for most of the increase 
management believes that the growth in the loan portfolio will likely continue in a measured  but prudent  fashion as a result of our strategic focus on commercial lending  including commercial real estate lending  and in conjunction with the general expansion and penetration of the geographical markets the company serves  as well as our ongoing expansion in the indianapolis market 
the company increased deposits to fund the loan growth and most of the growth was through the increase of million in average interest bearing transaction accounts 
the increase in interest bearing transaction accounts was driven primarily by our promotion of the company s rewards checking product  which pays a higher interest rate on balances up to a maximum balance amount when certain conditions are met during each interest cycle 
the increase in average interest bearing transaction account balances did not translate into a higher cost of funds due to decreases in the weighted average rates of all funding sources during 
table of contents interest income was also affected by nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans were million  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at year end there were relationships totaling million loans classified as impaired as of december  versus relationships totaling million at the end of while there were many changes in nonaccrual loans in  the decrease in nonaccrual loans resulted primarily from charge offs of million taken on four commercial credits 
in addition  two commercial credits totaling million were paid off and one commercial credit of million was returned to accruing status 
the decrease in impaired loans also resulted from these charge offs and pay offs and one additional commercial credit charge off of million  offset by the addition of four other commercial relationships totaling million 
net charge offs were million in versus million in  representing and of average daily loans in and total nonperforming loans were million  or of total loans  at year end versus million  or of total loans  at the end of the provision for loan loss expense decreased to million in  resulting in an allowance for loan losses at december  of million  which represented of the loan portfolio  versus a provision for loan loss expense of million in and an allowance for loan losses of million at the end of  which represented of the loan portfolio 
the lower provision in versus was attributable to a number of factors but was primarily a result of stabilization or improvement in key loan quality metrics  including a decrease in net charge offs  strong reserve coverage of nonperforming loans  a decrease in historical loss percentages  continuing signs of stabilization in economic conditions in the company s markets and general signs of improvement in borrower performance and future prospects 
in addition  management gave consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
management s overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 
the company s management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels  asset quality  economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans

average earning assets increased by million from billion in to billion in as previously stated  the continued growth in our commercial loans portfolio accounted for most of the increase 
every region experienced loan growth during the year  and it was geographically diversified throughout our markets with the strongest growth occurring in the company s north and central regions 
management believed that the growth in the loan portfolio would likely continue in a measured  but prudent  fashion as a result of our strategic focus on commercial lending and in conjunction with the general expansion and penetration of the geographical markets the company serves  as well as our ongoing expansion in the indianapolis market

noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily driven by a million decrease in other than temporary impairment on several of the company s non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
other than temporary impairment was  in versus million in this decrease is due in part to the sale early in of six of the seven non agency residential mortgage backed securities on which the company had previously recognized other than temporary impairment  as well as market stabilization

as of december   the company had million of non agency mortgage backed securities which were not issued by the federal government or government sponsored agencies 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt instruments or trust preferred instruments as of december  the decrease in securities available for sale was a result of a number of activities in the securities portfolio 
security sales totaled million 
paydowns from prepayments and scheduled payments of million were received  and the amortization of premiums  net of the accretion of discounts  was million 
maturities and calls of securities totaled million 
other than temporary impairment of million was recognized on four non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
these portfolio decreases were offset by securities purchases totaling million 
the fair market value of the securities increased  the increase in market value was primarily driven by higher market values for the non agency mortgage backed securities which remained in the company s portfolio 
the investment portfolio is managed to provide for an appropriate balance between  liquidity  credit risk and investment return and to limit the company s exposure to risk to an acceptable level 
during the third quarter of  the company sold nine non agency residential mortgage backed securities as part of a strategic realignment of the investment portfolio 
the securities sold had a book value of million and a fair value of million 
the sales included all five of the non agency residential mortgage backed securities on which the company had previously recognized other than temporary impairment 
one of the non agency residential mortgage backed securities owned at december  paid off in may none of the remaining five private label collateralized mortgage obligations in the investment portfolio were still rated aaa aaa as of december  by at least one of the rating agencies  and one had been downgraded to below investment grade by at least one rating agency 
the company performs an analysis of the cash flows of these securities on a monthly basis based on assumptions as to collateral defaults  prepayment speeds  expected losses and the severity of potential losses 
based upon the initial review  securities may be identified for further analysis computing the net present value using an appropriate discount rate the current accounting yield and comparing it to the book value to determine if there is any other than temporary impairment to be recorded 
based on this analysis of the non agency residential mortgage backed securities  there was no other than temporary impairment or any unrealized loss on any of the five remaining non agency residential mortgage backed securities at december  real estate mortgages held for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on  among other things  recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market management expects to sell most of these mortgages in early the company generally sells almost all of the mortgage loans it originates on the secondary market 
during  million in real estate mortgages were originated for sale and million in mortgages were sold  compared to million and million in total loans  excluding real estate mortgages held for sale  increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the mix of loan types within the company s portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans 
this general increase in commercial loans was a result of the company s long standing strategic focus toward emphasizing origination of commercial loans 
the portfolio breakdown at year end and reflected commercial and industrial and agri business  residential real estate and home equity and consumer loans 

table of contents at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or of total loans outstanding  at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable incurred credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the considerations below 
the company has a relatively high percentage of commercial and commercial real estate loans  most of which are extended to small or medium sized businesses from a wide variety of industries 
commercial loans represent higher dollar loans to fewer customers and therefore higher credit risk than other types of loans 
pricing is adjusted to manage the higher credit risk associated with these types of loans 
the majority of fixed rate residential mortgage loans  which represent increased interest rate risk  are sold in the secondary market  as well as some variable rate residential mortgage loans 
the remainder of the variable rate residential mortgage loans and a small number of fixed rate residential mortgage loans are retained 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  if economic conditions do not continue to improve  certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the principal is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses relating to specifically identified loans based on an evaluation of the loans by management  as well as other probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon a monthly review of those credits 
an appropriate level of general allowance is determined after considering the following factors application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentrations  new industry lending activity and current economic conditions 
federal regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets on a regular basis 
the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard  doubtful or loss but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
the company s policy is to establish a specific allowance for loan losses for any assets where management has identified conditions or circumstances that indicate an asset is impaired 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the company s policy is to either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  the company had credits totaling million on the classified loan list versus credits totaling million on december  as of december   the company had million of assets classified as special mention  million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and classified as loss as compared to million  million  and  respectively at december  as of december  the company had loans totaling million accounted for as troubled debt restructurings 
included in the classified loan amounts above was one installment loan totaling  with an allocation of  mortgage loans totaling million with total allocations of  and commercial loans totaling million with total allocations of million 
the company has no commitments to lend additional funds to any of the borrowers 
at december   the company had loans totaling million accounted for as troubled debt restructurings mortgage loans totaling million with total allocations of  and commercial loans totaling million with total allocations of million 
of the million decrease of loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings at december   as compared to december   million was related to charge offs taken during an additional million was due to the payoff of two commercial loans 
allowance estimates are developed by management taking into account actual loss experience  adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the company s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  the allowance is provided for losses that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date and is based on past events and current economic conditions  and does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
for a more thorough discussion of the allowance for loan losses methodology see the critical accounting policies section of this item 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses decreased  or million  from million december  to million at december  pooled loan allocations increased million from million at december  to million at december   which was due to a small increase in pooled loan balances as well as management s view of current credit quality and the current economic environment 
impaired loan allocations decreased million from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to lower allocations on specific classified loans 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses was unchanged at million at december  and primarily due to stabilization in the current economic conditions and improvement in our borrowers performance and future prospects 
while general trends in credit quality were stable or favorable  the company believes that the unallocated component is appropriate given the uncertainty that exists regarding near term economic conditions  including the risk of an economic downturn 
in addition  the company has exposure in the agribusiness sector in the region  which experienced a drought in the ultimate impact of this drought  while not expected to be significant  was unknown at year end 
the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio 
traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management has historically considered growth and portfolio composition when determining loan loss allocations 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to the loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
while general trends in credit quality were stable or favorable  the company believes that the unallocated component is appropriate given the uncertaintyy that exists regarding near term economic conditions  including the risk of an economic downturn 
in addition  the company has exposure in the agribusiness sector in the region  which experienced a drought in the ultimate impact of this drought  while not expected to be significant  was unknown at year end 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in at december   total nonperforming loans decreased by million to million from million at december  loans delinquent days or more that were included in the accompanying financial statements as accruing totaled  versus  at december  for december  and  million and million of impaired loans were also included in the total for nonaccrual loans 
total impaired loans decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  while there were many changes in nonaccrual loans in  the decrease in nonaccrual loans resulted primarily from charge offs of million on four commercial credits 
in addition  two commercial credits totaling million were paid off and one commercial credit of million was returned to accruing status 
as discussed earlier  the decrease in impaired loans resulting from these commercial credit charge offs and payoffs and one additional commercial credit charge off of million was offset by the addition of four other commercial relationships totaling million 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance may be allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flow using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the allowance for loan loss to total loans percentage was in and in the company s total nonperforming loans were of total loans at year end and in however  the company s overall asset quality position can be influenced by a small number of credits due to the concentration of commercial lending activity 
although economic conditions in the company s markets have stabilized and in some areas shown improvement  management has not observed as rapid a recovery in certain industries  including residential and commercial real estate development and recreational vehicle and mobile home manufacturing  although each of these sectors has improved 
the company s continued growth strategy promotes diversification among industries as well as continued focus on enforcement of a strong credit environment and an aggressive position in loan work out situations 
while the company believes that the impact of these industry specific issues will be somewhat mitigated by its overall expansion strategy  the economic environment impacting its entire geographic footprint will continue to present challenges 
while the company has seen indications of improved economic conditions in its markets  they are not wide spread or particularly strong improvements 

table of contents bank owned life insurance increased by million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily to help offset employee benefit plan expenses  which have continued to increase since  by providing investment income from the securities the life insurance is invested in 
total deposits increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase resulted from increases of million in interest bearing transaction accounts primarily the company s rewards checking product  million in public fund certificates of deposit  million in demand deposits primarily commercial demand deposits and million in savings deposits primarily the company s rewards savings product 
these increases were offset by decreases of million in brokered deposits  in other certificates of deposit  million in certificates of deposit of  and over  million in money market accounts and million in cdars certificates of deposit 
as in  growth in savings and retail transaction accounts was driven by existing rewards checking and rewards savings products 
management intends to continue to promote these as the key retail banking products and expects growth to continue in these products although pending and proposed changes in legislature and regulatory arenas may affect the structure and pricing of the products 
as previously noted  the company has substantial funding from public fund entities 
a shift in funding away from public fund deposits could require the company to execute alternate funding plans under the contingency funding plan discussed in further detail under liquidity below 
total short term borrowings decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from decreases of million securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as decreases of million in federal funds purchased 
the company believes that a strong  appropriately managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by current accounting guidance available for sale afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier i risk based capital ratio of as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the federal reserve s well capitalized minimums of and  respectively 
the ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in was impacted by net income of million  as well as the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of  net of tax  positive pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   related to stock option exercises  and million in stock compensation expense 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in was impacted by net income of million  as well as the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of million  net of tax  negative pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   related to stock option exercises  and million in stock compensation expense 
the afs adjustment was primarily related to an basis point decrease in the two to five year treasury rates during management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to help ensure that stockholders equity will be adequate under various scenarios 
the increase in the cash dividend for versus was primarily due to the company paying the th quarter dividend in december  which normally would have been paid in february 
table of contents critical accounting policies certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates  in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  the valuation and other than temporary impairment of investment securities and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the principal is uncollectable 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans  although the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged against the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is taken based on management s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance 
a formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted monthly 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio  emerging market risk  emerging concentration risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss analysis 
in addition  management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
furthermore  management s overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision 
the determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
consideration is not limited to these factors although they represent the most commonly cited factors 
with respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits  management considers the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and the current valuation of collateral as the primary measures 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits 
with respect to pools of similar loans allocations are assigned based upon historical experience 
these allocations may be adjusted based on the other factors cited above 
an appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined after considering the following application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity and general economic conditions 
it is also possible that the following could affect the overall process social  political  economic and terrorist events or activities 
all of these factors are susceptible to change  which may be significant 
as a result of this detailed process  the allowance results in two forms of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration and internal loan review functions 
a credit grade is assigned to each commercial loan by both the commercial loan officer and the loan review department 
these grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a loan may or may not be graded the same 
the grade given by the loan review department is assigned in the company s loan system for individual credits 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that indicate the loan is impaired 
considerations with respect to specific allocations for these individual credits include  but are not limited to  the following a does the customer s cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan  b is there adequate collateral to repay the loan  c has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination  d is the loan impaired  e are there other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question  or f are there unique loan characteristics that require special monitoring 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans considered not to be individually impaired  but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
in addition  general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans 
these general pooled loan allocations are performed for portfolio segments of commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and multi family  agri business and agricultural  other commercial  consumer family mortgage and other consumer loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a three year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  subjectively adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 

table of contents due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as the level of classified credits  economic uncertainties  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the company s large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers 
mortgage servicing rights valuation mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recognized as assets for the full fair value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
subsequent measurement uses the amortization method where all servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and interest rate 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rates  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees and float income 
the company compares the valuation model inputs and results to published industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in regard to these other assumptions 
the servicing assets had fair market values of million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of msrs to an immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows dollars in thousands fair value of mortgage servicing assets constant prepayment speed psa impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should not be relied upon 
as the figures indicate  changes in value based on a and variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the servicing asset is calculated without changing any other assumption  however  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

table of contents on a monthly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and interest rate 
if impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
valuation and other than temporary impairment of investment securities the fair values of securities available for sale are determined on a recurring basis by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges or pricing models  which utilize significant observable inputs such as matrix pricing 
this is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities 
different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value 
at the end of each reporting period  securities held in the investment portfolio are evaluated on an individual security level for other than temporary impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance 
impairment is other than temporary if the decline in the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security will not be received 
significant judgments are required in determining impairment  which includes making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments  loss assumptions and the change in interest rates 
we consider the following factors when determining other than temporary impairment for a security or investment the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future  and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
for the non agency residential mortgage backed securities  additional independent analysis is performed to determine if other than temporary impairment needs to be recorded for these securities 
the independent analysis utilizes third party data sources which are then included in projections of the cash flows of the individual securities under several different scenarios based upon assumptions as to collateral defaults  prepayment speeds  expected losses and the severity of potential losses 
based upon the initial review using the analysis created with third party sources  securities may be identified for further analysis 
if any are identified  management makes assumptions as to prepayment speeds  default rates  severity of losses and lag time until losses are actually recorded for each security based upon historical data for each security and other factors 
cash flows for each security using these assumptions are generated and the net present value is computed using an appropriate discount rate the original accounting yield for the individual security 
the net present value is then compared to the book value of the security to determine if there is any other than temporary impairment that must be recorded 
if  in management s judgment  other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security will be written down to the computed net present value  and the unrealized loss will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings as if the loss had been realized in the period of other than temporary impairment 
in addition  discount accretion will be discontinued on any bond that meets one or both of the following the rating by s p  moody s or fitch decreases to below a and or the cash flow analysis on a security indicates under any scenario modeled by the third party there is a potential to not receive the full amount invested in the security

liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the liquidity structure is expressly detailed in the company s contingency funding plan  which is discussed below 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions as of the filing date of december  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal funds lines with twelve correspondent banks 
the company has approval to borrow up to million at the fhlb  but  given the company s current collateral structure and borrowings as of december   the company could have only borrowed up to million under this authority 
the company also has additional collateral that could be pledged to the fhlb of million as of december  further  the company had available capacity at the federal reserve bank of chicago of up to million given its current collateral structure and the terms of these facilities at december  the available collateral pool continues to be strengthened to further increase borrowing capacity with the federal reserve of chicago 
the company had all of its securities in the available for sale portfolio at december   allowing the company maximum flexibility to sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes the majority of the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of us government agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the us government 
approximately of the afs portfolio is invested in non agency residential mortgage backed securities  which the company believes are illiquid due to the current economic environment 
in addition  the company has historically sold the majority of its originated mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
the company has a formalized contingency funding plan cfp 
the board of directors and management recognize the importance of liquidity during times of normal operations and in times of stress 
the formal cfp was developed to ensure that the multiple liquidity sources available to the company are readily available 
the cfp specifically considers liquidity at the bank and the company level 
the cfp identifies the potential funding sources at the bank level  which includes the fhlb  the federal reserve bank  brokered certificates of deposit  certificates of deposit available from the cdars  repurchase agreements  and fed funds 
the cfp also addresses the bank s ability to liquidate its securities portfolio 
the cfp at the holding company level gives consideration to the possibility of establishing a holding company committed line of credit  as well as the ability to transfer securities from the bank to the holding company 
further  the plan identifies cfp team members and expressly details their respective roles 
potential risk scenarios are identified and the plan includes multiple scenarios  including short term and long term funding crisis situations 
under the long term funding crisis  two additional scenarios are identified a moderate risk scenario and a highly stressed scenario 
the cfp details the responsibilities and the actions to be taken by the cfp team under each scenario 
monthly reports to management and the board of directors under the cfp include an early warning indicator matrix and pro forma cash flows for the various scenarios 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this increase was an increase in deposit balances of million

these financial instruments include commitments to make loans and open ended revolving lines of credit 
the company follows the same credit policy including requiring collateral  if deemed appropriate to make such commitments as is followed for those loans that are recorded in its financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance is represented by the contractual amount of the commitments 
management does not expect any significant losses as a result of these commitments 
off balance sheet transactions are more fully discussed in note in the consolidated financial statements 
inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding effect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management alco and securities interest rate risk represents the company s primary market risk exposure 
the company does not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  does not own any significant derivative financial instruments and does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves the alco policy used to manage interest rate risk 
this policy sets guidelines for balance sheet structure  which are designed to protect the company from the impact that interest rate changes could have on net income  but it does not necessarily indicate the effect on future net interest income 
given the company s mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets on december  and using changes in the interest rate environment over a one year period  the net interest margin could be expected to decline in both a falling interest rate environment and in a rising rate environment 
during the federal reserve board s federal open market committee fomc kept the target federal funds rate at a range of to 
also during  the fomc abandoned its pledge to keep rates at this level through mid and replaced it with numerical thresholds it says are consistent with the mid pledge 
the thresholds are for the unemployment rate and a year forward forecast inflation rate of 
it will also consider other labor market indicators  inflation indicators  and inflation expectations 
due to the low rate environment and competitive markets for commercial loan pricing  there was a reduction in the company s yield on earning assets of basis points 
this decrease in the yield on earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in the rates paid on deposit accounts and purchased funds 
the rate paid on deposit accounts and purchased funds decreased basis points for the combined result of the decreases in the yield on earning assets and in the rates paid on deposits and purchased funds was a decrease in the net margin from for to for future changes in the net interest margin will be dependent upon multiple factors including further actions by the fomc during in response to economic conditions  competitive pressures in the various markets served  and changes in the structure of the balance sheet as a result of changes in customer demands for products and services 
the company utilizes computer modeling software to stress test the balance sheet under a wide variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model quantifies the income impact of changes in customer preference for products  basis risk between the assets and the liabilities that support them and the risk inherent in different yield curves  as well as other factors 
the alco committee reviews these possible outcomes and makes loan  investment and deposit decisions that maintain reasonable balance sheet structure in light of potential interest rate movements 
although management does not consider gap ratios in this planning  the information can be used in a general fashion to look at asset and liability mismatches 
the company s cumulative repricing gap ratio as of december  for the next months using a scenario in which interest rates remained unchanged was a negative of earning assets 
the company s investment portfolio consists of treasury securities  mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds
