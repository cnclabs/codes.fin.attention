overview amkor is one of the world s leading providers of outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services 
packaging and test are integral steps in the process of manufacturing semiconductor devices 
the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with the fabrication of individual transistors  or multiple transistors and other electronic elements combined into an integrated circuit generally known as a chip or die  onto semiconductor material such as a silicon wafer 
each chip on the wafer is probe tested 
the good chips are identified and the wafer is then separated into individual die 
each good die is then assembled into a package that typically encapsulates the die for protection and creates the electrical connections used to connect the package to a printed circuit board  module or other part of the electronic device 
in some packages  chips are attached to a substrate or leadframe carrier through wirebonding or flip chip interconnects and then encased in a protective material 
or  for a wafer level package  the electrical interconnections are created directly on the surface of the die while the wafer is still intact so that the chip may be attached directly to other parts of an electronic device without a substrate or leadframe 
the packages are then tested using sophisticated equipment to ensure that each packaged chip meets its design and performance specifications 
the test services we offer include probe testing and final testing 
our packaging services are designed to meet application and chip specific requirements including the type of interconnect technology employed  size  thickness and electrical  mechanical and thermal performance 
we are able to provide turnkey packaging and test services including semiconductor wafer bump  wafer probe  wafer backgrind  package design  packaging  test and drop shipment services 
our customers include  among others altera corporation  analog devices  inc  broadcom corporation  intel corporation  lsi corporation  qualcomm incorporated  sony corporation  stmicroelectronics nv  texas instruments incorporated and toshiba corporation 
the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive 
we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers 
our business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors  such as world wide gross domestic product and consumer spending 
historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between world wide gross domestic product levels  consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical downturns in the past 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery 

table of contents our net sales  gross profit  operating income  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of many factors  including the seasonality of our business  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in part  item a of this annual report on form k 
our net sales decreased million or to  million in from  million in the decrease was driven by a decline of million or in packaging net sales partially offset by an increase in test net sales of million or 
the decrease in packaging net sales was primarily the result of weakness in the consumer  networking and auto and industrial end markets  partially offset by strength in the communications end market for smartphones and tablets 
the increase in test net sales was primarily driven by strength in the communications end market for smartphones and tablets 
gross margin for decreased to from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our wirebond packaging services and the corresponding lower level of utilization of these manufacturing assets  the estimated million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and lower net sales due to insourcing by some of our integrated device manufacturer idm customers 
the loss contingency charge reduced our gross margin by two percentage points 
the decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of flip chip and wafer level packages  as well as increased test net sales supporting mobile communications 
we operate in a capital intensive industry and have a significant level of debt 
servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures  which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without any firm customer commitments 
we fund our operations  including capital expenditures and debt service requirements  with cash flows from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under available credit facilities  and proceeds from any additional financing 
maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity is important to our business and depends on  among other things  the performance of our business  our capital expenditure levels and our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings 
in  our capital additions totaled million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in our capital additions were driven by investments in advanced test platforms and packaging equipment supporting the communications end market  as well as research and development projects 
in  of our capital additions were made in packaging  for test and for research and development and infrastructure projects 
in  of our capital additions were made in packaging  for test and for research and development and infrastructure projects 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we experienced negative free cash flow of million for the year ended december   compared to free cash flow of million in the prior year 
our negative free cash flow was primarily driven by capital purchases to support customer demand for packaging and test services related to mobile communications and an increase in accounts receivable 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not defined by u 
s generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  and a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is set forth under the caption cash flows below 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales gross margin depreciation and amortization operating income income before income taxes net income attributable to amkor net sales change over over in thousands  except percentages net sales packaging net sales test net sales net sales 
net sales in decreased compared to due to lower net sales of our packaging services 
the decrease in packaging net sales was partially offset by an increase in test net sales 
net sales in decreased compared to primarily as a result of lower net sales of our packaging and test services 
net sales for the year ended december   were also negatively impacted by the supply chain disruptions in japan caused by the march earthquake and tsunami 
packaging net sales 
packaging net sales in decreased compared to the decrease in packaging net sales was the result of weakness in the consumer  networking and auto and industrial end markets 
in particular  packaging net sales related to home electronics and gaming were lower than historical levels due to insourcing by some of our idm customers and lower demand for our wirebond packaging services 
these decreases were partially offset by strength in the communications end market for smartphones and tablets 
packaging unit volume increased billion units in to billion units  compared to billion units in  primarily due to increases in wafer level and flip chip chip scale packaging services  partially offset by decreases in wirebond array and leadframe packaging services 
packaging net sales in decreased compared to the decrease in packaging net sales was primarily driven by weakness in sales of our ball grid array and leadframe packaging solutions partially offset by strong sales of our chip scale packaging solutions supporting mobile communications products 
packaging unit volume decreased billion units in to billion units  compared to billion units in  primarily attributable to decreased demand for our leadframe packaging solutions 
test net sales 
test net sales in increased compared to due to strong demand for mobile communications products  such as smartphones and tablets 
test net sales in decreased compared to primarily as a result of decreased demand from the computing and consumer end markets partially offset by increased test services for mobile communications products 

table of contents cost of sales change over over in thousands  except percentages cost of sales our cost of sales consists principally of materials  labor  depreciation and manufacturing overhead 
since a substantial portion of the costs at our factories is fixed  relatively modest increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our gross margin 
material costs as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in as a result of higher test net sales  which consume few materials  and a shift to a mix of packaging services with a lower material content as a percentage of net sales 
material costs in absolute dollars primarily decreased in due to the net sales mix described above and lower net sales 
material costs as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in primarily due to the increased cost of gold that is used in most of our wirebond packaging solutions 
material costs in absolute dollars decreased in as a result of the decline in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  labor costs decreased to in from in the decrease in labor costs as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars was primarily driven by labor cost savings from restructuring activities at our manufacturing operations in japan in early and the philippines in as a percentage of net sales  labor costs increased to in from in the increase in labor costs as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of lower levels of utilization driven by decreased customer demand and the corresponding decrease in net sales 
as substantially all of our manufacturing workforce is paid in asian currencies  labor costs were also negatively impacted by the appreciation of certain asian based currencies against the us dollar in compared to in addition  labor wage rates increased in and the year also includes a million charge for workforce reduction programs at our philippine manufacturing operations compared to a million workforce reduction charge in other manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to the estimated million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and increased depreciation expense from our continued investment in property  plant and equipment 
other manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in other manufacturing costs in increased as a percentage of net sales primarily as a result of lower levels of utilization driven by decreased customer demand and the corresponding decrease in net sales 
the increase in other manufacturing costs in absolute dollars in was primarily attributable to the appreciation of certain asian based currencies against the us dollar and increased depreciation from our continued investments in property  plant and equipment 
these costs were partially offset by overhead cost savings from the closure of our singapore manufacturing operations 
gross profit change over over in thousands  except percentages gross profit gross margin gross profit and gross margin in decreased compared to the decrease in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our wirebond packaging services and the corresponding lower level of utilization of these manufacturing assets  the estimated million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and lower net sales due to insourcing by some of our idm customers 
these decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of flip chip and wafer level packages as well as increased test net sales supporting mobile communications 

table of contents gross profit and gross margin in decreased compared to the decrease was primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our packaging solutions and the corresponding lower level of utilization of our manufacturing assets 
the market migration from wirebond to flip chip products created underutilized wirebond capacity faster than we were able to redeploy these assets  which was one of the primary contributors to our decrease in utilization 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by the appreciation of certain asian based currencies against the us dollar  the increased cost of gold that is used in most of our wirebond packages  increased depreciation expense as a result of our continued investment in property  plant and equipment and charges for workforce reduction programs at our philippine manufacturing operations 
change over over in thousands  except percentages packaging gross profit packaging gross margin packaging gross profit 
gross profit and gross margin for packaging net sales in decreased compared to the decreases in gross profit and gross margin were primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our wirebond packaging services and the corresponding lower level of utilization of these manufacturing assets  the tessera loss contingency charge discussed above  which relates entirely to the packaging segment  and lower net sales due to insourcing by some of our idm customers 
these decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of flip chip and wafer level packages supporting mobile communications 
gross profit and gross margin for packaging sales in decreased compared to the decrease in gross profit and gross margin was attributable to weakness in demand for some of our packaging solutions and the corresponding lower level of utilization of our manufacturing assets

change over over in thousands  except percentages test gross profit test gross margin test gross profit 
gross profit and gross margin for test sales in increased compared to the increases in gross profit and gross margin were mainly attributable to higher utilization of our test assets and higher test net sales 
costs of sales for test services are primarily fixed in nature and have relatively low material content 
accordingly  increases in net sales or utilization generally result in increased gross profit and gross margin due to the high degree of operating leverage for these services 
gross profit and gross margin for test sales in decreased compared to the decrease in gross profit and gross margin was primarily driven by lower utilization of our test assets as well as higher labor costs and increased depreciation expense as a result of our continued investment in property  plant and equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses change over over in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of reduced employee compensation expense and lower professional fees  partially offset by charges from our restructuring activities in selling  general and administrative expenses in increased compared to the increase was mainly attributable to increased professional fees and  to a lesser extent  higher employee compensation and benefits primarily due to merit increases and share based compensation 
these increases were offset by lower contracted services in for the continued implementation of our global enterprise resource planning information system 
research and development change over over in thousands  except percentages research and development research and development activities are focused on developing new packaging interconnect and test services and improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes 
areas of focus include d packaging  including silicon interposers and through silicon via technologies  fine pitch copper pillar packaging and wafer level processing 
research and development expenses in increased compared to in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
research and development expenses represented of net sales in compared to of net sales in the increase in research and development expenses was driven by increased depreciation from capital additions as a result of our continued investment in research and development initiatives 
research and development expenses in increased compared to the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increased employee salary expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in compared to in due to lower net sales and the increased research and development expenses 
other expense  net change over over in thousands  except percentages interest expense  net foreign currency loss loss on debt retirement  net equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate other income  net total other expense  net interest expense in increased compared to due to million of estimated interest related to our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and higher levels of debt 
interest expense in decreased compared to primarily due to debt refinanced at lower interest rates and the conversion of our convertible notes due into common stock 
in  we incurred a million loss on debt retirement associated with the prepayment of certain subsidiary term loans due in and in  we recorded a million loss on debt retirement due to the refinancing of our convertible senior subordinated notes due may and the full redemption of our senior notes due in  we recorded million of debt retirement costs as a result of the redemption of the senior notes due and the senior notes due 
table of contents income tax expense change over over in thousands  except percentages income tax expense generally  our effective tax rate is substantially below the us federal tax rate of because we have experienced tax losses in the us and much of our income is taxed in foreign jurisdictions where we benefit from tax holidays or tax rates lower than the us statutory rate 
income tax expense in and is attributable to income tax on profits earned in certain foreign jurisdictions  foreign withholding taxes  minimum taxes  and deferred taxes on undistributed earnings from our investment in j devices 
the increase in income tax expense in compared to is attributable to the increase in income tax rates in jurisdictions where tax holidays have partially expired  taxation in a jurisdiction that previously benefited from a net operating loss carryforward and taxation of foreign currency gains in connection with debt denominated in us dollars in a foreign jurisdiction 
income tax expense in is attributable to income tax on profits earned in certain of our taxable foreign jurisdictions  million of net additions to estimates of our uncertain tax positions  foreign withholding taxes and minimum taxes partially offset by a million income tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets in taiwan 
during  our subsidiaries in china  korea  the philippines and taiwan operated under tax holidays which will continue to expire in whole or in part at various dates through we expect our effective tax rate to increase as the tax holidays expire  as income earned in these jurisdictions will be subject to higher statutory income tax rates 
in connection with our land purchase in korea in february  we intend to increase our capital in korea within three years by at least million through foreign investment pursuant to the foreign investment promotion act  thereby  availing ourselves of certain additional tax incentives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of income tax holidays 
at december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards totaling million which expire at various times through additionally  at december   we had million of non us net operating loss carryforwards  which will expire at various times through we maintain a valuation allowance on all of our us net deferred tax assets  including our net operating loss carryforwards  and on deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we will release such valuation allowances as the related tax benefits are realized on our tax returns or when sufficient net positive evidence exists to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as the trend of taxable operating results in one of our foreign jurisdictions has been improving over the past year  we believe a reasonable possibility exists that  within the next year  sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion to release up to million of the valuation allowance maintained in this jurisdiction as of december  
table of contents quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated financial data for the last eight quarters ended december  our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
we believe that we have included all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our selected quarterly data 
you should read our selected quarterly data in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our net sales  gross profit and operating income are generally lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year primarily due to the effect of consumer buying patterns in the us  europe and asia 
semiconductor companies generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of december which results in a reduction in demand for packaging and test services during the first two weeks of january 
we recorded a charge of million to cost of sales and million to interest expense during the three months ended june   and an additional charge of million to cost of sales and million to interest expense during the three months ended december   related to our pending patent license arbitration 
the calculation of basic and diluted per share amounts for each quarter is based on the weighted average shares outstanding for that period  consequently  the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted net income per share

based on this assessment  we believe that our cash flow from operating activities  together with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our debt facilities  will be sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  our liquidity will continue to be affected by  among other things  volatility in the global economy and credit markets  the performance of our business  our capital expenditure levels  other uses of our cash including the final amount of payments due in our disputes with tessera  any purchases of stock under our stock repurchase program  any investments in joint ventures or acquisitions and our ability to either repay debt out of operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings 
in light of possible investment 
table of contents opportunities  we are exploring additional lines of credit of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows  or be able to borrow sufficient funds  to meet the funding needs of our business beyond the next twelve months due to a variety of factors  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
our primary source of cash and the source of funds for our operations are cash flows from our operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under available debt facilities and proceeds from any additional debt or equity financings 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under our million first lien senior secured revolving credit facility 
additionally  our foreign subsidiaries had million available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and million available to be borrowed under term loans 
in  we borrowed an additional million under our term loans 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we expect cash flows to be used in the operation and expansion of our business  making capital expenditures  paying principal and interest on our debt and for other corporate purposes 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
total debt at december  was  million 
our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our debt and interest 
we refer you to contractual obligations below for a summary of principal and interest payments 
we operate in a capital intensive industry 
servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and make significant capital expenditures  which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without any firm customer commitments 
we sponsor an accrued severance plan for our korean subsidiary which  under existing tax laws in korea  limits our ability to deduct related severance expenses accrued under that plan 
the purpose of these limitations is to encourage companies to migrate to a defined contribution or defined benefit plan 
if we retain our existing severance plan  the deduction for severance expenses will be primarily limited to severance payments made to retired employees  which results in a larger current income tax liability in korea 
if we decide to adopt a new plan  we may fund a significant portion of the existing liability  which would provide a current tax deduction upon funding 
our korean severance liability was million as of december  included in our cash balance as of december   is million held offshore by our foreign subsidiaries 
if we were to distribute this offshore cash to the us as repatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  we would incur up to million of foreign withholding taxes  however  we would not incur a significant amount of us federal income taxes  due to the availability of tax loss carryovers and foreign tax credits 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  exclusive of any fees  commissions or other expenses 
we did not purchase any stock under the plan for the three months ended december  through december   we had repurchased million shares for million  net of million of commissions  leaving a balance of million available at december  for stock repurchases under this program 
the purchase of stock may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the timing  manner  price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors including economic and market conditions  the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business  price  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
our stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
we have a equity interest and options to acquire additional equity interests in j devices  a joint venture among amkor  toshiba and the original shareholders of j devices  which provides semiconductor packaging and test services in japan 
the options are exercisable at our discretion and permit us to increase our ownership interest in j devices 
in january  we exercised our option to increase our ownership interest in j devices from to for an aggregate purchase price of billion approximately million 
the transaction is expected to close in april  subject to regulatory approval 
future options permit us to increase our ownership up to in by purchasing shares owned by one of the other shareholders and up to in by purchasing shares owned by the other shareholders 
in and beyond  toshiba has the option  at its discretion  to sell shares it owns to us if we have exercised any of our options 
after we own or more shares  the original shareholders of j devices have a put option which allows them to sell their shares to us 
the exercise price for all options is payable in cash and is to be determined using a formula based primarily upon the net book 
table of contents value and a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of j devices 
the governance provisions applicable to j devices restrict our ability  even after obtaining majority ownership  to cause j devices to take certain actions without the consent of the other investors 
accordingly  we account for our investment in j devices using the equity method of accounting 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
increasing our investment in j devices has risks  including those discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the caption difficulties consolidating and integrating our operations we face challenges as we integrate diverse operations 
we refer you to note to our consolidated financial statements in part i  item of this annual report for a discussion of the pending arbitration relating to amkor license agreement with tessera 
we expect to use cash on hand  proceeds from borrowings under our existing lines of credit or other sources to make any payments due in connection with our litigation with tessera 
in january  we sold office space and land located in chandler  arizona for million 
in february  we entered into an agreement for the purchase of land for a new factory and research and development center in korea 
we paid billion approximately million at signing  with two remaining payments of billion approximately million and billion approximately million due in august and november  respectively 
we expect to spend approximately million over the next several years for the construction of the facility 
in order to reduce leverage and future cash interest payments  we may from time to time repurchase our outstanding notes for cash or exchange shares of our common stock for our outstanding notes 
any such transactions may be made in the open market  through privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to the terms of the notes or otherwise and would be subject to the terms of the indentures and other debt agreements  market conditions  and other factors 
in september  we issued million of senior notes due october the notes and used the net proceeds to repay million of subsidiary debt 
certain debt agreements have restrictions on dividend payments and the repurchase of stock and subordinated securities  including our convertible notes 
these restrictions are determined by calculations based upon cumulative net income 
we have never paid a dividend to our stockholders and we do not have any present plans for doing so 
amkor technology  inc also guarantees certain debt of our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months 
additional information about our debt is available in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
capital additions we make significant capital additions in order to service the demand of our customers 
our capital additions increased as we transitioned to new packaging and test technologies 
in  our capital additions totaled million or approximately of net sales 
of this total  approximately of our capital additions were made in packaging  in test and for research and development and infrastructure projects 
our spending was focused primarily on investments in advanced test platforms and packaging equipment supporting the communications end market  as well as research and development projects 
we expect that our capital additions will be approximately million  in addition to million of spending for the acquisition of land and construction relating to our new factory and research and development center in korea 
our expected capital additions for primarily support customer demand for packaging and test services related to mobile communications 
ultimately  the amount of our capital additions will depend on several factors including  among others  the timing and implementation of any capital projects under review  the performance of our business  economic and market conditions  the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business  the need for additional capacity to service anticipated customer demand and the availability of cash flows from operations or financing 

table of contents in february  we entered into an agreement for the purchase of land for a factory and research and development center in korea 
the land purchase price is billion approximately million  payable in installments over the next ten months 
we expect to spend million in for the acquisition of the land and construction relating to the korean facility using cash on hand or borrowings 
over the next several years  we expect to spend a total of approximately million for the construction of the facility 
the agreement to purchase the land for the facility is subject to our compliance with various construction  investment  hiring  regulatory and other requirements 
there can be no assurance that the new facility project will proceed at all  or that the actual scope  costs  timeline or benefits of the project will be consistent with our current expectations 
in addition  we are subject to risks associated with our capital additions  including those discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the caption capital additions we make substantial capital additions to support the demand of our customers  which may adversely affect our business if the demand of our customers does not develop as we expect or is adversely affected 
the following table reconciles our activity related to property  plant and equipment additions as presented on the consolidated balance sheets to purchases of property  plant and equipment as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  in thousands property  plant and equipment additions net change in related accounts payable and deposits purchases of property  plant and equipment cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we experienced negative free cash flow of million for the year ended december   which was primarily driven by capital purchases to support customer demand for packaging and test services related to mobile communications and an increase in accounts receivable 
our free cash flow for the year ended december   was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in gross profit 
free cash flow is not a us gaap measure 
see below for a further discussion of free cash flow and a reconciliation to us gaap 
net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for each of the three years ended december  was as follows for the year ended december  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities in decreased by million compared to operating income for the year ended december  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  other operating activities and non cash items decreased million from the decrease was primarily driven by the estimated million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses recognized in interest expense  net  for the year ended december   increased by million as compared with the year ended december   as a result of the interest related to our arbitration with tessera and higher levels of long term debt 
operating cash flows in and were reduced by million and million  respectively  for fees in connection with debt repurchases 
changes in assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows during by million principally due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by increases in accrued expenses 
accrued expenses increased primarily due 
table of contents to the accrual for estimated royalties and interest relating to our arbitration with tessera 
during  changes in assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by million  principally due to a decrease in accounts receivable 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities in increased by million 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment from million in to million in  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from property  plant and equipment from the sale of our singapore facility for million 
financing activities our net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the net cash provided by financing activities during included borrowings of million offset by million of foreign debt repayments  the repurchase of million of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program and payment of million in debt issuance costs associated with the the issuance of our senior notes due in and the amendment and restatement of our first lien senior secured revolving credit facility 
cash used in financing activities during consisted principally of borrowings of million offset by million of debt repayments  the repurchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase program and payment of million in debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of our senior notes due in we provide the following supplemental data to assist our investors and analysts in understanding our liquidity and capital resources 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not defined by us gaap 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides them with additional information in assessing our liquidity  capital resources and financial operating results 
our management uses free cash flow in evaluating our liquidity  our ability to service debt and our ability to fund capital additions 
however  free cash flow has certain limitations  including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other  non discretionary expenditures  such as mandatory debt service  are not deducted from the measure 
the amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods 
this measure should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  other measures of liquidity or financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap  such as net cash provided by operating activities 
furthermore  our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  plant and equipment free cash flow 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due for year ending december  total thereafter in thousands total debt scheduled interest payment obligations purchase obligations operating lease obligations severance obligations total contractual obligations scheduled interest payment obligations were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable at december   for variable rate debt 
represents capital related purchase obligations outstanding at december  represents estimated benefit payments for our korean subsidiary severance plan 
in addition to the obligations identified in the table above  other non current liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at december   include million of net foreign pension plan obligations for which the timing and actual amount of funding required is uncertain 
we expect to contribute million to the plans during million net liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and the timing of any future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period of ultimate settlement  if any  with the various taxing authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet guarantees or other off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k  other than our operating lease obligations described above in contractual obligations 
other contingencies we refer you to note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of our contingencies related to litigation and other legal matters 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in these matters  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business  liquidity  results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the period in which the ruling occurs 
the potential impact from the legal proceedings on our business  liquidity  results of operations  financial position and cash flows could change in the future 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
a summary of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements appears in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from our packaging and test services when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally these criteria are met and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
if the revenue recognition criteria are not met  we defer the revenue 
deferred revenue generally results from two types of transactions invoicing at interim points in the packaging and test process prior to delivery and customer advances 
deferred revenue relates to contractual invoicing at interim points prior to the delivery of the finished product 
the invoicing that is completed in advance of our revenue recognition criteria being met is recorded as deferred revenue 
customer advances represent supply agreements with customers where we commit capacity in exchange for customer prepayment of services 
these prepayments are deferred and recorded as customer advances within accrued expenses and other non current liabilities 
we generally do not take ownership of customer supplied semiconductor wafers 
title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at all times 
accordingly  the cost of the customer supplied materials is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
an allowance for sales credits is recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable during the period of sale such that accounts receivable is reported at its estimated net realizable value 
the allowance for sales credits is an estimate of the future credits we will issue for billing adjustments primarily for invoicing corrections and miscellaneous customer claims and is estimated based upon recent credit issuance  historical experience and specific identification of known or expected sales credits at the end of the reporting period 
additionally  provisions are made for doubtful accounts when there is doubt as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as bad debt expense and is classified as selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of doubtful accounts considering the age of the receivable balance  the customer s historical payment history and current credit worthiness as well as specific identification of any known or expected collectibility issues 
income taxes 
we operate in and file income tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities 
the tax returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to change upon examination 
we believe that we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for potential additional taxes and related interest expense that may ultimately result from such examinations 
we believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there can be no assurance that the outcomes will be favorable 
in addition  changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays or changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates in the future 
additionally  we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
us gaap requires companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
as a result of net losses experienced in recent years in certain jurisdictions  we have determined that a valuation allowance is required for certain deferred tax assets including those related to all of our net operating loss carryforwards in the us we will release such valuation allowances as the related deferred tax benefits are realized on our tax returns or when sufficient net positive evidence exists to conclude it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation of inventory 
we order raw materials based on customers forecasted demand 
if our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendors require that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand  we will experience a build up in raw material inventory 
we will either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in production 
however  we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or be able to use the inventory in production and  accordingly  if we believe that it is probable that we will not be able to recover such costs we reduce the carrying value of our inventory 
additionally  we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the cost of inventory we estimate is excess and obsolete based on the age of our inventories 
when a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production or is not saleable  it is written off 

table of contents inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is principally determined by standard cost on a first in  first out basis for raw materials and purchased components and an average cost basis for work in process or by the weighted moving average method for commodities and spare parts  both of which approximate actual cost 
we review and set our standards as needed  but at a minimum on an annual basis 
long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets which are as follows land use rights years buildings and improvements to years machinery and equipment to years software and computer equipment to years furniture  fixtures and other equipment to years cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in earnings 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a long lived asset group to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less the costs of disposal 
legal contingencies 
we are subject to certain legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we accrue for a loss contingency  including legal proceedings  lawsuits  pending claims and other legal matters  when we conclude that the likelihood of a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts  and no amount in the range constitutes a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue for the amount at the low end of the range 
we adjust our accruals from time to time as we receive additional information  but the loss we incur may be significantly greater than or less than the amount we have accrued 
we disclose loss contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
our assessment of required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
the present legislative and litigation environment is substantially uncertain  and it is possible that our liquidity  results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of our pending litigation and other claims 
recently adopted and recently issued standards for information regarding recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in interest rates 
our use of derivative instruments  including forward exchange contracts  has historically been insignificant  however  we continue to evaluate the use of hedging instruments to manage currency and other risks 
we have not entered into any derivative transactions during the year ended december  and have no outstanding contracts as of december  foreign currency risk as of december   we do not have forward contracts or other instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency gains and losses 
we generally use natural hedging techniques to reduce foreign currency rate risk 
the us dollar is our reporting currency and the functional currency for the majority of our foreign subsidiaries including our largest subsidiaries in korea and the philippines and also our subsidiaries in china  singapore and taiwan 
for our subsidiaries and affiliate in japan  the local currency is the functional currency 
we have foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
we performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of december   to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
assuming a adverse movement for all currencies against the us dollar as of december   our income before income taxes for would have been approximately million lower 
in addition  we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our results of operations 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net sales were denominated in us dollars 
our remaining net sales were principally denominated in japanese yen and korean won for local country sales 
for the year ended december   approximately of our cost of sales and operating expenses were denominated in us dollars and were largely for raw materials and factory supplies 
the remaining portion of our cost of sales and operating expenses was principally denominated in the asian currency where our production facilities are located and largely consisted of labor and utilities 
to the extent that the us dollar weakens against these asian based currencies  similar foreign currency denominated transactions in the future will result in higher sales and higher operating expenses  with operating expenses having the greater impact on our financial results 
similarly  our sales and operating expenses will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies 
we performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of december   to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated sales and expenses 
assuming a adverse movement from the year ended december   exchange rates of the us dollar compared to all of these asian based currencies as of december   our operating income for would have been approximately million lower 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements across multiple jurisdictions are similar and would be linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market or other changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations 
we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our stockholders equity as a result of the translation of our subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the local currency  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in reduced sales  operating expenses  assets and liabilities 
similarly  our sales  operating expenses  assets and liabilities will increase if the us dollar weakens against the local currencies 
the effect of foreign exchange rate translation on our consolidated balance sheet for the years ended december  and  was a net foreign translation loss of million and a gain of million  respectively  and was recognized as an adjustment to equity through other comprehensive income 

table of contents interest rate risk we have interest rate risk with respect to our long term debt 
as of december   we had a total of  million of debt of which was fixed rate debt and was variable rate debt 
as of december   we had a total of  million of debt of which was fixed rate debt and was variable rate debt 
the fixed rate debt consists of senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
our variable rate debt principally relates to our foreign borrowings and revolving lines of credit and any amounts outstanding under our million senior and secured revolving line of credit  under which no amounts were drawn as of december  changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the instrument but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not generally impact the fair value of the instrument 
the fair value of the convertible notes is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock 
the table below presents the interest rates  maturities and fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december  thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed rate debt in thousands average interest rate variable rate debt in thousands average interest rate for information regarding the fair value of our long term debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
equity price risk we have convertible notes that are convertible into our common stock 
if investors were to decide to convert their notes to common stock  our future earnings would benefit from a reduction in interest expense and our common stock outstanding would be increased 
if we paid a premium to induce such conversion  our earnings could include an additional charge 
further  the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future
