financial information on segments autoliv considers its products to be components of integrated automotive safety systems  which fall within a single industry segment 
autoliv has two main operating segments  passive safety products airbags  seatbelts  steering wheels  restraint electronics  and active safety products vision  night vision  radar 
for financial reporting purposes these two operating segments have been combined into a single reportable segment in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc segment reporting 
the financial data relating to autoliv s business in this segment over the last three fiscal years is contained in the consolidated financial statements on pages through of the annual report and is incorporated herein by reference 
a statement of net sales by product group for the last three years is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of the annual report and is incorporated herein by reference 
products  market and competition information concerning products  markets and competition is included in the sections headed active safety systems  passive safety systems and innovations for the future on pages  our market and competitors on pages and  and in the management discussion and analysis sections dependence on customers  new competition and patents and proprietary technology on pages and of the annual report and is incorporated herein by reference 
manufacturing and production including joint venture operations  autoliv has approximately wholly or partially owned or leased production facilities located in countries  consisting of both component factories and assembly factories 
see item properties for a description of autoliv s principal properties 
the component factories manufacture inflators  initiators  gas generants  textile cushions  webbing materials  electronics  pressed steel parts  springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seatbelt and airbag assembly  steering wheels and our active safety  vision and night vision systems and our other safety electronic systems 
the assembly factories source components from a number of parties  including autoliv s own component factories  and assemble complete restraint systems for just in time delivery to customers 
these factories also assemble our active safety  vision and night vision systems 
the products manufactured by autoliv s consolidated subsidiaries in consisted of approximately million complete seatbelt systems of which approximately million were fitted with pretensioners  approximately million side impact airbags including curtain airbags  approximately million frontal airbag modules  approximately million steering wheels  approximately million electronic units airbag control  approximately million active safety systems 
autoliv s just in time delivery systems have been designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service 
just in time deliveries require final assembly  or at least  distribution centers in geographic areas close to customers to facilitate rapid delivery 
the fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as those produced in europe  japan or the united states increases the importance to suppliers of having assembly capacity in several countries 
consolidation among our customers also supports this trend 

table of contents if the supply of raw materials and components is not disrupted  autoliv s assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations 
when dramatic shifts in light vehicle production occurs  autoliv can generally adjust capacity in response to changes in demand within a few weeks by adding or removing work shifts and within a few months by adding or removing standardized production and assembly lines 
most of autoliv s assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity 
as a result  autoliv can usually adjust its manufacturing capacity faster than its customers can adjust their capacity to fluctuations in the general demand for vehicles or in the demand for a specific vehicle model  provided that customers notify autoliv when they become aware of such changes in demand 
when dramatic shifts in light vehicle production occur  the adjustments can take more time and be more costly 
see also risk factors we could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain  which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production 
quality management autoliv believes that superior quality is a prerequisite for it to be considered a leading global supplier of automotive safety systems and is key to our financial performance  since quality excellence is critical for winning new orders  preventing recalls and maintaining low scrap rates 
autoliv has for many years emphasized a zero defect proactive quality policy and continues to strive to improve its working methods 
this means both that autoliv s products must always meet performance expectations  and that autoliv s products must be delivered to its customers at the right times and in the right amounts 
furthermore  our continued quality improvements further enhance our image among customers  employees and authorities 
although quality has always been paramount in the automotive industry  especially for safety products  vehicle manufacturers have become even more quality focused with even less tolerance for any deviations 
this intensified quality focus is partially due to an increase in the number of vehicle recalls due to a variety of reasons not just safety coupled with a few vehicle recalls 
this trend is likely to continue as vehicle manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements 
we have not been immune to the recalls that have been impacting the entire automobile industry 
in response to this trend and to improve our own quality  we launched in the summer of the next step in our strategy of shaping a proactive quality culture of zero defects 
it is called q because it addresses quality in five dimensions products  customers  growth  behavior and suppliers 
the goal of q is to firmly tie together quality with value within all our processes  and for all our employees  thereby leading to the best value for our customers 
in and  we expanded this quality initiative with additional training to more employees 
in our pursuit of excellence we have developed a chain of four defense lines against quality issues 
these defense lines consist of robust product designs  flawless components from suppliers and our own in house component companies  manufacturing of flawless products and implementing systems for verifying that our products conform with specifications and an advanced traceability system in the event of a recall 
our pursuit of excellence extends from the earliest phases of product development to the proper disposal of a product following many years of use in a vehicle 
autoliv s comprehensive autoliv product development system apds process includes several key check points during the development of new products that are designed to ensure that new products are well built and have no hidden defects 
in this way  we proactively prevent problems and ensure we deliver only the best designs to the market 

table of contents the autoliv production system aps is at the core of autoliv s manufacturing philosophy 
aps integrates essential quality elements  such as mistake proofing  statistical process control and operator involvement  into the manufacturing processes so all autoliv associates are aware of and understand the critical connection between themselves and our lifesaving products 
this zero defect principle extends beyond autoliv to the entire supplier base 
the global autoliv supplier manual  which is based on strict automotive standards  defines our quality requirements and focuses on preventing bad parts from being produced by our suppliers and helps eliminate bad intermediate products in our assembly lines as early as possible 
autoliv continues to execute its plan to have all subsidiaries certified to iso ts  a global automotive quality management standard

autoliv personnel at december   autoliv and its subsidiaries had approximately  employees and approximately  temporary personnel 
autoliv considers its relationship with its personnel to be good and has not experienced any major strike or other significant labor dispute in recent years 
important unions to which some of autoliv s employees belong in europe include ig metall in germany  amicus in the united kingdom  conf d ration generale des travaileurs and conf d ration fran aise d mocratique du travail in france  federacion minerometalurgica  union general de trabajadores  union sindical obrera and comisiones obereras in spain and swedish metal workers union and the swedish association of graduated engineers in sweden 
in addition  autoliv s employees in other regions are represented by the following unions the national automotive  aerospace and general workers union of canada caw  and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam in canada  sindicato nacional de trabajadores de la industria metalurgica y similares  sindicato de trabajadores de la pequena y mediana industria and sindicato de jornaleros y obreros industiales de la industria maquiladora in mexico  and sindicato dos trabalhadores nas industrias metalurgicas  mecanicas e de material eletrico e eletronico  siderurgicas  automobilsticas e de autopecas de taubate in brazil  and the korean metal workers union 
in many european countries in which we operate  wages  salaries and general working conditions are negotiated with local unions and or are subject to centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements 
the terms of our various agreements with unions typically range between years 
most of our subsidiaries in europe must negotiate with the applicable local unions important changes in operations  working and employment conditions 
in the united kingdom and the united states there is far less union involvement in establishing wages  salaries and working conditions 
twice a year  the company s management conducts a meeting with the european work council ewc to provide employee representatives with important information and a forum for the exchange of ideas and opinions 
many asia pacific countries regulate salary adjustments on an individual basis each year 
in south korea and thailand  employee organizations are involved in various processes

see also item a risk factors our business is exposed to risks inherent in global operations 
joint ventures an important element of autoliv s strategy has been to establish joint ventures to promote its geographical expansion and technological development and to gain assistance in marketing autoliv s full product line to local automobile manufacturers 
autoliv is not currently involved in any joint ventures that have been formed for the purpose of developing technology  but it is possible that strategic alliances combining autoliv s technologies and expertise with that of others may expand business opportunities in the future 
autoliv s current joint ventures are focused on establishing a presence in growth markets 
autoliv typically contributes design and production knowledge to joint ventures  with the local partner providing sales support and manufacturing facilities 
some of these local partners manufacture and sell standardized seatbelt systems  and will  through the joint venture with autoliv  be able to upgrade their technology to meet specific customer demands and or expand their product offerings

item a risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors 
a discussion of the risks associated with these factors is included below 
risks related to our industry the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business our business is directly related to automotive vehicle production by our customers 
automotive production is highly cyclical and depends on general economic conditions as well as other factors  including consumer spending and preferences and changes in interest 
table of contents rate levels and credit availability  consumer confidence  fuel costs  fuel availability  environmental impact  governmental incentives  and political volatility  especially in energy producing countries and growth markets 
in addition  automotive sales and production can be affected by our customers ability to continue operating in response to challenging economic conditions and in response to changing labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
any significant adverse change in any of these factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions and the resulting bankruptcy of a customer or the closure of a customer manufacturing facility  may result in a reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers  and thus have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our sales are also affected by inventory levels of our customers 
we cannot predict when our customers will decide to either increase or reduce inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels 
this may exacerbate variability in our sales and financial condition 
uncertainty regarding inventory levels may be exacerbated by consumer financing programs initiated or terminated by our customers or governments as such changes may affect the timing of their sales 
again  any significant reduction in automotive sales and or production by our customers  whether due to general economic conditions or any other fact s relevant to automotive production  will likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
change in consumer trends and political decisions affecting vehicle sales could adversely affect our results in the future during  global production of large sized cars dropped by from the level compared to an overall decrease of global lvp of 
in  global production of large sized cars was less than in despite the fact the overall global lvp increased by 
this drop was particularly pronounced in western europe and north america where many of the cars in the large size segment have safety content values of more than per vehicle 
this mix shift had a negative impact on autoliv s market as the value of safety systems in large sized cars is often more than twice as high as in a low end vehicle for the markets in north america and western europe 
in vehicles for the growth markets  the difference is even more significant 
for example  the strong lvp growth in china and india has currently created a dilutive effect  since the average safety value per vehicle in these markets of approximately and  respectively  are below the global average of around car consumer trends such as this could accelerate in the future  especially as a result of political initiatives aimed at or having the effect of directing demand more towards smaller cars 
as safety content per vehicle is also an indicator of our sales development  should the current trends continue  the average value of safety systems per vehicle could decline and negatively affect our sales and margins 
we operate in highly competitive markets the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
the market for occupant restraint systems has undergone a significant consolidation during the past fifteen years 
we compete with a number of other manufacturers that produce and sell similar products 
among other factors  our products compete on the basis of price  product quality  manufacturing and distribution capability  product design  product delivery and product service 
some of our competitors are subsidiaries or divisions  units or similar of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than us 
some of our competitors may also have a preferred status as a result of special relationships with certain customers 
our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do  develop products that are superior to our products  have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than we can  or adapt 
table of contents more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving regulatory  industry or customer requirements 
we may also encounter increased competition in the future from existing or new competitors 
as a result  our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products 
should this happen  we will suffer material adverse effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the discontinuation or loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability although we have frame contracts with many of our customers  these frame contracts generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular model and assembly plant  rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
furthermore  these frame contracts are often subject to renewal re quotation at the customer s option at periodic intervals  sometimes as frequent as on a year to year basis 
therefore  the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to  or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model or a particular vehicle brand for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
while we believe this risk is mitigated by the fact that our sales are split over several hundred contracts covering approximately  vehicle platforms or vehicle models  a significant disruption in the industry  a significant decline in overall demand or a dramatic change in vehicle preferences could have a material adverse effect on our sales  as it did in risks related to our business escalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business the automotive industry has been characterized by increasingly aggressive pricing pressure from customers for many years 
this trend is partly attributable to the major automobile manufacturers strong purchasing power 
as with other automotive component manufacturers  we are often expected to quote fixed prices or are forced to accept prices with annual price reduction commitments for long term sales arrangements or discounted reimbursements for engineering work 
our future profitability will depend upon  among other things  our ability to continuously reduce our cost per unit and maintain our cost structure  enabling us to remain cost competitive 
our profitability is also influenced by our success in designing and marketing technological improvements in automotive safety systems which help us offset price reductions by the original equipment manufacturers oems 
if we are unable to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures  these price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain  which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production we  as with other component manufactures in the automotive industry  ship products to the vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a just in time basis in order to maintain low inventory levels 
our suppliers external suppliers as well as our own production sites also use a similar method 
however  this just in time method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 
the potential loss of one of our suppliers or our own production sites could be caused by a myriad of potential problems  such as closures of one of our own or one of our suppliers plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes  mechanical breakdowns  electrical outages  fires  explosions  political upheaval  as well as logistical complications due to 
table of contents weather  volcanic eruptions  earthquakes  flooding or other natural disasters  mechanical failures  delayed customs processing and more 
additionally  as we expand in growth markets  the risk for such disruptions is heightened 
the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products  for whatever reason  could force us to cease production  even for a prolonged period 
similarly  a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products 
even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped  delays may arise before they reach our customer 
our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components 
this may cause our customers to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products  which may adversely affect our financial performance 
when we cease timely deliveries  we have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the root cause problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products 
generally  we must also carry the costs associated with catching up  such as overtime and premium freight 
additionally  if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us 
these losses and expenses could be very significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits 
thus  any supply chain disruption  however small  could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers  and any such shutdown could expose us to material claims of compensation 
where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time  we may not be fully compensated  if at all 
for example  in early volcanic activity in iceland caused widespread and unprecedented delays in air travel 
additionally  severe flooding during the monsoon season in thailand disrupted our supply and distribution chain in the region 
the events triggered by the march  earthquake and tsunami in japan caused extensive and severe damage  impacting not only manufacturing facilities of automotive suppliers including sub suppliers and manufacturers but also of transportation  energy and distribution infrastructure 
such disruptions  whether caused by a volcano  earthquake  flooding or some other natural disaster  could cause significant delays and complications to our ability to ship our products to customers  as well as receive shipments from our suppliers 
also  similar difficulties for other suppliers may force our customers to halt production  which may in turn impact our sales shipments to such customers 
it is impossible for us to predict if and when disruptions of air  ground and sea transport will occur again and  if so  what impact such disruptions will have 
any such disruptions could severely impact our operations and or those of our customers and force us to halt production for prolonged periods of time and or to absorb very significant costs to avoid disruption of our customers operations 
changes in the source  cost  availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins our business uses a broad range of raw materials and components in the manufacture of our products  nearly all of which are generally available from a number of qualified suppliers 
strong worldwide demand for certain raw materials has had a significant impact on raw material prices and short term availability in recent years 
our business has not generally experienced significant or long term difficulty in obtaining raw materials  but increases in the price of the raw materials and components in our products could materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our profit margin  as direct materials costs amounted to approximately of our net sales in  of which approximately half is the raw material cost portion 
commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers may not always offset all of the adverse impact of higher raw material  energy and commodity costs 
in addition  no 
table of contents assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of such cost increases or any future cost increases could not have a larger adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position than currently anticipated 
additionally  pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the sec has promulgated new rules regarding disclosure of the presence in a company s products of certain metals mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries  known as conflict minerals  as well as disclosure regarding a manufacturer s procedures to identify the sourcing of those minerals from this region 
there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements  including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products  processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities 
the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing  supply and pricing of materials used in our products 
as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement 
adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability any significant disruption in our supplier relationships  particularly relationships with single source suppliers  could harm our profitability 
furthermore  some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility and or sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect 
over time  more of our suppliers are located in growth markets 
as such  there is a risk for delivery delays  production delays  production issues or delivery of non conforming products by our suppliers 
even where these risks do not materialize  we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers we are dependent on a relatively few number of automobile manufacturers with strong purchasing power  as a result of high market concentration that has developed due to customer consolidation during the last few decades 
our five largest customers represented of our consolidated sales for our largest contract accounted for approximately of our total fiscal sales and expires in although business with any given customer is typically split into several contracts either on the basis of one contract per vehicle model or on a broader platform basis  the loss of all of the business from any of our primary customers whether by cancellation of existing contracts or the failure to award us new business could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
customers may put us on a new business hold which would limit our ability to quote or be awarded all or part of their future vehicle contracts if quality or other issues arise in the vehicles for which we were a supplier 
such new business holds range in length and scope and are generally accompanied by a certain set of remedial conditions that are required to be met prior to being eligible to bid for new business 
although such new business holds generally do not have an immediate material impact on our business or results of operations  we are committed to meeting any such conditions as quickly as possible  which may require additional company resources in the short term 
a failure to satisfy such remedial conditions may have a materially adverse impact on our financial results in the long term 
information concerning our major customers is included in the annual report in a graph on page and in the section headed our customers and in note of the consolidated financial statements on page of the annual report 

table of contents we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and our business may suffer as a result of adverse outcomes of current or future legal proceedings we are  from time to time  involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that may be significant 
these claims may include  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes  including disputes with our suppliers  intellectual property matters  regulatory matters and governmental investigations  personal injury claims  environmental issues  tax and customs matters and employment matters 
such legal proceedings  including regulatory actions and government investigations  may seek recovery of very large indeterminate amounts or to limit our operations  and the possibility that they may arise and their magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
a substantial legal liability or adverse regulatory outcome and the substantial cost to defend the litigation or regulatory proceedings may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  cash flows and reputation 
no assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position or that reserves or insurance will mitigate such impact 
see note of the consolidated financial statements on page of the annual report 
we are currently undergoing an antitrust investigation by the european commission and it is probable that the company s operating results and cash flows will be materially adversely impacted the european commission ec is engaged in a long running investigation into possible anti competitive behavior among certain suppliers to the automotive vehicle industry  including autoliv 
from june to june   representatives of the ec visited two facilities of autoliv bv co kg  a company subsidiary in germany  to gather information for such inquiry 
the ec s investigation is still ongoing 
it is the company s policy to cooperate with governmental investigations 
although the duration or ultimate outcome of the ec investigation cannot be predicted or estimated  it is probable that the company s operating results and cash flows will be materially adversely impacted for the reporting periods in which the ec investigation is resolved or becomes estimable 
the company remains unable to estimate the impact the ec investigation will have or predict the reporting periods in which such impact may be recorded 
the company s recent settlement with the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj does not impact the ec s ongoing investigation  as the ec investigation is a separate matter that involves the application of different legal standards 
we are subject to investigations by two other competition authorities and may be subject to investigations by additional competition authorities that could negatively impact our business competition authorities in canada and south korea have recently initiated investigations of certain suppliers to the automotive vehicle industry  including autoliv 
competition authorities in additional countries  including japan  may do the same 
these types of investigations require significant management time and attention  as the ec and doj investigations already have 
these investigations could also result in significant expenses as well as unfavorable outcomes that could have a material adverse impact on our customer relationships  business prospects  reputation  operating results  cash flows or financial results 

table of contents we are subject to civil antitrust litigation in the us following the doj settlement and may be subject to additional civil antitrust litigation in the us or elsewhere that could negatively impact our business following the company s guilty plea as part of the doj settlement  the company and its competitors were sued in multiple purported class action lawsuits in the us and canada alleging violations of antitrust and related laws and seeking to recover treble damages for the alleged classes of direct purchasers  auto dealers and vehicle purchasers lessees 
the company may be subject to additional civil antitrust lawsuits in the future in the us  canada or in other countries that permit such civil claims 
these types of lawsuits require significant management time and attention and could result in significant expenses as well as unfavorable outcomes that could have a material adverse impact on our customer relationships  business prospects  reputation  operating results  cash flows or financial results 
we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
accordingly  we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of our products are  or are alleged to be  defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products 
every vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers  and the performance and remedial requirements vary between jurisdictions 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims 
in addition  with global platforms and procedures  vehicle manufacturers are increasingly evaluating our quality performance on a global basis  any one or more quality  warranty or other recall issue s including issues affecting few units and or having a small financial impact may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures which may have a severe impact on our operations  such as a global temporary or prolonged suspension of new orders 
in addition  as our products more frequently use global designs and are based on or utilize the same or similar parts  components or solutions  there is a risk that the number of vehicles affected globally by a failure or defect will increase significantly and hence also our costs 
a warranty  recall or product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business 
vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties 
a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or the entire repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties  when the product supplied did not perform as represented 
accordingly  the future costs of warranty claims by our customers may be material 
however  we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements 
our warranty reserves are based upon our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims 
although we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate  the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 
work stoppages or other labor issues at our customers facilities or at our facilities could adversely affect our operations the severe conditions in the automotive industry and actions taken by our customers and other suppliers to address negative industry trends may have the side effect of causing labor relations problems at those companies 
if any of our customers experience a material work stoppage  that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products 
similarly  a work stoppage at another supplier could interrupt production at one of our customers plants which would have the same effect 
this could cause us to shut down production 
table of contents facilities supplying these products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while labor contract negotiations at our locations historically have rarely resulted in work stoppages  we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions or that our failure to do so will not result in work stoppages 
a work stoppage at one or more of our plants or our customers facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies effectively depends  in part  on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees 
in addition  our future success will depend on  among other factors  our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel  particularly engineers and other employees with electronics and software expertise 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
similarly  we are committed to safeguarding our employees as well as our production facilities by employing several policies  standards and procedures related to site risk management 
in view of major external events during recent years  there is no certainty that our efforts to protect against potential natural hazards and political events throughout the areas and countries where autoliv is active will be successful in protecting our employees 
if we fail to adequately protect against these hazards  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
restructuring initiatives are complex and difficult and at any time additional restructuring steps may be necessary  possibly on short notice and at significant cost our restructuring initiatives include efforts to adjust our manufacturing capacity  including plant closures  transfer of sourcing to low cost countries  consolidation of our supplier base and standardization of products 
and to reduce our overhead costs  our restructuring initiatives include consolidation of tech centers 
the successful implementation of our restructuring activities will require us to involve sourcing  logistics  technology and employment arrangements 
the complex nature of our various restructuring initiatives could cause difficulties or delays in the implementation of any such initiative or it may not be immediately effective  resulting in an adverse material impact on our performance 
in addition  there is a risk that inflation  high turnover rates and increased competition may reduce the efficiencies now available in low cost countries to levels that no longer allow for cost beneficial restructuring opportunities 
a prolonged recession and or another downturn in our industry could result in our having insufficient funds to continue our operations without additional financing activities our ability to generate cash from our operations is highly dependent on sales and therefore on light vehicle production  the global economy and especially the economies of our important markets 
if light vehicle production were to remain on low levels for an extended period of time  this would result in a significantly negative cash flow 
similarly  if cash losses for customer defaults rise sharply  this would also result in a negative cash flow 
such negative cash flow could result in our having insufficient funds to continue our operations unless we can procure external financing  which may not be possible 

table of contents a prolonged recession and or another downturn in our industry could result in external financing not being available to us or available only on materially different terms than what has historically been available although our credit rating was upgraded in  our current credit rating could be lowered as a result of us experiencing significant negative cash flows or a dire financial outlook 
this may affect our ability to procure financing 
we may also for the same  or other reasons  find it difficult to secure new long term credit facilities  at reasonable terms  when our existing credit facility expires in these risks are exacerbated by the current instability in the global credit markets  including the on going european economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries and to the overall eurozone 
further  even our existing unutilized credit facilities may not be available to us as agreed  or only at additional cost  if participating banks are unable to raise the necessary funds  where  for instance  financial markets are not functioning as expected or one or more banks in our revolving credit facility syndicate were to default 
if external financing is unavailable to us when necessary  we may have insufficient funds to continue our operations 
information concerning our credit facilities and other financings are included in the annual report on page in the section headed treasury activities and in note to the consolidated financial statements on pages and of the annual report 
our level of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations as of december   we have outstanding debt of million  including million in privately placed debt issued in we may incur additional debt for a variety of reasons 
although our revolving credit facilities do not have any financial covenants  our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of any interest or could be used for amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness  increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  depending on the levels of our outstanding debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes may be limited  and potential future tightening of the availability of capital both from financial institutions and the debt markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to access additional capital 
our customers may be unable to pay our invoices there is a risk that one or more of our major customers will be unable to pay our invoices as they become due or that a customer will simply refuse to make such payments given its financial difficulties 
we invoice our major customers through their local subsidiaries in each country even for global contracts 
we thus try to avoid having all of our receivables with a single multinational customer group 
in each country  we also monitor invoices becoming overdue and take legal action to enforce such obligations where possible and prudent 
if a major customer would enter into bankruptcy proceedings or similar proceedings whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification  or if a major customer otherwise successfully procures protection against us legally enforcing its obligations  it is likely that we will be forced to record a substantial loss 

table of contents governmental restrictions may impact our business adversely some of our customers are owned by a governmental entity  receive various forms of governmental aid or support or are subject to governmental influence in other forms 
as a result  they may be required to procure components from local suppliers to achieve a specific local content or be subject to other restrictions regarding localized content 
the nature and form of any such restrictions or protections  whatever their basis  is very difficult to predict as is their potential impact 
however  they are likely to be based on political rather than economical or operational considerations and may severally impact our business 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets for possible impairment  the value of one or more of our assets may not be realized if one or more of our customers cease production or decrease their production volumes and we could be required to write down amounts of certain assets and record impairment charges if one or more of our customers plants cease production or decrease their production volumes  the assets we carry related to our plants serving such customers may decrease in value because we may no longer be able to utilize or realize them as intended 
where such decreases are significant  whether as to specific customers or geographic areas  such impairments may have a materially adverse impact on our financial results 
we periodically review the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment  if future circumstances indicate that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired  we could be required to write down amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets and record impairment charges we monitor the various factors that impact the valuation of our goodwill and other intangible assets  including expected future cash flow levels  global economic conditions  market price for our stock  and trends with our customers 
impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from  among other things  deterioration in our performance and especially the cash flow performance of these goodwill assets  adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations 
if there are changes in these circumstances or the other variables associated with the estimates  judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of goodwill  when assessing the valuation of our goodwill items  we may determine that it is appropriate to write down a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets and record related non cash impairment charges 
in the event that we determine that we are required to write down a portion of our goodwill items and other intangible assets and thereby record related non cash impairment charges  our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we face risks related to our defined benefit pension plans  including the need for additional funding as well as higher costs and liabilities our defined benefit pension plans may require additional funding or give rise to higher related costs and liabilities which  in some circumstances  could reach material amounts and negatively affect our results of operations 
we are required to make certain year end assumptions regarding our pension plans 
our pension obligations are dependent on several factors  including factors outside our control such as changes in interest rates  the market performance of the diversified investments underlying the pension plans  actuarial data and adjustments and an increase in the minimum funding requirements or other regulatory changes governing the plans 
adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit market may have an unfavorable impact on the value of our pension assets and our future estimated pension liabilities 
internal factors such as an adjustment to the level of benefits provided under the plans may also lead to an increase in our pension liability 
if these or other internal and external risks were to occur  alone or in combination  our required contributions to the plans and the costs and net liabilities associated with the plans could increase substantially and have a material effect on our business 
information concerning our defined benefit plans is included in note of the consolidated financial statements on pages through of the annual report 
you should not anticipate or expect the payment of cash dividends on our common stock our dividend policy is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon a number of factors  including our earnings  financial condition  cash and capital needs and general economic or business conditions 
although we currently use dividends as a way to 
table of contents return value to our stockholders  during the second quarter of until the third quarter of  our board of directors suspended our quarterly dividend after determining that a suspension was necessary in light of the decline in global light vehicle production  the uncertainty surrounding the recession at the time and the inherent risk of customer defaults 
while we have resumed the payment of dividends on our common stock  in the future  there can be no assurance that the board of directors will continue to declare dividends 
increases in it security threats  the sophistication of computer crime and our reliance on global data centers could expose our systems  networks  solutions and services to risks as the world s largest automotive safety system supplier with worldwide facilities  we rely extensively on information technology it systems and the use of our global data centers 
these it systems and data centers are vulnerable to disruptions  including those resulting from natural disasters  cyber attacks or failures in third party provided services 
disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality  availability and integrity of our and our customers data 
as a result  such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the leakage of confidential information  including our intellectual property  improper use of our systems and networks  manipulation and destruction of data  production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to international operations our business is exposed to risks inherent in global operations due to our global operations  we are subject to many laws governing international relations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act  which prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where and how we can do business  what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to authorities in governmental organizations 
although we have procedures and policies in place that should mitigate the risk of violations of these laws  there is no guarantee that they will be sufficiently effective 
if and when we acquire new businesses  we may not be able to ensure that the pre existing controls and procedures meant to prevent violations of the rules and laws were effective  and we may not be able to implement effective controls and procedures to prevent violations quickly enough when integrating newly acquired businesses 
we also have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many countries 
some of these countries are growth markets 
international operations  especially in growth markets  are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  inability to collect  or delays in collecting  vat withholding and other customs and taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  exposure to local political turmoil  expropriation and nationalization  enforcing legal agreements or collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  lack of liquidity in foreign currency due to governmental restrictions on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters  
table of contents currency controls  investment restrictions or requirements  and export and import restrictions 
increasing our manufacturing footprint in the growth markets and our business relationships with automotive manufacturers in these markets are particularly important elements of our strategy 
as a result  our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
global integration may result in additional risks because of our efforts to integrate our operations globally to manage cost  we face the additional risk that  should any of the other risks discussed herein materialize  the negative effects could be more pronounced 
for example  while supply delays of a component have typically only affected a few customer models  such a delay could now affect several models of several customers in several geographic areas 
additionally  as we move our operations to lower cost countries  we have witnessed an increase in our exposure to risks associated with developing countries  such as the risk of political upheaval 
similarly  should we face a recall or warranty issue due to a defective product  such a recall or warranty issue is now more likely to involve a larger number of units in several geographic areas 
exchange rate risks in addition  as a result of our global presence  a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we are therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure 
such risks and exposures include transaction exposure  which arises because the cost of a product originates in one currency and the product is sold in another currency  translation exposure in the income statement  which arises when the income statements of non us subsidiaries are translated into non us dollars  and translation exposure in the balance sheet  which arises when the balance sheets of non us subsidiaries are translated into non us dollars 
for example  the financial crisis during caused extreme and unprecedented volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations may occur again and may impact our financial results 
we cannot predict when  or if  this volatility will cease or the extent of its impact on our future financial results 
we typically denominate foreign transactions in foreign currencies and have not engaged in hedging transactions  although we may engage in hedging transactions from time to time in the future relating to foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  growth markets are more likely to utilize foreign currency restrictions that govern the transfer of funds out of such country 
as we continue to increase our presence in such countries  there is an increased risk that such foreign currency controls may create difficulty in repatriating profits from lower cost countries in the form of taxes or other restrictions 

table of contents risks related to acquisitions we face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions our growth has been enhanced through acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that we believe will complement our business 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  frequently engage in acquisition discussions  conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engage in acquisition negotiations 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets 
in addition  we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources  and competition with these companies for acquisition targets could result in increased prices for possible targets 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks to us and our investors  including risk in retaining acquired management and employees  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of known and unknown or contingent liabilities  adverse financial impact from the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  incurrence of indebtedness  potential adverse financial impact from failure of acquisitions to meet internal revenue and earnings expectations  integration of internal controls  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  and potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 
in the future  the best growth opportunities may be in passive safety electronics and active safety systems markets  which include and are likely to include other and often larger companies than our traditional competitors 
if we fail to adequately manage these acquisition risks  the acquisitions may not result in revenue growth  operational synergies or service or technology enhancements  which could adversely affect our financial results 
risks related to intellectual property if our patents are declared invalid or our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others  our ability to compete may be impaired we have developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to automotive safety systems and rely on a number of patents to protect such technology 
at present  we hold more than  patents covering a large number of innovations and product ideas  mainly in the fields of seatbelt and airbag technologies 
we utilize  and have often access to  the patents of our joint ventures 
our patents expire on various dates during the period to we do not expect the expiration of any single patent to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we believe that our products and technology do not infringe the proprietary rights of others  third 
table of contents parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
also  any patents now owned by us may not afford protection against competitors that develop similar technology 
we primarily protect our innovations with patents and vigorously protect and defend our patents  trademarks and know how against infringement and unauthorized use 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary rights and technology  we could lose those rights and incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights 
our means of protecting our intellectual property  proprietary rights and technology may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar or competitive technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights or increased costs 
if claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and successfully prosecuted against us  they could result in substantial costs 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop non infringing technology  our business  financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products changes in legislative  regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive 
our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products will not become obsolete 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly 
to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry  we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers demand in a timely manner 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production  or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs  for which we might supply products 
our failure to successfully launch new products  a delay by our customers in introducing our new products  or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs  could adversely affect our results 
risks related to government regulations our business may be adversely affected by environmental  occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations we are subject to the requirements of environmental  occupational health and safety and other governmental regulations in the united states and other countries 
although we have no known pending material environmental related issues  we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements 
to reduce our exposure to environmental risk  we implemented an environmental plan in based on our environmental policy 
according to the plan  we 
table of contents sought to certify according to iso  an international standard for environmental management systems  all of our plants and units 
as of december   of our facilities representing of our consolidated sales have been certified according to iso most of our remaining plants are new facilities which have not been certified yet 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with all of these requirements or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements in excess of amounts that we  at each time  may have reserved 
in addition  environmental and occupational health and safety and other requirements are complex  subject to change and have tended to become more and more stringent 
accordingly  such requirements may change or become more stringent in the future 
any material environmental issues or changes in environmental or other governmental regulations may have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
our business may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations or concerns government safety regulations are a key driver in our business 
historically  these regulations have imposed ever more stringent safety regulations for vehicles and have thus been a driver of growth in our business 
however  these regulations are subject to change based on a number of factors that are not within our control  including new scientific or medical data  adverse publicity regarding the safety risks of airbags or seatbelts for instance  to children and small adults  domestic and foreign political developments or considerations  and litigation relating to our products and our competitors products and more 
changes in government regulations in response to these and other considerations could have a severe impact our business 
additionally  governments have different regulatory agendas at different times 
an increased focus on environmental regulations relating to automobiles such as green house gas emissions or gas mileage instead of safety regulations may impact the safety content of vehicles 
although we believe that over time safety will continue to be a regulatory priority  if government priorities shift and we are unable to adapt to changing regulations our business may suffer material adverse effects 
additional information relating to our environmental management is included in the annual report in the section contribution to protecting the environment on page and in the management s discussion and analysis section environmental on page of the annual report 
negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous non us jurisdictions  which are inherently uncertain 
negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  changes in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles or in their application with respect to matters such as tax rates  transfer pricing  dividends  restrictions on certain forms of tax relief or limitations on favorable tax treatment could affect our effective tax rate in the united states or in other countries and  as a result  have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
for example  our ability to take advantage of expected favorable tax treatment including those associated with r d credits and loss carry forwards may be significantly impaired as a result of changes to the conditions associated with such favorable treatments 
such changes may be the result of general attempts to remedy fiscal deficits or implement shifts in social policies  such as discouraging headcount reductions or similar actions 

table of contents the public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  is currently unable to inspect the audit work of auditors working in sweden  including our auditor because we are a public company in the us  our auditor is required to undergo regular pcaob inspections to assess compliance with us law and professional standards in connection with its audit of our financial statements filed with the sec 
the pcaob  however  is currently unable to inspect the audit work and practices of auditors in sweden  where our head office is located  even if they are  as our auditors  part of a major us based international accounting firm 
as a result  if the pcaob and sweden are unable to reach an agreement allowing access  investors who rely on our auditor s audit reports are deprived of the benefits of pcaob inspections of our auditor 
management of the company expects our auditor to adhere to the highest applicable standards and to take measures to ensure that these standards are consistent with the requirements of the pcaob 
however  we cannot exclude the possibility that pcaob inspections could strengthen the adherence to such standards and or detect failures to do so

table of contents additional information relating to the company s properties is included in the section titled superior global presence on pages and of the annual report and is incorporated herein by reference 
item legal proceedings various claims  lawsuits and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company or its subsidiaries  covering a range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities with respect to commercial  product liability and other matters 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and the outcome of any litigation cannot be assured 
after discussions with counsel  and with the exception of losses resulting from the antitrust matters described below  it is the opinion of management that the various legal proceedings and investigations to which the company currently is a party will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position of autoliv  but the company cannot provide assurance that autoliv will not experience material litigation  product liability or other losses in the future 
general litigation in  autoliv initiated a closure of its normandy precision components npc plant located in france 
most of the former npc employees that were not protected ie not union representatives filed claims in a french court claiming damages in an aggregate amount of million approximately million and or other remedies 
in february  the french court ruled in favor of plaintiffs in an aggregate amount of million approximately million  while rejecting certain other claims 
both sides have appealed the decision as far as not in their favor 
as required under french law  autoliv has paid the million award pending the appeal 
in may  a french court placed eric molleux technologies composants emt into receivership  and liquidation proceedings were initiated in july as a result of autoliv s previous relationship with emt  in march the liquidator initiated proceedings against autoliv france and requested payment of million approximately million  which represents the total amount of debt owed by emt to its creditors including autoliv 
the liquidator also requested an additional million approximately million corresponding to the debts of autoliv turkey towards emt 
autoliv disputes the claims 
antitrust matters authorities in several jurisdictions are currently conducting broad  and in some cases  long running investigations of suspected anti competitive behavior among parts suppliers in the global automotive vehicle industry 
these investigations include  but are not limited to  segments in which the company operates 
in addition to pending matters  authorities of other countries with significant light vehicle manufacturing or sales may initiate similar investigations 
it is the company s policy to cooperate with governmental investigations 

table of contents on february   a company subsidiary received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj related to its investigation of anti competitive behavior among suppliers of occupant safety systems 
on june   the company entered into a plea agreement with the doj and subsequently pled guilty to two counts of antitrust law violations involving a japanese subsidiary and paid a fine of million 
under the terms of the agreement the company will continue to cooperate with the doj in its investigation of other suppliers  but the doj will not otherwise prosecute autoliv or any of its subsidiaries  present or former directors  officers or employees for the matters investigated the doj did reserve the option to prosecute three specific employees  none of whom is a member of the senior management of the company 
on june   representatives of the european commission ec  the european antitrust authority  visited two facilities of a company subsidiary in germany to gather information for a similar investigation 
the investigation is still pending and the company remains unable to estimate the financial impact such investigation will have or predict the reporting periods in which such financial impact may be recorded and has consequently not recorded a provision for loss as of december  however  management has concluded that it is probable that the company s operating results and cash flows will be materially adversely impacted for the reporting periods in which the ec investigation is resolved or becomes estimable 
on october   the company received a letter from the competition bureau of canada related to the subjects investigated by the doj and ec  seeking the voluntary production of certain corporate records and information related to sales subject to canadian jurisdiction 
on november   the korean fair trade commission visited one of the company s south korean subsidiaries to gather information for a similar investigation 
the company cannot predict the duration  scope or ultimate outcome of either of these investigations and is unable to estimate the financial impact they may have  or predict the reporting periods in which any such financial impacts may be recorded 
consequently  the company has not recorded a provision for loss as of december  with respect to either of these investigations 
also  since the company s plea agreement with the doj  involved the actions of employees of a japanese subsidiary  the japan fair trade commission is evaluating whether to initiate an investigation 
the company is also subject to civil litigation alleging anti competitive conduct 
notably  the company  several of its subsidiaries and its competitors are defendants in a total of twelve purported antitrust class action lawsuits  eleven of which are pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan brad zirulnik v
