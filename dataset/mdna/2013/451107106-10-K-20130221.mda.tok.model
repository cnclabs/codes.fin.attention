retail rates idaho power periodically evaluates the need to seek changes to its retail electricity price structure to cover its operating costs and provide an opportunity for a reasonable rate of return 
idaho power uses general rate cases  power cost adjustment pca mechanisms  a fixed cost adjustment fca  balancing accounts and riders  and subject specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and to earn a return on investment 
retail prices are determined through formal ratemaking proceedings that generally include testimony by participating parties  data requests  public hearings  and the issuance of a final order 
participants in these proceedings  which are conducted under established procedures and schedules  include idaho power  the staffs of the ipuc or opuc  and other interested parties 
the ipuc and opuc are required to ensure that the prices and terms of service are fair  non discriminatory  and provide idaho power an opportunity to recover its costs and earn a fair return on investment 
this requirement does not  however  ensure that idaho power will earn a specified rate of return 
in addition to general rate case filings  ratemaking proceedings can involve charges or credits related to specific costs  programs  or activities  as well as the recovery or refund of deferred amounts recorded pursuant to specific authorization from the ipuc or opuc 
deferred amounts are generally collected from  or refunded to  retail customers through the use of supplemental tariffs 
wholesale markets as a public utility under part ii of the federal power act fpa  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff oatt 
idaho power s oatt is revised each year based on financial and operational data idaho power files annually with the ferc in its form the energy policy act of granted the ferc increased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission and network reliability standards  as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmission markets  including protection against market manipulation 
these mandatory transmission and reliability standards were developed by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and the western electricity coordinating council wecc  which has responsibility for compliance and enforcement of transmission and reliability standards 
idaho power participates in the wholesale energy markets by purchasing power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands 
idaho power market activities are guided by a risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans  which are influenced by customer load  market prices  generating costs  transmission constraints  and availability of generating resources 
some of idaho power hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run hydroelectric generation units and when to store water in reservoirs 
these decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales 
even in below normal water years  there are opportunities to vary water usage to maximize generation unit efficiency  capture marketplace economic benefits  and meet load demand 
wholesale energy market prices and compliance factors  such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements  influence these dispatch decisions 
energy sales the following table presents idaho power s revenues and energy use by customer type for the last three years 
approximately percent of idaho power s general business revenue comes from customers located in idaho  with the remainder coming from customers located in oregon

idaho power s annual hydroelectric generation varies depending on water conditions in the snake river basin 
market purchases and sales are used to supplement idaho power generation and balance supply and demand throughout the year 
idaho power s generating plants and their capacities are listed in part i  item properties 
weather  load demand  and economic conditions impact power supply costs 
drought conditions and increased peak load demand cause a greater reliance on potentially more expensive energy sources to meet load requirements 
conversely  favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase production at idaho power s hydroelectric generating facilities and reduce the need for thermal generation and wholesale market purchased power 
economic conditions and governmental regulations can affect the market price of natural gas and coal  which may impact fuel expense and market prices for purchased power 
idaho power has pca mechanisms in idaho and oregon that mitigate in large part the potential adverse financial statement impacts of volatile fuel and power costs 
idaho power s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand was  mw  set on july   and the all time winter peak demand was  mw  set on december  during these and other similarly heavy load periods idaho power s system is fully committed to serve load and meet required operating reserves 
the following table presents idaho power s total power supply for the last three years 

table of contents mwh percent of total generation thousands of mwh hydroelectric plants coal fired plants natural gas fired plants total system generation purchased power cogeneration and small power production purchased power other total purchased power total power supply hydroelectric generation idaho power operates hydroelectric projects located on the snake river and its tributaries 
together  these hydroelectric facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of  mw and annual generation equal to approximately million mwh under median water conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall  amount and timing of water leases  and other weather and stream flow considerations 
power generation at the idaho power hydroelectric power plants on the snake river also depends on the state water rights held by idaho power and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows  and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
idaho power continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal to preserve  to the fullest extent possible  the long term availability of water for use at idaho power s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
for more information on water management issues see note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
during low water years  when stream flows into idaho power s hydroelectric projects are reduced  idaho power s hydroelectric generation is reduced  resulting in a reliance on other generation resources and power purchases 
below average snow accumulation in the snake river basin resulted in below average stream flow in as a consequence  annual generation from idaho power s hydroelectric facilities was million mwh lower in than in the northwest river forecast center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration reported that brownlee reservoir part of the hells canyon complex inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf 
by comparison  april through july brownlee reservoir inflow was maf in and maf in idaho power obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc  similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways 
the licensing process includes an extensive public review process and involves numerous natural resource and environmental issues 
the licenses last from to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
idaho power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex project  its largest hydroelectric generation source 
idaho power also has three oregon licenses under the oregon hydroelectric act  which applies to idaho power s brownlee  oxbow  and hells canyon facilities 
for further information on relicensing activities see part ii  item md a regulatory matters relicensing of hydroelectric projects 
idaho power is subject to the provisions of the fpa as a public utility and as a licensee by virtue of its hydroelectric operations 
as a licensee under part i of the fpa  idaho power and its licensed hydroelectric projects are subject to conditions described in the fpa and related ferc regulations 
these conditions and regulations include provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation  amortization of project investment from excess project earnings  possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment  severance damages  and other matters 
coal fired generation idaho power co owns the following coal fired power plants jim bridger located in wyoming  in which idaho power has a one third interest  valmy located in nevada  in which idaho power has a percent interest  and boardman located in oregon  in which idaho power has a percent interest 

table of contents idaho power  through its subsidiary ierco  owns a one third interest in bcc  which owns the jim bridger mine that supplies coal to the jim bridger power plant 
pacificorp operates both the jim bridger mine and the jim bridger power plant 
the mine  located near the jim bridger plant  operates under a long term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal over a year period ending in from surface  high wall  and underground sources 
idaho power believes that the jim bridger mine has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for at least the term of the sales agreement 
idaho power also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through from the black butte coal company s black butte mine located near the jim bridger plant 
this contract supplements the jim bridger mine deliveries and provides another coal supply to operate the jim bridger plant 
the jim bridger plant s rail load in facility and unit coal train provide the opportunity to access other fuel supplies for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums

the boardman generating plant receives coal through annual contracts with suppliers from the powder river basin in northeast wyoming 
portland general electric company is the operator of the boardman plant 
all of the boardman plant s projected coal requirements in and approximately percent of projected coal requirements in are under contract 
a portion of the and coal purchased will be low sulfur content as boardman prepares for the transition to a lower sulfur fuel content 
as a ten percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated to purchase ten percent of the coal obtained under these agreements 
in december  the oregon environmental quality commission approved a plan to cease coal fired operations at the boardman power plant not later than december  natural gas fired generation idaho power owns and operates the langley gulch natural gas fired combined cycle power plant and the danskin and bennett mountain natural gas fired simple cycle combustion turbine power plants 
all three plants are located in idaho 
the langley gulch power plant was placed into service in june  contributing to the notable increase in gas fired generation during relative to prior years 
idaho power operates the langley gulch plant as a base load unit and the danskin and bennett mountain plants to meet peak supply needs 
the plants are also used to take advantage of wholesale market opportunities 
natural gas for all facilities is purchased based on system requirements and dispatch efficiency 
the natural gas is transported through the williams northwest pipeline under idaho power  million british thermal units mmbtu per day long term gas transportation service agreements 
these transportation agreements vary in contract length  with the latest termination date of may  but with extensions at idaho power s discretion 
in addition to the long term gas transportation service agreements  idaho power has entered into a long term storage service agreement with northwest pipeline for  mmbtu of total storage capacity at the jackson prairie storage project 
this firm storage contract expires in idaho power purchases and stores natural gas with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for seasonal peaks or to meet system requirements 
as of december   approximately million mmbtu of natural gas was financially hedged for physical delivery for the operational dispatch of the langley gulch plant through december idaho power plans to manage the procurement of additional natural gas for the peaking units on the daily spot market or from storage inventory as necessary to meet system requirements and fueling strategies 
purchased power agreements idaho power purchases power in the wholesale market and pursuant to long term power purchase contracts  as described below 
wholesale market purchases idaho power purchases power in the wholesale market based on economics  operating reserve margins  risk management policy limitations  and unit availability 
idaho power seeks to manage its loads efficiently by utilizing its generation resources and long term power purchase contracts in conjunction with buying and selling opportunities in the wholesale market 
in addition to its market purchases  idaho power has the following notable firm wholesale power purchase contracts and energy exchange agreements raft river energy i  llc for up to mw nameplate generation from its raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho

purpa power purchase contracts idaho power purchases power from purpa projects as mandated by federal law 
as of december   idaho power had mw nameplate capacity of purpa related projects on line  with an additional mw nameplate capacity of projects projected to be on line by the end of the power purchase contracts for these projects have terms ranging from one to years 
the expense and volume of purpa project power purchases during the last three years is included in the table below 
year ended december  purpa contract expense in thousands mwh purchased under purpa contracts in thousands average cost per mwh from purpa contracts the bulk of the increase in volume of purpa power purchases resulted from additional wind projects 
pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the state regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over idaho power have each issued orders and rules regulating idaho power s purchase of power from qualifying facilities that meet the requirements of purpa 
a key component of the purpa contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements 
purpa regulations specify that a utility must pay energy prices based on the utility s avoided costs 
the ipuc and opuc have established specific rules and regulations to calculate the avoided cost that idaho power is required to include in purpa contracts 
for purpa power purchase agreements idaho power is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside its service territory  subject to some exceptions such as adverse impacts on system reliability 
idaho power is required to purchase the output of projects located outside its service territory if it has the ability to receive power at the facility s requested point of delivery on idaho power system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with purpa contracts is fully recovered through base rates and the pca  and the opuc jurisdictional portion is recovered through general rate case filings and an oregon pca mechanism 
ipuc and opuc jurisdictional regulations allow purpa standard contract terms to be up to years 
the ipuc requires idaho power to pay published avoided cost rates for all wind and solar projects that are smaller than kw and all other types of projects that are smaller than average mws 
for purpa qualifying facilities that exceed these size limitations  idaho power is required to negotiate an applicable price premised on avoided costs based upon ipuc regulations 
the opuc requires that idaho power pay the published avoided costs for all purpa qualifying facilities with a nameplate rating of mw or less and that idaho power negotiate an applicable price premised on avoided costs for all other qualifying facilities based upon opuc regulations 
idaho power  as well as other power utilities with an idaho service territory  has been engaged in proceedings at the ipuc and opuc relating to purpa contract terms  including the prices paid for energy purchased from purpa projects 
refer to md a regulatory matters renewable energy contracts  renewable energy certificates  and emission allowances for a summary of those proceedings 
transmission services electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generation facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers 
transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generation facilities can be 
table of contents located anywhere from a few miles to hundreds of miles from customers 
idaho power s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum capability and reliability 
idaho power s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the bonneville power administration  avista corporation  pacificorp  northwestern energy  and nv energy  inc these interconnections  coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of those entities  permit the interchange  purchase  and sale of power among entities in the western interconnection 
idaho power provides wholesale transmission service and provides firm and non firm wheeling services for eligible transmission customers 
idaho power is a member of the western electricity coordinating council  the northwest power pool  the northern tier transmission group  and the north american energy standards board 
these groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the western interconnection 
resource planning integrated resource plan the ipuc and opuc require that idaho power biennially prepare an integrated resource plan irp 
idaho power filed its irp with the ipuc and opuc in june the irp seeks to forecast idaho power loads and resources for a year period  analyzes potential supply side and demand side resource options  and identifies potential near term and long term actions 
the irp was accepted by the ipuc in december and acknowledged by the opuc in february the four primary goals of the irp are to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy within idaho power service area throughout the year planning period  ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost  risk  and environmental concerns  give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures  and involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way 
idaho power updates the irp every two years and preparation of the irp is in process 
idaho power expects that the irp will be completed and filed in june during the time between resource plan filings  the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the irp allows for discussion and adjustment of the irp as warranted 
idaho power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan to reflect changes in technology  economic conditions  anticipated resource development  and regulatory requirements 
the irp included as new generation resources the mw langley gulch natural gas fired power plant  which came on line in june  and a mw expansion of the shoshone falls hydroelectric facility  which is under evaluation and unlikely to be constructed prior to the irp also identified the boardman to hemingway transmission line in the preferred resource portfolio 
idaho power believes the boardman to hemingway transmission line and the existing hemingway substation  together with the gateway west transmission line  will improve reliability  relieve transmission congestion  and provide system flexibility 
additional information about idaho power significant infrastructure development projects is included in item md a liquidity and capital resources capital requirements major infrastructure projects 
preliminary work performed in connection with idaho power irp indicates more moderate load growth rates in idaho power service area than what was forecast in the irp 
the moderation in load growth is in large part the result of changes in expectations surrounding economic conditions  anticipated electricity price increases incorporating impacts of carbon legislation  loss of anticipated load from the hoku materials  inc special customer contract  and the elimination of an anticipated but unidentified special contract customer that had been included in the irp 
the irp median annual average load forecast projects growth of percent annually over the next years  whereas the irp included a forecast growth rate of percent 
for median peak hour load  the irp is expected to project an annual average growth rate of percent whereas the irp included a forecast growth rate of percent 
accounting for the reduced load growth and excluding approximately mw of demand response programs  the preliminary irp load and resource balance forecasts the first resource capacity deficit will not occur until the summer of under one scenario 
although the irp is projected to forecast lower load growth rates  there is still much uncertainty regarding the rate of recovery from the recession and the subsequent impact on idaho power future load growth 
idaho power expects to be able to manage any near term summer peak capacity deficits until completion of the boardman to hemingway transmission line  which is expected in at the earliest 
if the boardman to hemingway line is not constructed by the time necessary to meet load demands  idaho power will need to identify alternatives to meet load requirements 
in response to the operational challenges associated with integrating intermittent wind power that idaho power must purchase pursuant to purpa  and the recognition that the costs and challenges associated with integrating intermittent resources will become even more pronounced as the volume of intermittent resources in idaho power portfolio increases  idaho power 
table of contents continues efforts to better understand the effects of wind generation on power system operation 
as part of these efforts  idaho power issued its first wind integration study in  and in late completed a second  more comprehensive wind integration study 
the goal of the most recent study was to assess the additional costs incurred in modifying operations of idaho power dispatchable generating resources to compensate for the variable and intermittent energy supplied by wind generators while maintaining reliable energy delivery to customers 
additionally  the study aimed to provide insight on the maximum amount of wind generation idaho power system can accommodate without impacting reliability 
idaho power has committed considerable resources to the study  including working with an independent consultant  utility industry peers  and interested parties  and has held public workshops 
idaho power released the report publicly in february as part of its irp update 
in further response to the integration challenges  idaho power has implemented an internally developed wind forecasting system  in recognition that cost intensive modifications to operations intended to integrate wind are reduced  though not eliminated  with improved wind production forecasting 
on or before january   idaho power is required to own or contract to purchase the capacity and output from a qualifying solar photovoltaic pv system with a minimum capacity of kw pursuant to the state of oregon solar pv capacity standard 
the timing of development of this required project in oregon and the solar demonstration project referenced in idaho power irp will depend in large part on idaho power ability to resolve integration  reliability  and cost issues associated with the recent influx of purpa resources from which idaho power is currently mandated to purchase power 
however  with the cost of solar pv technology continuing to decrease  idaho power believes this technology will become more prevalent in its service area over the long term 
idaho power continues to evaluate the timing for proceeding with solar pv technology 
energy efficiency and demand response programs idaho power has energy efficiency and demand response programs targeting energy savings across the entire year and summer system demand reduction 
these programs are offered to all customer segments and emphasize the wise use of energy  especially during periods of high demand 
this energy and demand reduction can minimize or delay the need for new infrastructure 
idaho power s programs include financial incentives for irrigation customers for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing new energy efficient systems  energy efficiency for new and existing homes  including efficient appliances and hvac equipment  energy efficient building techniques  insulation improvement  air duct sealing  and energy efficient lighting  incentives to industrial and commercial customers for acquiring energy efficient equipment  and using energy efficiency techniques for operational and management processes  and demand response programs to reduce peak summer demand through the voluntary interruption of central air conditioners for residential customers  interruption of irrigation pumps  and reduction of commercial and industrial demand through a third party demand response aggregator 
in  idaho power s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately  mwh 
idaho power demand response programs had available capacity of approximately mw  however  because of a relatively high cost to dispatch idaho power irrigation peak rewards program it was not used in idaho power realized approximately mw in summer peak demand reduction through the a c cool credit and the flexpeak management programs as these programs have no marginal dispatch costs 
in december  idaho power filed with the ipuc to temporarily suspend the a c cool credit and irrigation peak rewards programs for the summer of in order to work with stakeholders and ipuc staff to explore the near term need for and design of the demand response programs 
a settlement stipulation relating to temporary suspension of the programs is pending before the ipuc 
in  idaho power spent approximately million on energy efficiency and targeted demand reduction response programs 
approximately million annually of funding for these programs is provided by idaho and oregon energy efficiency tariff riders  while the balance of the funding comes from idaho power base rates and the pca mechanism 
in  as approved by the ipuc  idaho power capitalized approximately million of custom efficiency program incentives as a regulatory asset 
for expenditures in  idaho power will also recover approximately million in demand response incentives through its annual pca as approved by the ipuc 
approximately million of idaho power s energy efficiency spending was related to research and analysis  education  technology evaluation  and market transformation 
most of this activity was done in conjunction with the northwest energy efficiency alliance 

table of contents environmental regulation and costs idaho power activities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  regional  and local laws and regulations designed to protect  restore  and enhance the quality of the environment 
environmental regulation continues to impact idaho power s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with environmental regulations  and the modification of system operations to accommodate environmental regulations 
in addition to generally applicable regulations  the ferc licenses issued for idaho power s hydroelectric generating plants have environmental requirements such as aeration of turbine water to meet dissolved gas and temperature standards in the tail waters downstream from the plants 
idaho power monitors these issues and reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
idaho power three coal fired power plants and three natural gas combustion turbine power plants are also subject to a broad range of environmental requirements  including air quality regulation 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other environmental issues  refer to item md a environmental matters in this report 
cost estimates idaho power s environmental compliance expenditures will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future  especially with potential additional regulation under discussion at the federal level 
idaho power estimates its environmental expenditures  based upon present environmental laws and regulations  will be as follows for the periods indicated  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc in millions of dollars environmental expenditures capital expenditures studies and measures at hydroelectric facilities investments in equipment and facilities at thermal plants total capital expenditures operating expenses operating costs for environmental facilities hydroelectric operating costs for environmental facilities thermal total operations and maintenance idaho power anticipates that a number of new and impending epa rulemakings and proceedings addressing  among other things  ozone and fine particulate matter pollution  emissions  and disposal of coal combustion residuals could result in substantially increased operating and compliance costs in addition to the amounts set forth above  but idaho power is unable to estimate those costs given the uncertainty associated with pending regulations 
environmental controls cost study in connection with its irp process  idaho power has been conducting cost studies and scenario analyses to assess the potential future investments necessary for the continued operation of the jim bridger and valmy coal fired generation facilities 
the boardman plant was not included in the study because of the existing schedule to cease coal fired operations at that plant by the end of some of the future environmental control requirements for the jim bridger and valmy plants are known  however  additional requirements could arise from future regulations 
in the analysis  the cost of future compliance was compared to the cost of replacement generation capacity provided by combined cycle combustion turbine technology and conversion of the units to natural gas 
because of the speculative nature of many of the future requirements  the analysis was performed under a range of fuel pricing assumptions  carbon cost assumptions  plant upgrade and retirement costs  environmental regulation assumptions  and replacement costs 
idaho power published the results of the study with its irp update filed with the ipuc and opuc in february idaho power concluded in its study that the jim bridger and valmy plants should be retained in its resource portfolio and supports planned investments in environmental controls at those plants 
this is particularly true in light of the desire to maintain a diversified portfolio of generation assets and fuel diversity that can mitigate risk associated with increases in natural gas prices 
however  the study also concluded that in the event significant additional operating and maintenance or capital expenditures are necessary at the valmy plant as a result of new environmental requirements  idaho power will conduct a further review to determine whether such investments are economically appropriate  and whether conversion of the facility to a natural gas fired plant would be appropriate 
inaugural sustainability report in may  idacorp publicly issued its inaugural sustainability report 
the sustainability report highlights idaho power continuing efforts to operate in a manner that supports financial  environmental  and social stewardship 
idacorp plans to issue its second sustainability report in may and make it available on its or idaho power website 

table of contents extension of idaho power voluntary co intensity reduction goal while there is currently no national mandatory greenhouse gas reduction requirement  idaho power continues to prepare for potential legislative and or regulatory restrictions on emissions in order to help reduce the costs of complying with such restrictions on its customers 
to that end  idaho power is engaged in voluntary greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction efforts 
in september  idacorp and idaho power boards of directors approved guidelines that established a goal to reduce idaho power resource portfolio average carbon dioxide co emission intensity for the through time period to a level of to percent below idaho power co emission intensity of  lbs co mwh 
idaho power estimated co emission intensity from its generation facilities  as submitted to the carbon disclosure project  was   and  lbs mwh for   and respectively 
as of the date of this report  idaho power is on track to exceed the co emission intensity reduction goal it established in the combination of effective utilization of hydroelectric projects  above average stream flows  reduced usage of coal fired facilities  and addition of the langley gulch natural gas fired power plant have positioned idaho power to extend its co intensity reduction goal period for an additional two years  targeting an average reduction of to percent below its levels for the entire through time period

the prices that the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission authorize idaho power to charge for its retail services  and the tariff rate that the federal energy regulatory commission permits idaho power to charge for its transmission services  are generally the most significant factors influencing idacorp s and idaho power s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred 
also  the rates allowed by the federal energy regulatory commission for transmission service may be insufficient for recovery of costs incurred 
the regulatory process does not assure that idaho power will be able to achieve the rate of return allowed by the idaho and oregon public utility commissions 
further  while the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission are required to establish rates that are fair  just  and reasonable  they have considerable discretion in applying this standard 
the ratemaking process typically involves multiple parties  including governmental bodies  consumer advocacy groups  and customers 
while each party has differing concerns  they often have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates 
idaho power cannot predict the outcome of ratemaking proceedings  including what rates of return will be authorized  the extent to which costs will be allowed for recovery  or the timing of recovery 
the failure of idaho power to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities to recover costs  construct new generating or transmission facilities  install environmental emission control equipment  or otherwise operate idaho power business may adversely impact idaho power ability to achieve its strategic plan  cause idacorp and idaho power to record an impairment of their assets  and have a material adverse impact on their results of operations and financial condition 
in a number of proceedings in recent years  idaho power has been denied recovery  or deferred recovery pending the next general rate case  including denials or deferrals related to compensation expenses and construction expenditures 
for additional information relating to idaho power regulatory framework and recent matters  see item business utility operations  note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  and item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory matters in this report 
idaho power cost recovery deferral mechanisms may not function as intended  which may adversely affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its idaho and oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in idaho that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its retail customers 
the power cost adjustment mechanisms track idaho power s actual net power supply costs primarily fuel and purchased power less off system sales and compares these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates 
a majority  but not all  of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from  or refund to  customers through rates 
consequently  the power cost adjustment mechanisms only partially offset the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages  severe weather  reduced hydroelectric generation  and volatile wholesale energy prices 
because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms  the primary financial impact of power 
table of contents supply cost variations is on the timing of cash flows 
when costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates it adversely affects idaho power s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers 
unanticipated changes in loads in idaho power s service territory expose idaho power to market and operational risk and could increase costs and adversely affect idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
while idaho power s customer growth rate has slowed in recent years  idaho power believes its service territory is an attractive one for both businesses and individuals 
idaho power has recently adjusted its load forecast as part of its integrated resource planning process  predicting a lower growth rate over its year resource planning horizon compared to prior estimates 
in its efforts to balance loads and resources  idaho power makes load estimates that are based on a number of factors that are uncertain and difficult to estimate  and any unanticipated increase in the demand for energy could result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet peak system demand  the need to reinstate or initiate new demand response and energy efficiency programs  or the need for investment in additional generation resources 
if the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue and idaho power is unable to secure timely rate relief to recover those costs  the resulting disconnect between the time costs are incurred or investments are made and the time costs are recovered could have an adverse effect on idacorp or idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
national and regional economic conditions may reduce customer growth rates  reduce energy consumption  or cause increased late payments and uncollectible customer accounts  which would adversely affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
beginning in  economic conditions in idaho power s service area have been relatively weak 
weak economic conditions may reduce the amount of energy idaho power s customers consume  result in a loss of customers including large load industrial and commercial customers or further decrease the customer growth rate  and increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts 
a resulting decrease in overall customer usage or collections and load growth at a rate less than anticipated may alter capital spending plans and rate base growth and may reduce revenues  earnings  and cash flows 
also  idaho power regulatory mechanisms  including its load change adjustment rate and fixed cost adjustment mechanism in idaho  are unlikely to result in idaho power recovering all of its costs related to load decreases  which would have a negative impact on idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
extreme weather events and their associated impacts  such as high winds and fires  whether as a result of climate change or otherwise  can adversely affect idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
extreme weather events can damage generation facilities and disrupt transmission and distribution systems  causing service interruptions and extended outages  increasing supply chain costs  and limiting idaho power ability to meet customer energy demand 
disruption in generation  transmission  and distribution systems due to weather related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses and could negatively affect idacorp and idaho power results of operation and financial condition 
new advances in power generation  energy efficiency  or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could cause an erosion in revenues 
with the escalating costs of energy has come the incentive for the development of new technologies for power generation and energy efficiency  and an investment in research and development to make those technologies more efficient and cost effective 
for instance  while solar technology remains a relatively high cost means of power generation  there have been numerous recent advancements in the design of solar generation facilities and the materials used in panels for example  copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon 
these advancements may further increase the efficiency and power output of solar generation sources 
considerable emphasis has also been placed on energy efficiency and products that reduce electricity usage  such as led lighting 
there is potential that power generation systems provided by third parties  whether solar generation or otherwise  and energy efficiency measures could become sufficiently cost effective and efficient that customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses 
this may render traditional generation sources owned by idaho power obsolete or decrease the need for energy supplied by idaho power  which would reduce idaho power revenue and have a negative impact on idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
capital expenditures for power generation and delivery infrastructure and replacement of that infrastructure  and the timing and availability of cost recovery for those expenditures  can significantly affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation  transmission  and distribution infrastructure 
long term increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure 
for instance  idaho power is in the permitting process for two kv transmission line projects 
construction projects are subject to usual construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and completion time 
these risks include the ability to obtain labor or materials  increases in cost of labor and materials  contractor defaults  equipment  engineering  and design failures  adverse weather conditions  lack of availability of financing  the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights  environmental constraints  
table of contents disputes and litigation with third parties  and changes in applicable laws or regulations 
if idaho power is unable to complete the construction of a project  or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent  it may not be able to recover its costs in full through rates 
even if idaho power completes a construction project  the total costs may be higher than estimated and or higher than amounts approved for recovery by regulators 
if idaho power does not receive timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with those expansion and reinforcement activities  idaho power will have to rely more heavily on external debt or equity financing for its future capital expenditures 
these large capital expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of idacorp and idaho power 
additionally  a significant portion of idaho power s facilities were constructed many years ago  which could affect reliability  increase repair and maintenance expenses  and increase reliance on market purchases of power  which may negatively affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
further  if idaho power were unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads  such as the boardman to hemingway transmission line  it may terminate those projects and  as an alternative  develop additional generation facilities within areas where idaho power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads 
termination of a project carries with it the potential for a write off of all or a significant portion of the costs associated with the project if state public utility commissions deny recovery of costs they deem imprudently incurred  which could negatively affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power s business is subject to an extensive set of environmental laws  rules  and regulations  which could impact idaho power operations and increase costs of operations  potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate  and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects 
a number of federal  state  and local environmental statutes  rules  and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources  and health and safety are applicable to idaho power operations 
these laws and regulations generally require idaho power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections  and other approvals  and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals 
some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation  and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences 
environmental regulations have created the need for idaho power to install new pollution control equipment at  and may cause idaho power to perform environmental remediation on  its owned or co owned facilities  often at a substantial cost 
for instance  idaho power plans to install environmental control apparatus at its co owned jim bridger power plant in and at a cost of approximately million  and a second set of control apparatus in and idaho power expects that there will be other costs relating to environmental regulations  and those costs are likely to be substantial 
idaho power is not guaranteed recovery of those costs 
for instance  in december the oregon public utility commission disallowed in part cost recovery for certain environmental upgrades made to a coal plant by one of idaho power northwest region peer utilities  citing an insufficient cost analysis 
if idaho power is similarly unable to recover in full its costs through the ratemaking process  such non recovery would negatively impact idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  there are many legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal and state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel plant emissions 
idaho power cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals  or the compliance costs idaho power would incur in connection with that legislation 
future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reduction may make certain electric generating units especially coal fired units uneconomical and subject to shut down  may require the adoption of new methodologies or technologies that significantly increase costs or delay in service dates  and may raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
furthermore  idaho power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its facilities and execution of its long term strategy  including construction of new transmission and distribution infrastructure 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if idaho power fails to obtain  maintain  or comply with any such approval  construction and or operation of idaho power generation or transmission facilities could be delayed  halted  or subjected to additional costs 
at the same time  consumer preference for renewable or low greenhouse gas emitting sources of energy could impact the desirability of generation from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources 
relicensing of the hells canyon hydroelectric project and construction of the proposed gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines requires consultation under the endangered species act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas 
the listing of species as threatened or endangered will result in a costly endangered species act consultation for the two transmission projects and for any future transmission projects 
similarly  the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission projects has required more extensive  costly  and time consuming evaluation and engineering 
these and other requirements of the endangered 
table of contents species act  clean air act  clean water act  and similar environmental laws may increase costs  the timing or ability to complete major projects  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities 
because of idaho power s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  snowpack  the timing of run off  and the availability of water in the snake river basin can significantly affect its operations 
the combination of declining snake river base flows  over appropriation of water  and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the state of idaho 
recharging the eastern snake plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the over appropriation dispute 
diversions from the snake river for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights may further reduce snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power  therefore  costs increase and opportunities for off system sales are reduced  reducing earnings 
through its power cost adjustment mechanisms  idaho power expects to recover most of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation 
recovery of the increased costs  however  may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year  negatively affecting cash flows and liquidity 
conditions imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures  increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric generation  and negatively affect idacorp or idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
for the last several years  idaho power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source  the hells canyon complex 
relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions 
the listing of various species of marine life  wildlife  and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally authorized activities  including those of hydroelectric projects 
in particular  fish and other marine life recovery plans may require major operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects 
in addition  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities  which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet idaho power s energy requirements 
in  the federal energy regulatory commission staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the hells canyon complex  which the federal energy regulatory commission will use in part to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the hells canyon complex 
certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under section of the clean water act and formal consultations under the endangered species act  which remain unresolved 
one significant issue involves water temperature gradients  and certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which  if required to be installed  would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain 
idaho power may be unable to recover in full the costs of such an apparatus through rates  particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates 
idaho power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process  the financial impact of those requirements  or whether a new multi year license will ultimately be issued 
imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in idaho power incurring significant capital expenditures  increase operating costs  and reduce hydroelectric generation  which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition 
idacorp and idaho power operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations  and unusually mild temperatures can impact their results of operations and financial condition 
electric power sales are generally seasonal  with demand in idaho power service territory peaking during the hot summer months  with a secondary peak during the cold winter months 
the loads required by irrigation customers in idaho power service territory can also create significant seasonal changes in usage 
when temperatures are relatively mild  loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning purposes 
thus  unusually mild weather or the timing and extent of precipitation in the future could adversely impact idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
complying with state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and adversely affect idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
a number of states have adopted renewable portfolio standards  which require that electricity providers obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources by a specified date 
idaho power s operations in oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable portfolio standard beginning in  and it is possible that other states  including idaho  could adopt renewable portfolio standards 
the cost of purchasing or generating power from renewable energy sources is often greater than 
table of contents fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation sources  and construction of renewable energy facilities involves significant capital expenditures 
as a result  new state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and negatively affect results of operations and financial condition 
idaho power s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its non hydroelectric power generation facilities exposes it to the risk of increased costs and reduced earnings 
as part of its normal business operations  idaho power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short term  long term  or variable priced contracts 
market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions  fuel transportation availability  economic conditions  and changes in technology 
most of idaho power coal supply arrangements are for coal originating in wyoming and any disruption of coal production in  or transportation from  that region may cause idaho power to incur additional fuel supply costs or use alternative generation sources or wholesale market power purchases 
natural gas transportation to idaho power natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline  presenting a heightened possibility of supply disruptions 
idaho power is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to fuel purchase arrangements will default on their obligations  causing idaho power to seek alternative sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases 
idaho power may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through rates or its power cost adjustment mechanisms  which may adversely affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power s generation  transmission  and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry 
operating risks associated with idaho power generation  transmission  and distribution facilities include equipment failures  volatility in fuel and transportation pricing  interruptions in fuel supplies  increased regulatory compliance costs  labor disputes  accidents and workforce safety matters  release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air or water  the failure of a hydroelectric facility  the loss of cost effective disposal options for solid waste  operator error  and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities 
diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction and regulatory inquiries and fines 
operation of idaho power owned and co owned generating stations below expected capacity levels  or unplanned outages at these stations  could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases 
accidents  fires  explosions  system damage or dysfunction  and other unplanned events related to idaho power infrastructure may expose idaho power to claims for personal injury or property damage 
further  the transmission system in idaho power service territory is constrained  limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service territory and access electric energy from outside the service territory during high load periods 
the transmission constraints could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid  or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy  which could have a negative effect on idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
volatility in the financial markets  or denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities  may negatively affect idacorp s and idaho power s ability to access capital and or increase their cost of borrowing  or result in losses on investments 
idacorp and idaho power require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of  and interest on  debt and to finance capital expenditures not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
financial markets have in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption  most recently as a result of the european sovereign debt situation  generally resulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers 
in a volatile credit environment  idaho power may be unable to issue long term indebtedness at reasonable interest rates or at all  one or more of the participating banks in idacorp s and idaho power s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under  or may withdraw from  the credit facilities  or idacorp s and idaho power s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited 
in addition  at times idaho power has a relatively large balance of short term investments 
volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short term investments and declines in value of some investments 
the occurrence of any of these events could affect idaho power ability to execute its business plan and adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power s results of operations and financial condition 
further  idaho power is required to obtain regulatory approval in idaho  oregon  and wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations 
notably  without additional approval from those commissions  the aggregate amount of short term borrowings by idaho power at any one time outstanding may not exceed million 
a downgrade in idacorp s and idaho power s credit ratings could affect the companies ability to access capital  increase their cost of borrowing  and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
access to capital markets is important to idacorp and idaho power ability to operate and to complete capital projects  including its planned transmission projects 
credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp and idaho power  and these ratings impact access to  and the cost of  borrowing 
idacorp and idaho power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper  a principal source 
table of contents of short term financing 
downgrades of idacorp s or idaho power s credit ratings  or those affecting relationship banks  could limit the companies ability to access capital  including commercial paper markets  require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt  and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties 
idaho power s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging power and gas exposures  financial and interest rate risk  and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended  and as a result idacorp and idaho power may suffer economic losses 
idaho power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal  natural gas  power  and other commodities  and enters into financial hedges 
idacorp and idaho power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform 
the derivative instruments might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended  due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments  and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses 
further  forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause idaho power to over or under hedge actual resource needs  exposing the company to market risk on the over or under hedged position 
as a result  risk management actions may adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power s financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements  which could adversely impact idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
as an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system  idaho power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the federal energy regulatory commission 
the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles 
compliance with reliability standards subjects idaho power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures 
further  idaho power has received in recent years notices of violations from  and self reported reliability standard compliance issues to  the federal energy regulatory commission  the north american electric reliability corporation  and the western electricity coordinating council  and has several matters pending 
potential monetary and non monetary penalties for a violation of federal energy regulatory commission regulations may be substantial  and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as million per day per violation 
the imposition of penalties on idaho power could have a negative effect on its and idacorp s results of operations and financial condition 
federally mandated purchases of power from purpa power projects  and integration of power generated from those projects into idaho power system  may increase costs and decrease system reliability  and adversely affect idaho power and idacorp results of operations and financial condition 
an abundance of intermittent  non dispatchable wind power generation at times when idaho power has available lower cost resources to meet load demands has an impact on the operation of idaho power hydroelectric generation plants  system reliability  power supply costs  and the wholesale power markets in the pacific northwest 
wind power generated from purpa projects  which idaho power is generally obligated to purchase regardless of the then current load demand or wholesale energy market prices  increases the likelihood and frequency that idaho power will be required to reduce output from its lower cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel fired generation resources  increasing power purchase costs 
further  balancing load and generation from idaho power power generation portfolio is challenging  and idaho power expects that its operational costs will increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent  non dispatchable power from a large number of purpa power projects 
recent efforts to obtain further authorization to curtail certain intermittent power sources during light load times have been unsuccessful 
idaho power anticipates that costs will escalate as the volume of wind and other intermittent power on idaho power system increases  which may negatively affect idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
the performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations primarily cash flows and liquidity 
idaho power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan consisting of health care and death benefits that covers eligible retirees 
costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans assets and  therefore  adverse investment performance for these assets could increase idaho power s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
idaho power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends  and future expectations 
estimates of future equity and debt market performance  changes in interest rates  and other factors idaho power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
changes in demographics  including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions  may also increase idaho power plan costs and funding requirements 
future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation 
depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and idaho power ability to recover costs through 
table of contents rates  cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for operating activities 
for additional information regarding idaho power funding obligations under its benefit plans  see note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as a holding company  idacorp does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments 
idacorp is a holding company with no significant operations of its own  and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries  primarily idaho power 
idacorp s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to idacorp  whether through dividends  loans  or other payments 
the ability of idacorp s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to idacorp depends on several factors  including each subsidiary actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition  regulatory restrictions  covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties  and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities 
further  the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors  which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time 
see item market for registrant common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities in this report for a further description of restrictions on idacorp and idaho power payment of dividends 
changes in tax laws and regulations  or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions  could have a material adverse impact on idacorp s or idaho power s financial condition and results of operations 
idacorp and idaho power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes 
the companies tax obligations include income  real estate  public utility  municipal  sales and use  business and occupation  and employment related taxes and ongoing issues related to these taxes 
these judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities 
in recent years  tax settlements  as well as state regulatory mechanisms with tax related provisions such as idaho power december settlement with the idaho public utilities commission  have significantly impacted idacorp and idaho power results of operations 
the outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings  or the state public utility commissions treatment of those tax outcomes  could differ materially from the amounts idacorp and idaho power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings  and the difference could negatively affect idacorp s and idaho power s earnings and cash flows 
further  in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than idacorp or idaho power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions  which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations 
employee workforce factors  including the impacts of an aging workforce with specialized utility specific functions  could increase costs and adversely affect idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power is subject to workforce factors  including loss or retirement of key personnel  availability of qualified personnel  an aging workforce  and impacts of efforts to organize the workforce 
a unionization attempt that was launched in late failed  but does not prevent future unionization attempts 
idaho power s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions 
many of these positions  such as linemen  grid operators  and generation plant operators  require extensive  specialized training 
idaho power expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring within the current decade  which will require idaho power to attract  train  and retain skilled workers to prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap 
without a skilled workforce  idaho power s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenging  which could negatively affect earnings 
the costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idacorp and idaho power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings  disputes  and claims 
from time to time in the normal course of business idacorp and idaho power are subject to various lawsuits  regulatory proceedings  disputes  and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions  or other relief 
these matters are subject to a number of uncertainties  and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter 
as an example  over the past decade idaho power has been a party to proceedings relating to high prices for electricity  energy shortages  and blackouts in california and in western wholesale markets during and  which caused numerous purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds or other forms of relief and the federal energy regulatory commission to initiate its own investigations 
while idaho power has largely disposed of direct claims in those proceedings  the settlements and associated federal energy regulatory commission orders did not eliminate the potential for speculative ripple claims  which involve potential claims for refunds from an upstream seller of power based on a finding that its downstream buyer was liable for refunds as a seller of power during the relevant period 
idaho power settlement payments in those proceedings have been relatively small to date  but the legal costs of defending the claims over the past decade have been substantial 
in recent years  idaho power has also been a party to legal proceedings advanced by private 
table of contents parties relating to alleged violations of environmental laws at coal fired plants 
the legal costs and final resolution of matters in which idacorp or idaho power are involved could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their business practices and procedures  which could also have a negative affect on their financial positions and results of operations 
acts or threats of terrorism  cyber attacks  security breaches  and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt idaho power operations  or the businesses of third parties  could negatively impact idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power generation and transmission facilities are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats  as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups 
some of idaho power facilities are deemed critical infrastructure  in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security  reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system  national economic security  national public health or safety  or any combination of those matters 
the possibility that infrastructure facilities  such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities  would be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or cyber attack whether originating internally or externally may affect idaho power operations by limiting the ability to generate  purchase  or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating and transmission facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities 
these events  and governmental actions in response  could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure idaho power assets  and could further adversely affect idaho power operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas or coal used to fuel gas or coal fired power plants 
in the normal course of business  idaho power collects  processes  and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietary information  and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in the electric grid 
despite the security measures in place  idaho power facilities and systems could be vulnerable to security breaches  data leakage  or other similar events that could interrupt operations  exposing idaho power to liability 
those breaches and events may result from acts of idaho power employees  contractors  or third parties 
if idaho power information technology and security systems were to fail or be breached and idaho power were unable to recover the systems and or data in a timely manner  idaho power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions 
in such case  confidential and proprietary business  employee  or customer information could be compromised  exposing idaho power to liability and causing business disruptions  which could negatively affect idaho power business operations and idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
idaho power business and operations may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully implement current information technology projects 
idaho power is currently undertaking several multi year company wide information technology solution upgrades intended to replace existing software and systems 
these projects include a new customer information system  idaho power smartgrid initiative  and migration from idaho power existing mainframe system to an open system 
idaho power is also implementing systems to augment and improve its ability to pinpoint the sources of electric system outages  respond to them more quickly  and focus repair efforts 
implementation of these information systems and technology solutions is complex  expensive  and time consuming 
if idaho power does not successfully implement the new systems and processes  or if the systems do not operate as intended or cause data or operational errors  it could result in substantial disruptions to idaho power business  which could have a material adverse effect on idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards or securities and exchange commission rules may impact idacorp and idaho power financial results and disclosures 
the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations 
further  new accounting orders issued by the federal energy regulatory commission could significantly impact idacorp and idaho power reported financial condition 
idaho power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates  and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities 
idaho power expects to recover its regulatory assets from customers through rates but recovery is subject to review by the regulatory bodies 
if recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable  if idaho power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting  or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities  idaho power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities 
any of these circumstances could result in write offs and have a material effect on idacorp and idaho power s reported financial condition and results of operations

idacorp is a holding company formed in whose principal operating subsidiary is idaho power 
idacorp s common stock is listed and trades on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol ida 
idaho power is an electric utility with a service territory covering approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
idaho power provided electric service to approximately  general business customers as of december  as a regulated utility  many of idaho power fundamental business decisions are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
idaho power is under the retail jurisdiction as to rates  service  accounting  and other general matters of utility operation of the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc  which determine the rates that idaho power charges to its general business customers 
also  as a public utility under the federal power act  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its federal energy regulatory commission ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its ferc open access transmission tariff oatt 
idaho power uses general rate cases  cost adjustment mechanisms  and subject specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and the costs of its energy efficiency and demand side resources programs  and to seek to earn a return on investment 
idaho power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its idaho and oregon service territories  as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity 
idaho power s revenues and income from operations are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on demand for electricity  availability of water for hydroelectric generation  price changes  customer usage patterns which are affected in large part by the condition of the local economy  and the availability and price of purchased power and fuel 
idaho power experiences its highest retail energy sales during the summer irrigation and cooling season  with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand 
idacorp s and idaho power s financial condition are also affected by regulatory decisions through which idaho power seeks to recover its costs on a timely basis and earn an authorized return on investment  and by the ability to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
idacorp s other subsidiaries include idacorp financial services  inc ifs  an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments  ida west energy company  an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  and idacorp energy services co  which is the former limited partner of  and successor by merger to  idacorp energy lp  a marketer of energy commodities that wound down operations in idaho power is the parent of idaho energy resources co

table of contents executive overview brief overview of results idacorp earnings per diluted share of were one cent above its earnings per diluted share of and reflect the impacts of general rate increases that went into effect during and and increased irrigation sales volumes 
idaho power return on year end equity in the idaho jurisdiction exceeded percent  triggering the sharing mechanism in idaho power december settlement agreement  discussed below  and resulting in a million reduction to operating income  reflecting earnings to be shared with idaho customers to reduce rates 
for purposes of comparison  during idacorp earnings were significantly impacted by the recognition of million in tax benefits relating to prior tax years 
the tax benefit  combined with operating results  triggered a similar sharing mechanism in idaho during that reduced operating income by million 
a more specific discussion of the factors influencing idacorp and idaho power results for  including a quantification of their respective impacts  is included below in this md a 
accomplishments and initiatives idacorp s business strategy emphasizes idaho power as idacorp s core business 
for the past several years  idaho power has been implementing its three part strategy of responsible planning  responsible development and protection of resources  and responsible energy use to ensure adequate energy supplies 
this strategy is described in part i  item business of this report 
examples of idaho power achievements during under its three part business strategy include commencement of the langley gulch power plant commercial operation  ahead of schedule and within budget  continued execution of idaho power purposeful regulatory strategy  which resulted in approval of idaho power requests for recovery of  and a return on  idaho power investment in the langley gulch power plant  a general rate increase in idaho on january   and the issuance of an order by the ipuc pertaining to purpa related matters  continued progress toward the permitting of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission projects and execution of associated cost sharing agreements with pacificorp and the bonneville power administration bpa  continued progress toward achieving idacorp previously adopted dividend policy  during the idacorp board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend twice  resulting in an aggregate increase from per share quarterly to per share quarterly  or nearly percent  receipt of a year license from the ferc for the continued operation of the swan falls hydroelectric facility  ranking in the top quartile of the largest utilities in the country for customer satisfaction in the jd power and associates electric utility residential customer satisfaction study  recognition for highest customer satisfaction with business electric service in the western us among midsize utilities in a tie in the jd power and associates electric utility business customer satisfaction study of more than utility brands across the us  and ranking among the best energy companies by public utilities fortnightly 
one of management primary goals during and was to reduce idaho power regulatory lag  which results from the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and earning a return and recovering that investment or expense 
management focused heavily on implementation of new rates and approval of regulatory mechanisms during and as idaho power transitions to and into it will focus on optimizing operations and managing growth in expenses in an effort to achieve or exceed a rate of return reflective of those allowed by the ipuc and opuc 
management anticipates that the idacorp board of directors will  when appropriate  take steps during in furtherance of the dividend policy it adopted in november  which provides for a target long term dividend payout ratio of between and percent of sustainable idacorp earnings 
other specific matters that the companies expect will require management focus and attention in include continued efforts toward permitting of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission projects  completion and filing of the integrated resource plan irp  implementation of a significant new customer relations and billing system  and continued work toward federal relicensing of the hells canyon complex hcc hydroelectric facility 
for  in addition to its specific projects  idaho power has established a number of organizational initiatives  including the following actively manage through the challenging economic environment by optimizing business practices  maintaining capital liquidity  and maintaining credit ratings  continue to emphasize innovative approaches to regulatory strategy  
table of contents promote economic development through collaboration with the states of idaho and oregon to attract new businesses that fit idaho power resource and load profile mix  focus on operational excellence by matching resources to customer loads  managing the impacts of environmental regulations  maintaining idaho power hydroelectric base  enhancing power quality and reliability  and customer satisfaction  and maintain an enterprise safety culture and an effective and motivated workforce  address workforce attrition  and enhance succession planning and training programs in anticipation of a significant number of retirements in the next few years 
overview of general factors and trends affecting results of operations and financial condition idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition are affected by regulatory  economic  and other factors  many of which are described below 
emphasis on regulatory cost recovery and expense management  support from regulatory settlement the price that idaho power is authorized to charge for its electric service is a critical factor in determining idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition 
because of the significant impact of ratemaking decisions  and in furtherance of its goal of advancing a purposeful regulatory strategy  idaho power has focused on timely recovery of its costs through filings with the company regulators  and the prudent management of expenses and investments after receiving rate orders from the ipuc and opuc 
effective implementation of idaho power regulatory strategy is particularly important in a climate of slow economic recovery that continues to put pressure on regulators to limit rate increases or otherwise take actions to limit the potential adverse impact of rate increases on customers 
the number of regulatory filings and activity during the period from to exceeded historical averages  driven by idaho power regulatory strategy 
the rate orders idaho power has received in recent years and their associated mechanisms have decreased the likelihood that idaho power would seek rate relief through a general revenue rate case during  and instead focus on optimizing business operations and processes 
particularly notable regulatory developments that have impacted or that idacorp and idaho power expect will impact results  each of which is discussed in more detail under regulatory matters in this md a or in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  include the following proceeding description amount and timing of rate increase decrease idaho general rate case settlement general rate case  requesting an increase in idaho jurisdiction base rates ipuc approved a million increase in rates  effective january  langley gulch power plant request for recovery of and return on idaho power investment in the langley gulch power plant  including operating costs ipuc approved a million increase in rates  effective july   opuc approved a million increase in rates effective october revenue sharing rate adjustment pursuant to january and december settlement agreements ipuc approved a million decrease in rates  effective only for the period from june  to may  oregon general rate case settlement general rate case  requesting an increase in oregon jurisdiction base rates opuc approved a million increase in rates  effective march  the rate change for the idaho pca was partially offset by the revenue sharing order issued pursuant to the january and december settlement agreements 
idaho power revenue sharing arrangements had two components a a pca mechanism component  which reduced net rates by million  and b a pension balancing account component  which resulted in a million net reduction to idaho power pension regulatory asset reducing idaho customers future obligation 
idaho power recorded the million revenue reduction and million pension regulatory asset reduction in in addition to the rate changes listed in the table above  in december the ipuc approved a settlement stipulation  separate from the idaho general rate case settlement  that permits idaho power to amortize additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc to help achieve a minimum percent rate of return on year end equity in the idaho jurisdiction idaho roe in   and  subject to prescribed limits and conditions 
the settlement stipulation also provides for the potential sharing between the company and customers of idaho jurisdictional earnings in excess of specified levels of idaho roe 
the specific terms of the settlement stipulation are described in regulatory matters in this md a and in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
while providing no assurance that idaho power will obtain a percent idaho roe in any of the years  idacorp and idaho power believe the ability to amortize additional aditc provides an element of earnings stability for and because its idaho roe exceeded 
table of contents percent  idaho power did not amortize additional aditc in under the settlement stipulation 
based on the terms of the december settlement stipulation  idaho power recorded during a million provision against current revenues  as a benefit to idaho customers in the form of a future rate reduction  and an additional million of pension expense  which will benefit idaho customers by reducing the amount of deferred pension expense that will be collected from customers in the future 
idaho power recorded million for the impact of similar sharing mechanisms in economic conditions and customer load growth when seeking to predict utility load changes for both short term load forecasts and long term infrastructure planning purposes  idaho power monitors a number of economic indicators  including employment rates  growth in customer numbers  and foreclosure rates and other housing related data on both a national scale and within idaho power service territory 
economic conditions can impact consumer demand for electricity  collectability of accounts  the volume of off system sales  and the need to purchase power to meet demand 
since  economic conditions in idaho power service territory have been relatively weak 
however  a number of improvements in economic conditions have occurred over the last few months 
after peaking at percent in early  the service area unemployment rate fell to percent by the end of and reached percent by the end of  according to idaho department of labor data 
the housing market in idaho power service territory has improved when measured by foreclosure rates and the available supply and pricing of housing 
idaho power also continues to experience customer growth  and a number of businesses have constructed facilities in idaho power service territory 
for the year ended december   the customer growth rate in idaho power service territory was approximately percent roughly twice the growth rate of the prior two years 
however  by comparison  for the year period ending in the average annual customer growth rate in idaho power service territory was percent 
idaho power predicts that customer growth within its service territory in the next few years will be positive  though at a rate below the year historical annual average 
in light of the uncertainty of the timing and pace of economic recovery in its service territory  and general underlying concerns remaining about the strength and pace of recovery of the economy and financial markets  idaho power continues to manage costs while executing its three part strategy of responsible planning  responsible development and protection of resources  and responsible energy use 
as the customer growth rate and demand have potentially stabilized  idaho power is transitioning from an emphasis on large capital projects  particularly generation  to an emphasis on maintaining and replacing aging assets while planning and building for the future 
idaho power plans to control operating and maintenance and capital costs through process and project reviews and through process improvement initiatives  and by empowering employees to identify means to reduce costs  build efficiencies  and enhance individual and enterprise performance 
these actions are particularly important at a time when customer growth is relatively low and new rates have been approved and implemented 
in december  idaho power filed an application with the ipuc requesting the temporary suspension during of two demand response programs that idaho power had previously implemented to reduce peak hour loads 
included was a discussion of the results of preliminary studies conducted in connection with idaho power irp  including a load and resource balance for the to period 
after application of a number of assumptions  under a scenario that excludes demand response programs and power capacity from the proposed boardman to hemingway kv transmission line  the peak hour load and resource balance indicates no peak hour load deficit until  which under those assumptions the need for near term peak hour resources like demand response programs or new near term supply side resources does not exist 
while these results preliminarily suggest that new generation projects are not necessary in the near term  idaho power has not completed its analysis and will not have completed its analysis until the publication of its irp in mid the irp will describe the estimated timing of potential generation and transmission projects 
weather conditions and associated impacts weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on energy sales and the seasonality of those sales 
relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy usage for heating and cooling  respectively 
during the agricultural growing season  which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters  irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
for instance  the percent increase in energy use by general business customers during compared to was largely attributable to agricultural growing conditions from april through june that required above average use of irrigation equipment 
as noted above  idaho power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates  which contribute to increased revenues during higher load periods  most notably the third quarter of each year when customer demand is typically at its peak 
on july   idaho power achieved a record load demand of  mw 
the previous record load demand was  mw  set on june  idaho power hydroelectric facilities comprise nearly one half of idaho power nameplate generation capacity 
the availability and volume of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  base flows in the snake river  spring flows  rainfall  water leases and other water rights  and other weather and stream flow considerations 
idaho power expects 
table of contents hydroelectric generation during to be in the range of to million megawatt hours mwh  based on reservoir storage levels and forecasted weather conditions as of the date of this report  compared to actual generation of million mwh in  million mwh in  and million mwh in median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced idaho power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power  however  most of the increase in power supply costs is deferred as a regulatory asset and collected from customers through its idaho and oregon power cost adjustment pca mechanisms described later in this md a 
conversely  in periods of greater hydroelectric generation most of the resulting decrease in power supply costs that typically occurs is returned to customers through the pca mechanisms 
where favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for idaho power  they also may be abundant for other pacific northwest hydroelectric facility operators  thus increasing the available supply of lower cost power and depressing regional wholesale market prices  which impacts the revenue idaho power receives from off system sales of its excess power 
conversely  when hydroelectric generating conditions are poor  wholesale market prices may be higher due to lower supply  but idaho power would have less surplus energy available for sale into the wholesale markets 
again  much of the adverse or favorable impact of these costs is addressed through the pca mechanisms 
fuel and purchased power expense in addition to hydroelectric generation and power it purchases in the wholesale markets  idaho power relies significantly on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities 
fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes  the terms of contracts for fuel  idaho power power generation capacity  the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind energy  the availability of hydroelectric generation resources  transmission capacity  energy market prices  and idaho power hedging program for managing fuel costs 
operation of idaho power newly constructed langley gulch power plant has increased idaho power use of natural gas as a generation fuel  and thus its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
purchased power costs are impacted by the terms of contracts for purchased power  the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind energy  and wholesale energy market prices 
idaho power is obligated to purchase power from some purpa generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then current load demand or wholesale energy market prices 
this increases the likelihood that idaho power will be required to reduce output from its lower cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel fired generation resources and may be required to sell in the wholesale power market the power it purchases from purpa projects at a significant loss 
integration of intermittent  non dispatchable resources such as wind energy into idaho power portfolio also creates a number of complex operational risks and challenges that idaho power is working to address  including through evaluation of the results of a recent comprehensive wind integration study 
notably  integration of these sources of power into idaho power portfolio does not eliminate idaho power need to construct facilities and infrastructure that provide reliable power 
for instance  at the time idaho power reached its all time system peak demand of  mw on july   wind resources on idaho power system  representing roughly mw of capacity  were contributing only mw of power due to lack of wind 
increases in federally mandated purpa power purchases were a significant driver of increased power purchase costs during and will likely continue to push power purchase costs  and correspondingly  customer rates  higher 
the idaho and oregon pca mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts to idaho power of fluctuations in idaho power power supply costs  including percent of the idaho jurisdiction purpa power purchase costs 
idaho power also uses physical and financial forward contracts for both electricity and fuel in order to manage the risks relating to fuel and power price exposures 
regulatory and environmental compliance costs and expenditures idaho power is subject to extensive federal and state laws  policies  and regulations  as well as regulatory actions and audits  including ferc and north american electric reliability corporation nerc reliability requirements 
compliance with these requirements directly influences idaho power operating environment and may significantly increase idaho power operating costs 
further  potential monetary and non monetary penalties for a violation of applicable laws or regulations may be substantial 
accordingly  idaho power has in place numerous compliance policies and initiatives  and frequently evaluates  updates  and supplements those policies and initiatives 
in particular  environmental laws and regulations may  among other things  increase the cost of operating power generation plants and constructing new facilities  require that idaho power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants  or require that idaho power cease operating certain power generation plants 
for instance  the boardman coal fired power plant  in which idaho power owns a percent interest  is scheduled to cease coal fired operations by the end of  the decision for which was driven in large part by the substantial cost of environmental controls 
idaho power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade 
as legislation and regulations concerning 
table of contents greenhouse gas emissions develop  idaho power assesses  when and to the extent determinable  the potential impact on the costs to operate its power generation facilities  as well as the willingness or ability of joint owners of power plants to fund any required pollution control equipment upgrades in lieu of early plant retirements 
for instance  idaho power recently concluded cost studies and scenario analyses to assess the potential future investments necessary for the continued operation of the jim bridger and valmy coal fired generation facilities 
idaho power published the results of the study with its irp update filed with the opuc in february  concluding that planned investments in environmental controls at the plants are appropriate 
other notable matters and areas of focus pension plan funding from to idaho power contributed million to its defined benefit pension plan 
in may the ipuc authorized idaho power to increase its annual recovery and amortization of deferred pension costs from million to million 
while idaho power does not anticipate that any cash contributions will be required in  it does expect to make additional significant cash contributions to the pension plan in the future 
idaho power defers pension costs related to its idaho jurisdiction until those costs are recovered through rates 
while the ipuc authorization to increase the annual recovery has mitigated in large part the adverse impacts of the contributions  the magnitude of the contributions relative to the annual cost recovery creates a lag between the timing of expenditures and their recovery  which impacts idacorp and idaho power cash flows 
while idaho power does not  as of the date of this report  have an expected date to request from regulators an additional increase in cost recovery  it may determine to do so if future contributions continue to be similar in magnitude to those made in recent years 
water management and relicensing of the hells canyon hydroelectric project because of idaho power reliance on stream flow in the snake river and its tributaries  idaho power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights  seeking to preserve the long term availability of its rights for use at its hydroelectric projects 
also  idaho power is involved in renewing federal licenses for the hcc  its largest hydroelectric generation source  and recently received a year license renewal from the ferc for its swan falls hydroelectric project 
relicensing involves numerous environmental issues and substantial costs 
idaho power is working with the states of idaho and oregon  regulatory authorities  and interested parties to address concerns and take appropriate measures relating to the relicensing of the hcc 
however  given the number of parties and issues involved  idaho power relicensing costs have been and will continue to be substantial 
transmission projects idaho power continues to focus on expansion of its transmission system in an effort to improve system reliability and access to wholesale markets 
its most notable projects in progress include the proposed boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission projects 
in january  idaho power entered into cost sharing arrangements with third parties for the permitting phases of both projects 
construction of these projects cannot commence until all federal  state  and local regulatory requirements are met 
based on idaho power assessment of the status and future milestones for the boardman to hemingway project  idaho power has determined that an in service date prior to is unlikely

this increase was substantially offset by the net impact of a tax method change and favorable irs examination settlements recorded in general rate increases implemented in the first quarter of  a july rate increase related to idaho power new langley gulch power plant  and other rate changes combined to increase operating income by million when compared to higher sales volumes  driven primarily by a warmer  drier spring in that caused significant increases in irrigation usage when compared with the prior year  increased operating income by million 
as a result of an irs examination settlement reached in  idaho power recognized approximately million of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to a uniform capitalization method agreement with the irs for tax years and prior 

table of contents as a result of the impact on earnings of the rate and sales volume increases described above  idaho power recorded a total of million related to a december settlement agreement with the ipuc  which required sharing with customers of a portion of idaho jurisdiction earnings exceeding a specified return on year end equity 
of the total  million was recorded as additional pension expense  which will benefit idaho customers by reducing the amount of deferred pension expense that will need to be collected from customers in the future  and million was recorded as a provision against current revenues to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction 
in  idaho power recorded million of additional pension expense and a million provision against revenues to be refunded to customers under similar agreements 
the table below summarizes the effect of the sharing mechanisms on operating income between and effect of sharing on operating income variance provision against current revenue as a result of sharing additional pension expense funded through sharing total key operating and financial metrics for idacorp s and idaho power s outlook for full year metrics as of the date of this report are as follows estimate actual idaho power operating maintenance expense millions idaho power additional amortization of aditc millions less than none idaho power capital expenditures  excluding afudc millions idaho power hydroelectric generation million mwh the estimated hydroelectric generation range is based on reservoir storage levels and forecasted weather conditions as of the date of this report 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and idaho power s earnings during the year ended december  in this analysis  the results for are compared to and the results for are compared to megawatt hours mwh and dollar amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
utility operations the table below presents idaho power s energy sales  in mwh  and supply for the last three years 
year ended december  general business sales off system sales total energy sales hydroelectric generation coal generation natural gas and other generation total system generation purchased power line losses total energy supply 
table of contents sales volume and generation in  general business sales volume increased by million mwh  mostly related to increased irrigation customer usage compared to the prior year 
off system sales volume decreased by million mwh in as decreases in output from hydroelectric resources and a small increase in customer load decreased surplus power available for sale 
hydroelectric generation comprised percent of idaho power s total system generation during hydroelectric generation in was percent of the annual median generation of million mwh  which is based on hydrologic conditions for the period through and adjusted to reflect the current level of water resource development 
the million mwh decrease in hydroelectric generation in compared to was primarily due to lower than normal hydroelectric generating conditions 
the million mwh increase in hydroelectric generation in compared to was due largely to favorable hydroelectric generating conditions 
the decrease in hydroelectric generation during led to an increased utilization of coal fired and natural gas fired generation 
the commencement of operations of the langley gulch natural gas fired power plant in the summer of allowed for less reliance on purchased power to replace the decreased hydroelectric generation 
idaho power s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
during   and  to reduce the magnitude of peak demands  idaho power utilized a number of demand response and energy efficiency programs 
on july   idaho power achieved a record load demand of  mw 
the highest winter peak demand of  mw was set on december  during these and other similar heavy load periods  idaho power s system is fully committed to serve loads and meet required operating reserves 
when loads exceed idaho power generation capacity  idaho power must rely on power obtained through purchase contracts from which power may not be available when needed if the source is intermittent power such as wind and may be required to purchase power in the wholesale energy spot market 
general business revenues the table below presents idaho power s general business revenues  mwh sales  and number of customers for the past three years 
year ended december  revenue residential commercial industrial irrigation total provision for sharing deferred revenues total general business revenues mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total customers at year end residential commercial industrial irrigation total as part of its january  general rate case order  the ipuc allowed idaho power to recover afudc for the hcc relicensing asset even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the relicensing asset has not been placed in service 
idaho power expects to collect approximately million annually in the idaho jurisdiction  but will defer revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the asset is placed in service 

table of contents changes in rates and changes in customer demand are the primary causes of fluctuations in general business revenue 
the table below presents the most significant rate increases and decreases  shown on an annualized basis  that impacted revenues over the last three years 
estimated annualized impact millions effective date description idaho settlement agreement idaho pca idaho pension expense recovery idaho pca idaho pension expense recovery idaho general rate case settlement agreement idaho pca idaho non ami meter depreciation idaho langley gulch oregon langley gulch the primary influences on customer demand are weather and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps  with increased precipitation reducing electricity usage 
rates are also seasonally adjusted and based on a tiered rate structure that provides for higher rates during peak load periods 
these seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings 
boise  idaho weather related information for the last three years is included in the table that follows 
year ended december  normal heating degree days cooling degree days heating and cooling degree days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning 
a degree day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees 
each degree of temperature above degrees is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below degrees is counted as one heating degree day 
general business revenues compared to general business revenue increased million in compared to the factors affecting general business revenues are discussed below 
rates 
rate changes  including those shown in the table above  combined to increase general business revenue by million in compared to the revenue impact of several of these rate changes was directly offset by associated changes in operating expenses 
for example  idaho jurisdiction pension expense recovery rate changes were fully offset by increased pension expense 
sharing 
a part of the increase in revenue resulted from revenue sharing mechanisms associated with two idaho regulatory agreements that provide for the sharing of idaho jurisdiction earnings exceeding a specified idaho roe 
the amount to be shared through future rate reduction is recorded as a current reduction to general business revenue 
reductions of million and million were recorded in and  respectively  resulting in a net increase to general business revenue of million in the smaller amount recorded in when compared with the prior year is partially due to changes in the terms of the mechanism in place each year  described in regulatory matters in this md a and in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
usage 
for  higher summer usage per customer increased general business revenue million compared to irrigation usage per customer was percent higher for when compared with due to agricultural growing conditions  including warm temperatures that allowed for the earlier planting of crops  and lower relative springtime precipitation  which resulted in greater electricity use to operate irrigation pumps 

table of contents customers 
termination of service to hoku materials  inc hoku during under an electric service agreement  offset by only moderate customer growth  decreased general business revenues by million 
customer growth from to was percent 
in march  the ipuc approved an electric service agreement between idaho power and hoku  to provide electric service to hoku s polysilicon production facility then under construction in idaho 
the initial term of the agreement was four years beginning december   with a maximum demand obligation during the initial term of mw 
in connection with an overdue invoice for electric service  in february idaho power  hoku  and the ipuc staff filed with the ipuc a settlement stipulation to amend the electric service agreement  and on march   the ipuc approved the stipulation revising the contract 
as a result of hoku failure to remain timely in payments under the revised agreement  idaho power terminated its provision of electric service under the revised agreement in may idaho power applied a million deposit to hoku april  may  and june invoices under the revised agreement and fully exhausted the deposit required by the revised agreement 
for full year and prior to termination of service  idaho power had anticipated contract payments of million that are unaffected by the pca mechanism and million of revenues that are affected by and flow through the pca mechanism  for a total of million 
as a result of termination of service and non payment  idaho power recognized million of full year revenues that are unaffected by the pca mechanism and no revenues that are affected by and flow through the pca mechanism 
the impact of non payment and associated decreases in revenue on net income was tempered in part by a decrease in costs idaho power would have incurred in connection with the provision of service to hoku and the impact of the pca mechanism 
general business revenues compared to general business revenue decreased million in compared to the factors affecting general business revenues are discussed below 
rates 
rate changes noted in the table above combined to reduce general business revenue by million in as compared to the million decline in revenue from commercial customers in relative to  notwithstanding an increase in usage  was largely due to the disproportionate impact of the pca rate reductions that went into effect in and commercial customer rates are typically subject to a greater adjustment when pca rates increase or decrease 
sharing 
much of the decrease in revenue resulted from revenue sharing mechanisms associated with idaho regulatory agreements that provide for the sharing of idaho jurisdiction earnings exceeding a specified idaho roe 
the amount shared through rate reduction was recorded as a reduction to general business revenue 
a reduction of million was recorded in no such amount was recorded in usage 
higher usage per customer in increased general business revenue million compared to the increase was due primarily to colder first quarter temperatures  which increased power demand for residential heating purposes  as well as a percent increase in cooling degree days during the year  which increased power demand for air conditioning purposes 
this increase was partially offset by a percent decrease in irrigation usage resulting from the cooler spring weather and the timing and level of precipitation during the second quarter of customers 
changes related to the hoku contract discussed above  along with a small increase in customer count  increased general business revenues by million 
customer growth from to was percent 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
the table below presents idaho power s off system sales for the last three years 
year ended december  revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh off system sales compared to off system sales revenue decreased by million  or percent  in as compared to  as a result of lower volumes 
sales volumes decreased by percent due to lower output from hydroelectric plants as a result of less favorable snow pack and spring season run off and a small increase in load needs when compared with 
table of contents off system sales compared to off system sales revenue increased million  or percent  in as compared to sales volumes nearly doubled  as increases in output from hydroelectric and purpa resources increased surplus power available for sale 
this increase was partially offset by a percent decrease in average prices due in part to abundant hydroelectric generation in the region 
other revenues the table below presents the components of other revenues for the last three years 
year ended december  transmission services  facility rental and other energy efficiency total other revenues compared to other revenues decreased million in as compared to  mainly due to a decrease in energy efficiency revenues of million  primarily due to demand response incentive payments to customers  which had been treated as an energy efficiency expense and recovered through the energy efficiency rider in and prior  were recorded as purchased power expense and recovered through the pca mechanism during  as discussed in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  and an increase of million in transmission system revenues  resulting principally from increases in wheeling services attributable to increases in ferc transmission rates that took effect on october  and october  energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills 
energy efficiency program expenditures are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues  resulting in no net impact on earnings 
the cumulative variance between expenditures and amounts collected through the rider is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability pending future collection from or obligation to customers 
a liability balance indicates that idaho power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that idaho power has spent more than it has collected 
other revenues compared to other revenues increased million in as compared to  mainly due to an increase of million in transmission system revenues  resulting principally from increases in wheeling services attributable to increases in ferc transmission rates that took effect on october  and  and from other facility rental increases  and a decrease in energy efficiency revenues of million  due in part to an ipuc order that moved custom efficiency payments to a regulatory asset to be amortized over time and recovered through general rate cases rather than through the energy efficiency rider 
the remaining decrease relates to lower customer incentives paid versus the prior year 
purchased power the table below presents idaho power s purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years 
year ended december  expense purpa contracts other purchased power including wheeling total purchased power expense mwh purchased purpa contracts other purchased power total mwh purchased cost per mwh from purpa contracts cost per mwh from other sources weighted average all sources 
table of contents the purchased power cost per mwh often exceeds the off system sales revenue per mwh because idaho power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods  which is higher priced energy  than during light load periods  which is lower priced energy  and conversely has less energy available for off system sales during heavy load periods than light load periods 
also  in accordance with idaho power s risk management policy  idaho power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery 
the regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy purchase or sale transactions that idaho power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance purchase or sale transaction prices 
purchased power compared to purchased power expense increased million  or percent  in as compared to  principally due to additional purpa wind generation that came on line and less favorable hydroelectric generating conditions 
mwh purchased through purpa contracts increased percent  contributing to a million increase in purpa power purchase expense in compared to  while mwh purchased through other sources increased percent 
overall mwh purchases increased due to less favorable hydroelectric generating conditions decreasing idaho power volume of self generated power 
the increase in mwh purchased was partially offset by a reduction in expense per mwh purchased 
average wholesale electricity prices were lower in relative to as a result of lower natural gas prices in the region  which reduced generation costs and  correspondingly  power prices 
in addition  million of demand response program charges were recorded as purchased power expense in these costs had been treated as an energy efficiency expense and recovered through the energy efficiency rider in and prior 
purchased power compared to purchased power expense increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was driven by mwh purchased from purpa contracts  which increased percent due to new purpa wind generation facilities coming on line 
the increase was partially offset by reduced wholesale market purchases resulted from idaho power above average hydroelectric generation in  and continued reliance on financial hedges to mitigate potential changes in forecasted hydroelectric conditions 
wholesale market purchases were also down due to lower system loads resulting from relatively mild weather 
fuel expense idaho power s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants for the last three years are included in the table below 
year ended december  expense coal natural gas and other total fuel expense mwh generated coal natural gas and other total mwh generated cost per mwh coal natural gas and other weighted average  all sources most fuel supply contracts are subject to changes in published indexes that are closely related to materials and supplies  labor  and diesel costs 
in addition to commodity variable costs  both natural gas and coal expense include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges  transportation  and fuel handling 
period to period variances in fuel expense per mwh such as the cost per mwh for natural gas and other in compared to and are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the two periods 
fuel expense compared to in  fuel expense increased million  or percent  compared to  due to higher output at the coal fired power plants and at the langley gulch plant  which came on line during the summer of the output at the coal fired plants was up million mwh  or percent  in compared to the increased dispatch was primarily caused by lower hydroelectric generation in than in 
table of contents fuel expense compared to in  fuel expense decreased million  or percent  compared to due to lower generation at idaho power thermal plants 
the output at these plants was down million mwh  or percent in compared to the reduced dispatch was primarily caused by lower regional power prices due to higher regional hydroelectric and wind generation 
the impact of lower thermal generation was partially offset by higher coal prices 
during parts of  the bridger and valmy generating plants received fuel from prior lower cost contracts 
pca mechanisms idaho power power supply costs can vary significantly from year to year  primarily because of the impacts of weather  system loads  and commodity markets 
to address the volatility of power supply costs  in addition to its hedging program idaho power has pca mechanisms for both the idaho and oregon jurisdictions 
these mechanisms allow idaho power to recover from or refund to customers most of the fluctuations in power supply costs 
because of these mechanisms  the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period  or cash that is collected is refunded to customers  resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year 
pca expense represents the effects of the idaho and oregon pca mechanisms 
the table below presents the components of the idaho and oregon pca mechanisms for the last three years 
year ended december  idaho power supply cost deferral accrual oregon power supply cost deferral accrual amortization to expense of prior year authorized balances total power cost adjustment expense the power supply accruals or deferrals represent the portion of that period power supply cost fluctuations accrued or deferred under the pca mechanisms 
accruals represent additional costs being recorded as a result of actual power supply costs that were less than the amount forecasted in pca rates 
the power supply cost is a deferral in because actual power supply costs in were higher than the amounts forecasted in pca rates 
if actual power supply costs are greater than the amount forecasted in pca rates  the majority of the excess is deferred 
the amortization of the prior year s balances represents the amounts being collected refunded in the current pca year that were deferred or accrued in the prior pca year the true up component of the pca 
pca mechanisms compared to actual net power supply costs increased in relative to  resulting in a change of million from accruals of million to deferrals of million 
the million of amortization reflects the net refunding to customers of prior years accruals 
pca mechanisms compared to actual net power supply costs decreased in relative to  resulting in a change of million from a deferral of million to an accrual of million 
for  net collections on previously deferred amounts have decreased due to lower pca true up rates  reducing the pca amortization by million 
other operations and maintenance expenses an explanation of the changes in operations and maintenance expenses for the periods presented is below 
o m compared to a million increase in other o m expense in as compared to was principally due to million in higher administrative expenses related to various increases in consultant costs  software licenses and maintenance  insurance reserves  and other purchased services 
a significant portion of the increase related to a lower reimbursement from the us department of energy doe for smart grid related items in compared to  increased payroll and other benefit expenses of million related to normal increases in employee wages and costs of providing employee benefits  and a million increase in transmission system maintenance expenses primarily related to line inspection costs  offset by a million decrease in thermal plant o m related to costs for maintenance outages that occurred in that did not recur in  as well as lower overall maintenance costs and consumable supplies due to lower utilization of these plants during the first half of the lower utilization was predominantly driven by low wholesale energy prices in the region during that period 

table of contents o m compared to the million increase in other o m expense in as compared to was principally due to million of increased pension expenses relating to the settlement stipulation that reduced a portion of idaho customers future obligation through a reduction in the pension regulatory asset  increased pension and other benefit expenses of million  primarily due to pension expense amortization that began in june and was increased in june in conjunction with recovery of deferred pension costs in rates  million in higher thermal o m due to maintenance outages at the valmy plant  partially offset by an equipment impairment taken in at the bridger plant that did not recur in  and an increase in other payroll related costs of million  offset by a combination of lower meter reading expense and the completed amortization of certain dsm expenses of million  and lower outside service fees of million 
income taxes income tax expense idacorp and idaho power income tax expense for increased significantly relative to  primarily as a result of greater pre tax earnings in and the tax benefits from irs examination settlements recorded in income tax expense in decreased significantly compared to  principally as a result of an irs examination settlement in related to idaho power uniform capitalization tax accounting method 
for additional information relating to idacorp and idaho power income taxes  see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
bonus depreciation the small business jobs act jobs act and the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of tax relief act include provisions for the extension and increase of bonus depreciation 
bonus depreciation provides for the accelerated deduction of current capital expenditures from certain asset classes 
the jobs act extended percent bonus depreciation to and the tax relief act extended bonus depreciation to and increased it to percent for a portion of and in addition  the american taxpayer relief act of extended percent bonus depreciation to idaho power has included an estimated bonus deprecation deduction in its current income tax provision 
the estimated deduction would reduce idaho power federal income tax liability by approximately million 
idaho power is evaluating the impacts the extension of bonus depreciation could have on its income taxes 
the state of idaho did not conform to the federal bonus depreciation rules for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards idacorp finished with a federal net operating loss carryforward of million  a federal general business tax credit carryforward of million  and a million idaho investment tax credit carryforward 
based on the expiration dates of the credits  as described in note income taxes tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  these amounts are expected to provide future cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources overview idacorp and idaho power operating cash flows are driven principally by idaho power sales of electricity and transmission capacity 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power  other operating expenses  capital expenditures  pension plan contributions  and interest 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions  rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings  and economic conditions 
as fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash  and at the same time their prices can be volatile and difficult to predict  idaho power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs 
however  if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates  deferral balances increase reflected as a regulatory asset  negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs  with interest  are recovered from customers 
idaho power uses operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and optimize capital expenditures  and funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations  debt offerings  commercial paper markets  credit facilities  and capital contributions from idacorp 
idaho power seeks to recover its operating costs and earn a return on its capital expenditures through rates  periodically filing for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to align idaho power earned returns with those allowed by regulators 
idaho power continues to make significant infrastructure investments 
during idaho power added capacity to its baseload generation through the completion of construction of the langley gulch power plant 
idaho power has also been pursuing 
table of contents significant transmission system enhancements and upgrading distribution facilities in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity  to provide service to new customers  and to maintain system reliability 
additionally  idaho power aging hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities require continuing upgrades and component replacement  and the costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities and complying with the new licenses are substantial 
idaho power estimates that total capital expenditures will be between million and million over the period from through a significant focus for will be to control costs and generate sufficient cash from operations to meet operating needs  contribute to capital expenditure requirements  and pay dividends to shareholders 
as of february   idacorp and idaho power access to debt  equity  and credit arrangements included their respective million and million revolving credit facilities  idacorp shelf registration statement  which it may use for the issuance of debt securities and common stock  including up to million shares of idacorp common stock available for issuance under its continuous equity program 
approximately million of debt and equity securities issuances remained available under the shelf registration statement  idaho power shelf registration statement  which it may use for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities  million remained available under the shelf registration statement  which expires in may  and idacorp and idaho power issuance of commercial paper  which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities  and is used to meet short term liquidity requirements 
idacorp and idaho power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions where possible in light of future needs 
to meet maturing long term debt obligations and costs of infrastructure development  such as idaho power kv transmission projects  the companies may use a combination of internally generated funds  credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt or equity and  in the case of idaho power  capital contributions from idacorp 
idacorp and idaho power expect to continue financing capital requirements during with a combination of internally generated funds and externally financed capital  and believe that access to their credit facilities and commercial paper  operating cash flows generated by idaho power utility business  and ability to issue medium term notes will be sufficient to meet short term obligations and debt maturities in idaho power has million of first mortgage bonds due in october  with no first mortgage bonds due thereafter until idacorp and idaho power expect a minimal need for any additional external financing in  other than for the repayment of the first mortgage bonds due in october and issuances of commercial paper to meet cash balancing needs from time to time 
effective july   idacorp discontinued original issuances of common stock and instructed the plan administrators to use market purchases of idacorp common stock for purposes of acquiring idacorp common stock for the idacorp  inc dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan and the idaho power company employee savings plan 
however  idacorp may determine at any time to resume original issuances of common stock under those plans 
idacorp may also determine to issue common stock from time to time under its continuous equity program  depending on market conditions and capital needs 
an important component of that determination will be idacorp and idaho power capital structure 
idacorp and idaho power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately percent debt and percent equity  and maintaining this ratio influences idacorp and idaho power debt and equity issuance decisions 
as of december   idacorp and idaho power capital structures were as follows idacorp idaho power debt equity operating cash flows idacorp s and idaho power s operating cash inflows for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
idacorp operating cash flows decreased by million and idaho power decreased by million compared to the year ended december  with the exception of cash flows related to income taxes  idacorp s operating cash flows are principally derived from the operating cash flows of idaho power

financing programs shelf registrations idacorp has an effective shelf registration statement that  as of the date of this report  can be used for the issuance of up to million of debt securities and common stock 
idaho power has an effective registration statement that  as of the date of this report  can be used for the issuance of up to million of first mortgage bonds and unsecured debt 
the issuance of first mortgage bonds requires that idaho power meet interest coverage and security provisions set forth in the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust securing the bonds 
future issuances of first mortgage bonds are subject to satisfaction of covenants and security provisions set forth in the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  market conditions  regulatory authorizations  and covenants contained in other financing agreements 
the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust limits the amount of additional first mortgage bonds that idaho power may issue to the sum of a the principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds and b percent of total unfunded property additions  as defined in the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust 
as of december   idaho power could issue approximately billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on retired first mortgage bonds and total unfunded property additions 
however  the indenture of mortgage and 
table of contents deed of trust further limits the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds at any one time outstanding to billion  and as a result the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds idaho power could issue as of december  was limited to approximately million 
idaho power may increase the billion limit on the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding by filing a supplemental indenture with the trustee as provided in the indenture of mortgage and deed of trust 
refer to note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding long term financing arrangements 
credit facilities idacorp and idaho power have million and million credit facilities  respectively 
each of the credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up 
idacorp facility permits borrowings under a revolving line of credit of up to million at any one time outstanding  including swingline loans not to exceed million at any time and letters of credit not to exceed million at any time 
idacorp facility may be increased  subject to specified conditions  to million 
idaho power facility permits borrowings through the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit of up to million at any one time outstanding  including swingline loans not to exceed million at any one time 
idaho power facility may be increased  subject to specified conditions  to million 
the interest rates for any borrowings under the facilities are based on either a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate  federal funds rate plus percent  or libor rate plus percent  or the libor rate  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on idacorp or idaho power  as applicable  senior unsecured long term indebtedness credit rating by moody investors service  inc  standard and poor ratings services  and fitch rating services  inc  as set forth on a schedule to the credit agreements 
the companies also pay a facility fee based on the respective company credit rating for senior unsecured long term debt securities 
each facility contains a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization equal to or less than as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
in determining the leverage ratio  consolidated indebtedness broadly includes all indebtedness of the respective borrower and its subsidiaries  including  in some instances  indebtedness evidenced by certain hybrid securities as defined in the credit agreement 
consolidated total capitalization is calculated as the sum of all consolidated indebtedness  consolidated stockholders equity of the borrower and its subsidiaries  and the aggregate value of outstanding hybrid securities 
at december   the leverage ratios for idacorp and idaho power were percent and percent  respectively 
idacorp and idaho power ability to utilize the credit facilities is conditioned upon their continued compliance with the leverage ratio covenants included in the credit facilities  which could limit the ability of the companies to issue first mortgage bonds and debt securities 
there are additional covenants  subject to exceptions  that prohibit certain mergers  acquisitions  and investments  restrict the creation of certain liens  and prohibit entering into any agreements restricting dividend payments from any material subsidiary 
at february   idacorp and idaho power were in compliance with all facility covenants 
further  idacorp and idaho power do not believe they will be in violation or breach of their respective debt covenants during  but were circumstances to arise that may alter that view management would take appropriate action to mitigate any such issue 
the events of default under both facilities include  without limitation  non payment of principal  interest  or fees  materially false representations or warranties  breach of covenants  bankruptcy or insolvency events  condemnation of property  cross default to certain other indebtedness  failure to pay certain judgments  change of control  failure of idacorp to own free and clear of liens the voting stock of idaho power  the occurrence of specified events or the incurring of specified liabilities relating to benefit plans  and the incurring of certain environmental liabilities  subject  in certain instances  to cure periods 
upon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of idacorp or idaho power or the appointment of a receiver  the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the applicable facility and to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable 
upon any other event of default  the lenders holding greater than percent of the outstanding loans or greater than percent of the aggregate commitments required lenders or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and to issue letters of credit under the facility and or declare the obligations to be due and payable 
during an event of default under the facilities  the lenders may  at their option  increase the applicable interest rates then in effect and the letter of credit fee by percentage points per annum 
a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing  but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities 
however  if idaho power ratings are downgraded below investment grade  idaho power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its ipuc and opuc regulatory orders 
while the credit facilities provide for an original maturity date of october   the credit agreements grant idacorp and idaho power the right to request up to two one year extensions  in each case subject to certain conditions 
on october   idacorp and idaho power executed first extension agreements with each of the lenders  extending the maturity date under 
table of contents both agreements to october  no other terms of the credit agreements  including the amount of permitted borrowings under the credit agreements  were affected by the extension 
without additional approval from the ipuc  the opuc  and the public service commission of wyoming  the aggregate amount of short term borrowings by idaho power at any one time outstanding may not exceed million 
commercial paper idacorp and idaho power have commercial paper programs under which they may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the available capacity under their respective credit facilities  described above 
idacorp and idaho power credit facilities are available to the companies to support borrowings under their commercial paper programs 
the commercial paper issuances are used to provide an additional financing source for the companies short term liquidity needs 
the maturities of the commercial paper issuances will vary  but may not exceed days from the date of issue 
individual instruments carry a fixed rate during their respective terms  although the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions  subjecting the companies to fluctuations in interest rates

such ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change 
each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and  accordingly  each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
idaho power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and or posted with certain counterparties 
as of december   idaho power had posted no performance assurance collateral 
should idaho power experience a reduction in its credit rating on its unsecured debt to below investment grade idaho power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral  and counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions 
based upon idaho power s current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of december   the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately million 
to minimize capital requirements  idaho power actively monitors its portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral  through sensitivity analysis

scr is required to be installed and operational on unit by and unit by an equivalent technology will be required for nox reductions on unit by and unit by idaho power estimates that the total cost for idaho power share of the upgrades on units and is approximately million  excluding afudc 
while idaho power does not have estimates for the cost to install scr on units and  particularly given the technological changes that may occur prior to the installation date on those units  it is possible that the costs will be equal to  or greater than  the costs for units and refer to part i  item i business environmental regulation and costs and part ii  item md a environmental matters for additional discussion on environmental controls and anticipated costs  which will be significant in the foreseeable future 
boardman to hemingway transmission line the boardman to hemingway line  a proposed mile  kv transmission project between a station near boardman  oregon and the hemingway station near boise  idaho  would provide transmission service to meet needs identified in the irp 
idaho power estimated share of the cost of the permitting phase of the project is million  including afudc 
total cost estimates for the project are between approximately million and million  including afudc 
this cost estimate excludes the impacts of inflation and price changes of materials and labor resources that may occur following the date of the estimate 
idaho power share of the permitting phase of the project excluding afudc is included in the capital requirements table above 
construction costs beyond the permitting phase are not included in the table above 
in january  idaho power  pacificorp  and the bonneville power administration bpa entered into a joint permit funding agreement bh funding agreement  which provides that the parties will seek to jointly fund and support the process of completing environmental studies  including an environmental impact statement eis pursuant to the national environmental policy act  and obtaining governmental authorizations and permits for rights of way over public lands  necessary to develop the project 
the planning  design  procurement  and acquisition of private rights of way  private easements  and similar private property interests are not within the scope of the bh funding agreement 
idaho power is designated as the project manager  responsible for administering and overseeing the project and for the day to day activities involved in advancing the project 
the bh funding agreement assigns each party a permitting interest based on each party specified capacity ownership interests 
the agreement provides for permitting interests of percent for idaho power  percent for bpa  and for pacificorp in the project 
the agreement further provides that during future negotiations pertaining to development and construction agreements  the parties will seek to retain interests in the project equal to their respective permitting interests 
pacificorp or bpa may withdraw from the bh funding agreement at any time 
in october  the bpa issued a statement that it had completed an initial prioritization of potential service arrangements for its customer load in southeastern idaho and  while it had not made a final decision on options for this service  the bpa identified the boardman to hemingway line with a transmission asset swap as a top priority for pursuit during and beyond 
according to the bpa  of the options it evaluated  the boardman to hemingway line with a transmission asset swap has the potential to keep the bpa costs low relative to the other options considered 
federal and state permitting continues to move forward with a draft eis expected to be issued in mid the completion date of the project is subject to siting  permitting  regulatory approvals  in service date requirements of the parties electing to construct the line  the terms of any resulting joint construction agreements  and other conditions 
based on idaho power assessment of those and other factors  idaho power continues to believe that a project in service date prior to is unlikely 
memorandum of understanding  dated january   among idaho power  pacificorp  and bpa mou executed in connection with the bpa participation in the joint funding agreement for the boardman to hemingway line  the mou provides that the parties will negotiate in good faith the terms of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements that would allow bpa to meet its load service obligations in southeast idaho 
it provides that the parties will explore opportunities to establish eastern idaho load service from the hemingway substation in exchange for similar service from the federal columbia river transmission system 
the mou outlines at least two potential alternatives for further negotiation  including a network service option and an asset ownership rights option on the parties transmission systems  both of which include bpa participation in the boardman to hemingway transmission line 
any party may terminate the mou at any time  without penalty  and the mou automatically expires on december  gateway west transmission line idaho power and pacificorp are pursuing the joint development of the gateway west project  a kv transmission project between a station located near douglas  wyoming and the hemingway station 
idaho power estimated cost for the permitting phase of the gateway west project is approximately million  including afudc 
as of the date of this report  idaho power estimates the total cost for its share of the project including both permitting and 
table of contents construction to be between million and million  including afudc 
idaho power share of the permitting phase of the project excluding afudc is included in the capital requirements table above 
construction costs are not included in the table above 
timing of the construction of each segment of the project is subject to siting  permitting  regulatory approvals  in service date requirements of the parties electing to construct the line  the terms of any resulting joint construction agreements  and other conditions 
in january  idaho power and pacificorp entered into a project development agreement gateway funding agreement outlining the terms under which the parties will jointly own  develop  design  permit  site  and acquire rights of way for the gateway west transmission project 
idaho power interest in the gateway west project applies to four of ten segments involved in the project  referred to as segments which idaho power had previously constructed and is included only for purposes of federal permitting related to the gateway west project    and  comprised of    and miles  respectively and each of which is kv 
pacificorp is designated as the project manager under the agreement 
the gateway funding agreement provides that the project manager may seek to reconfigure portions of the federal permitting project  including segments in which idaho power has an interest  subject to certain limitations 
further  pacificorp retains the right to remove specified segments from the federal permitting project  including segments in which idaho power has an interest  subject to certain limitations specified in the gateway funding agreement 
each party is responsible for its pro rata share  based on its respective federal and state permitting ownership interest  of the costs incurred under the agreement 
idaho power state permitting interest in its segments is percent for segment and percent for each of segments   and  with a federal permitting interest in the project of percent 
the gateway funding agreement provides for the parties to subsequently meet to negotiate the terms and conditions of one or more definitive development and construction agreements for the gateway west transmission line 
the agreement specifies that the parties intend that the terms of any construction agreement would provide that idaho power is entitled to one third of the anticipated bi directional transmission capacity on segments   and  and one third of any total incremental system capacity on those segments  and that pacificorp is entitled to the remaining two thirds interest 
a party may withdraw from the federal permitting project  all or a portion of the state permitting project relating to one or two of segments   and  or the agreement in its entirety 
upon withdrawal  the withdrawing party forfeits its rights  title  and interest in the agreement and associated tangible and intangible property rights or  if withdrawing from less than all segments  its rights  title  and interest in those segments from which it withdraws 
in october  the us bureau of land management blm released its preferred routes for the project  and idaho power is engaged in discussions with stakeholders as the routes are evaluated 
while the blm schedule provides for the issuance of a final eis in the first quarter of and a record of decision in mid  idaho power expects that those milestones could be delayed until later in shoshone falls plant expansion the shoshone falls plant expansion project was included in idaho power irp and consists of constructing a new powerhouse  intake structure  penstock  and substation and the installation of a new turbine to increase the nameplate generation capacity of the plant from mw to mw 
idaho power estimates the total cost of the generation capacity expansion project to be million  excluding afudc  with an in service date during  subject to the outcomes of further engineering and cost studies and regulatory authorization 
the estimated in service date is a two year delay from the prior estimated in service date 
irp update and potential changes to capital project mix as a public utility under the jurisdiction of the ferc  the ipuc  and the opuc  idaho power is obligated to plan for and expand its transmission system to provide requested firm transmission service to third parties  to construct and place in service sufficient generation and transmission capacity to reliably deliver resources to network customers and the company s retail customers  and otherwise take actions to fulfill its obligation to provide safe and reliable electric service 
as part of its resource planning  and in accordance with regulatory requirements  idaho power prepares and publishes an irp every two years 
the irp addresses available supply side and demand side resource options  planning period load forecasts  potential resource portfolios  a risk analysis  and near term and long term action plans 
idaho power future resource build out plans are heavily influenced by the results of the irp process 
refer to item business utility operations resource planning in this report for additional information on idaho power irp 
based on preliminary work conducted on the irp  idaho power expects a significant change in its assumptions relative to the irp 
in the irp  idaho power identified resource needs in the relative near term 
however  based on one scenario that would exclude demand response programs and power capacity from the proposed boardman to hemingway kv transmission line  the preliminary peak hour load and resource balance prepared for the irp indicates no peak hour load deficit until under those assumptions  the need for near term peak hour resources does not exist 
idaho power 
table of contents anticipates that the expected near term resource sufficiency will impact the timing of development of supply side resources  including those described above  and the need for demand response programs in the near term 
at times  idaho power may seek to accelerate  scale back  modify  or eliminate projects  or seek alternative projects  to accommodate anticipated resource needs and to help ensure its ability to provide reliable electric service and meet load and transmission capacity obligations 
scaling back or eliminating a project due to regulatory challenges or other factors influencing the feasibility of a project may result in idaho power pursuing one or more separate  more costly projects 
for instance  if idaho power were unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads  it may terminate those projects and  as an alternative  develop additional generation facilities within areas where idaho power has available transmission capacity 
idaho power irp seeks to address these potential alternatives and their associated risks and costs 
termination of a project carries with it the potential for a write off of all or a significant portion of the costs associated with the project 
environmental regulation costs idaho power anticipates that it will incur significant expenditures for the installation of environmental controls at its coal plants and for its hydroelectric relicensing efforts 
these cost estimates are summarized in item business of this report 
the capital portion of these amounts is included in the capital requirements table above but do not include costs related to possible changes in current or new environmental laws or regulations and enforcement policies that may be enacted in response to issues such as climate change and emissions from coal fired and gas fired generation plants 
other capital requirements idacorp non regulated capital expenditures are primarily related to ifs tax structured investments 
as of the date of this report  idacorp does not anticipate any significant non regulated expenditures for the period from through defined benefit pension plan contributions idaho power contributed million  million  and million to its defined benefit pension plan in   and  respectively 
idaho power has evaluated the potential impact of recently approved federal legislation that will alter the timing and amount of future contributions to the defined benefit pension plan 
the legislation  signed into law in july  provides a smoothing mechanism applicable to the calculation of plan minimum contributions  and will reduce minimum amounts required to be contributed to the plan in at least the next few years 
the legislation partial funding relief is automatically effective for all contributions beginning in  and idaho power chose to adopt the funding relief for its contributions 
idaho power does not have a minimum contribution requirement for in and beyond  idaho power expects significant contribution obligations under the pension plan 
refer to note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the section titled contractual obligations below in this md a for information relating to those obligations 
in may  the ipuc authorized idaho power to increase its annual recovery and amortization of deferred pension costs from million to million 
the primary impact of pension contributions is on cash flows  as cost recovery lags the timing of contributions

dividends the amount and timing of dividends paid on idacorp s common stock are within the discretion of idacorp s board of directors 
idacorp board of directors reviews the dividend rate periodically to determine its appropriateness in light of idacorp s current and long term financial position and results of operations  capital requirements  rating agency requirements  contractual and regulatory restrictions  legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and idaho power in particular  competitive conditions  and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
the ability of idacorp to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries  primarily idaho power 
idacorp has a dividend policy that provides for a target long term dividend payout ratio of between and percent of sustainable idacorp earnings  with the flexibility to achieve that payout ratio over time and to adjust the payout ratio or to deviate from the target payout ratio from time to time based on the various factors that drive the idacorp board of directors dividend decisions 
notwithstanding the dividend policy adopted by the idacorp board of directors  the dividends idacorp pays remain in the discretion of the board of directors who  when evaluating the dividend amount  will continue to take into account the foregoing factors  among others 
on january   idacorp board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend  commencing with the dividend paid on february   to per share of idacorp common stock  from the prior quarterly dividend amount of per share of idacorp common stock 
on september   idacorp board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend again in  commencing with the dividend payable on november   to per share of idacorp

contingencies and proceedings idacorp and idaho power are involved in a number of litigation  alternative dispute resolution  and administrative proceedings  and are subject to claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  that could affect their future results of operations and financial condition 
certain legal or administrative proceedings to which idacorp or idaho power are parties or are otherwise involved  and certain actual or potential legal claims pertaining to idaho power  are described in note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
except where noted in note  in many instances idacorp and idaho power are unable to predict the outcomes of the matters or estimate the impact the proceedings may have on their financial positions  results of operations  or cash flows 
idaho power is also actively monitoring various environmental regulations that may have a significant impact on its future operations 
given uncertainties regarding the outcome  timing  and compliance plans for these environmental matters  idaho power is unable to determine the financial impact of potential new regulations  but does believe that future capital investment for infrastructure and modifications to its electric generating facilities to comply with these regulations could be significant 
off balance sheet arrangements idaho power has agreed to guarantee a portion of the performance of reclamation activities and obligations at bcc  of which ierco owns a one third interest 
this guarantee  which is renewed each december  was million at december   representing ierco one third share of bcc total reclamation obligation of million 
bcc has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs 
at december   the value of the reclamation trust fund totaled million 
during the reclamation trust fund distributed approximately million for reclamation activity costs associated with the bcc surface mine 
bcc periodically assesses the adequacy of the reclamation trust fund and its estimate of future reclamation costs 
to ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves  bcc has the ability to add a per ton surcharge to coal sales 
starting in  bcc began applying a nominal surcharge to coal sales in order to maintain adequate reserves in the reclamation trust fund 
because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per ton surcharge  the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal 
impact of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act establishes regulatory jurisdiction by the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the sec for certain swaps which include a variety of derivative instruments and the users of such swaps 
while idaho power believes that a number of obligations arising from rules issued under the dodd frank act will not directly apply to idaho power  the company believes that other participants in the commodities markets such as swap dealers and major swap participants will pass along their increased costs 
while implementation of the rules is in its infancy  and temporary operational disruptions and liquidity in the commodities markets could be adversely impacted  as of the date of this report idaho power expects that the long term financial and operational impact of the swap related provisions of the dodd frank act and the cftc and sec associated rules will not be significant 
regulatory matters introduction as a regulated utility  many of idaho power fundamental business decisions are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
idaho power is under the retail jurisdiction as to rates  service  accounting  and other general matters of utility operation of the ipuc and the opuc  which determine the rates that idaho power charges to its general business customers

also  as a public utility under the federal power act  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its oatt 
idaho power uses general rate cases  cost adjustment mechanisms  and subject specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and the costs of its energy efficiency and demand side resources programs  seeking to earn a return on 
table of contents investment where permitted by regulators 
idaho power remains focused on communicating with regulators the necessity of investments to better serve its customers  the prudence of the costs incurred  and the importance of a reasonable return on investment for idacorp shareholders 
idaho power need for rate relief and the development of rate case plans takes into consideration short term and long term needs  as well as specific factors that can affect the timing of rate filings 
such factors include  among other things  in service dates of major capital investments and the timing of changes in major revenue and expense items 
idaho power filed general rate cases in idaho and oregon during  as well as a single issue rate case for the langley gulch power plant in idaho and oregon in  which have largely concluded 
idaho power will continue to assess its need for general rate relief in consideration of the factors described above 
between general rate cases  idaho power relies upon power cost adjustment mechanisms  riders  and other mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag  which refers to the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and earning a return and recovering that investment or expense 
management focus on constructive regulatory outcomes in and has been targeted largely at general revenue rate cases and rate mechanisms

resetting of oregon base rates oregon general rate case settlement on february   the opuc approved a settlement stipulation in idaho power oregon general rate case providing for a million base rate increase  a return on equity of percent  and an overall rate of return of percent in the oregon jurisdiction 
new rates in conformity with the settlement stipulation went into effect on march  the opuc is conducting a second phase of the proceedings to address the prudence of idaho power pollution control investments at the jim bridger coal fired power plant 
idaho roe support through via december settlement in december  the ipuc issued an order  separate from the then pending idaho general rate case proceeding  approving a settlement stipulation that provided as follows if idaho power actual idaho roe for   or is less than percent  then idaho power may amortize additional aditc to help achieve a minimum percent idaho roe in the applicable year 
idaho power would be permitted to amortize additional aditc in an aggregate amount up to million over the three year period  but could use no more than million in  if idaho power actual idaho roe for   or exceeds percent  the amount of idaho power idaho jurisdictional earnings exceeding a percent and up to and including a percent idaho roe for the applicable year would be shared equally between idaho power and its idaho customers in the form of a rate reduction to become effective at the time of the subsequent year pca adjustment  and if idaho power actual idaho roe for   or exceeds percent  the amount of idaho power idaho jurisdictional earnings exceeding a percent idaho roe for the applicable year would be allocated percent to idaho power and percent to benefit idaho customer rates through an offset in the pension balancing account  which would reduce the amount idaho power would collect from customers in future rates 
the december settlement stipulation provided that the idaho roe thresholds percent  percent  and percent will be automatically adjusted prospectively in the event the ipuc approves a change to idaho power authorized return on equity as part of a general rate case proceeding seeking a rate change effective prior to january  as idaho power idaho roe exceeded percent  idaho power did not amortize additional aditc in in accordance with the sharing provisions of the settlement stipulation  idaho power recorded a million provision against current revenues  to be refunded to customers through a future rate reduction  and an additional million of pension expense  which will benefit idaho customers by reducing the amount of deferred pension expense that will be collected from customers in the future 
the december settlement and sharing mechanism followed a similar idaho settlement and sharing mechanism approved in january  described further in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which had a substantial impact on idacorp and idaho power results of operations as discussed in note 
increase in rate base completion and inclusion of the langley gulch power plant the langley gulch power plant became commercially available on june  on that date the ipuc issued an order approving a million  or percent  increase in annual idaho jurisdiction base rates  effective july   for recovery of idaho power investment in the power plant and associated costs 
on september   the opuc issued an order approving an approximately million increase in annual oregon jurisdiction base rates for recovery of the investment and associated costs  with new rates in effect october  change in deferred accrued net power supply costs deferred power supply costs represent certain differences between idaho power actual net power supply costs and the costs included in its retail rates  the latter being based on annual forecasts of power supply costs

ferc compliance programs the ferc has approved an extensive number of reliability standards developed by the nerc and the western electricity coordinating council wecc  including critical infrastructure protection cip standards and regional standard variations 
as part of its compliance program  idaho power periodically reviews its operations for compliance with ferc rules  orders  and standards and self reports compliance issues to the ferc and the wecc 
recent reports idaho power has submitted to the ferc have generally focused on standards of conduct and idaho power s ferc oatt 
consistent with prior years  during idaho power self reported to the ferc and received notices of alleged violations from the ferc and the wecc 
idaho power has also received notification that the ferc intends to take no further action regarding several issues previously reported by idaho power 
consistent with its historical practice  idaho power is working with the ferc and the wecc to resolve alleged violations and items it self reported to the ferc and the wecc 
idaho power is unable to predict what action  if any  the wecc or the ferc will take on those unresolved matters  but based on the nature of the potential violations idaho power does not expect any material adverse effect from currently alleged violations on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
idaho power plans to continue its efforts to reduce potential violations through its compliance program and its approach of self reporting compliance issues to  and working with  the ferc and the wecc 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects idaho power  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses have a term of to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
costs for the relicensing of idaho power hydroelectric projects are recorded in construction work in progress until new multi year licenses are issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
relicensing costs of million for the hcc  idaho power largest hydroelectric complex and a major relicensing effort  were included in construction work in progress at december  as of the date of this report  the ipuc authorizes idaho power to include in its idaho jurisdiction rates approximately million annually million grossed up for income taxes of afudc relating to the hcc relicensing project 
collecting these amounts now will reduce the amount collected in the future once the hcc relicensing costs are approved for recovery in base rates 
through december   idaho power has collected approximately million million grossed up for income taxes of afudc related to the hcc relicensing project through customer rates 
in addition to the discussion below  see environmental matters in this md a for a discussion of environmental compliance under ferc licenses for idaho power hydroelectric generating plants 
hells canyon complex the hcc  located on the snake river where it forms the border between idaho and oregon  provides approximately percent of idaho power hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and percent of its total generating nameplate capacity 
in july  idaho power filed an application with the ferc for a new license in anticipation of the july expiration of the then existing license 
since the expiration of that license  idaho power has been operating the project under annual licenses issued by the ferc 
in december  idaho power and eleven other parties  including nmfs and 
table of contents usfws  involved in the hcc relicensing process entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the hcc on esa listed species pending the relicensing of the project 
in august the ferc staff issued a final eis for the hcc  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the purpose of the final eis is to inform the ferc  federal and state agencies  native american tribes  and the public about the environmental effects of idaho power operation of the hcc 
certain portions of the final eis involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under section of the clean water act cwa and formal consultations under the endangered species act esa  which remain unresolved 
in connection with its relicensing efforts  idaho power has filed water quality certification applications  required under section of the cwa  with the states of idaho and oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards 
section of the cwa requires that a state either approve or deny a section water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the cwa 
as a consequence  idaho power has been filing and withdrawing its section certification applications with oregon and idaho on an annual basis while it has been working with the states to identify measures that will provide reasonable assurance that discharges from the hcc will adequately address applicable water quality standards 
in september  in connection with the issuance of its final eis  the ferc notified the nmfs and the usfws of its determination that the licensing of the hcc was likely to adversely affect esa listed species  including the bull trout and fall chinook salmon and steelhead  under the nmfs and usfws jurisdiction and requested that the nmfs and usfws initiate formal consultation under section of the esa on the licensing of the hcc 
each of the nmfs and usfws responded to the ferc that the conditions relating to the licensing of the hcc were not fully described or developed in the final eis as the measures to address the water quality effects of the project were yet to be fully defined by the section certification process pending before the oregon and idaho departments of environmental quality 
the nmfs and usfws therefore recommended that formal consultation under the esa be delayed until the section certification process is completed 
idaho power continues to work with idaho and oregon in the development of measures to provide reasonable assurance that any discharges from the hcc will comply with applicable state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project  and continues to cooperate with the usfws  nmfs  and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
measures that have been contemplated include potential watershed improvements or the installation of a temperature control structure to address water temperatures during a small portion of the year 
both the watershed approach and temperature control structure would add substantially to project costs 
for instance  in its august final eis the ferc proposed protection  mitigation  and enhancement measures had an estimated cost of approximately million per year  excluding costs associated with the section certification because they had not been defined at that time  and remain undefined 
as of the date of this report  idaho power is unable to predict the timing of issuance by the ferc of any license order or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs idaho power will incur in complying with the license 
swan falls project in september  the ferc issued to idaho power a year license for continued operation of the swan falls hydroelectric project sfp 
idaho power believes that operational changes associated with the new license for the sfp will be modest and that the capital investments it will be required to make under the terms of the license will be within the range idaho power expected at the time of submission of its application for the license 
shoshone falls plant expansion on july   the ferc amended the license for the shoshone falls project to expand its nameplate generating capacity from approximately mw to approximately mw 
the amended license has an expiration date of  but provides that the license will be extended to following completion of the proposed generation capacity expansion project 
on may   ferc granted idaho power a two year schedule extension  through july  to complete construction of the expansion 
however  idaho power does not expect that it would complete the generation capacity expansion project prior to  and thus plans to request an additional two year extension from the ferc 
idaho power determination to proceed with the expansion project remains subject to the outcome of additional cost studies and analysis and the results of further engineering and design work  and further analysis of idaho power supply side resource needs 
if idaho power ultimately determines to move forward with the full project  idaho power plans to obtain regulatory support from the ipuc and opuc prior to commencement of construction to mitigate in part the regulatory cost recovery risk associated with the project 
renewable energy contracts  renewable energy certificates  and emission allowances renewable portfolio standards numerous proponents have introduced legislation in the us congress that would require electric utilities to obtain a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable sources  commonly referred to as a renewable portfolio standard or rps 
however  as of the date of this report no federal or state of idaho rps is in effect 

table of contents idaho power will be required to comply with a percent rps in oregon beginning in  and idaho power expects to meet this requirement with recs from the elkhorn valley wind project 
idaho power continues to monitor proposed federal rps legislation and the possibility of additional state rps legislation 
pursuant to an ipuc order  idaho power is selling its near term recs and returning to customers their share shared with customers in the idaho jurisdiction of those proceeds through the pca 
for the years ended december  and  idaho power rec sales totaled million and million  respectively 
idaho power has sold all of its and earlier vintage recs 
idaho power has sold a portion of its recs and intends to continue selling its and later recs as they are generated and become available for sale 
were idaho power to be subject to additional rps legislation  it may cease in full or in part the sale of recs it receives  seek to obtain recs from additional projects  generate recs from any rec generating facilities it may own  or purchase recs in the market 
ordinarily  idaho power does not receive the recs associated with purpa projects 
however  an order issued by the ipuc on december   described below  provides that idaho power will own a portion of the recs generated by some future purpa projects 
the required purchase of recs to meet rps requirements would increase idaho power costs  which idaho power expects would be wholly or largely passed on to customers through rates and the power cost adjustment mechanism 
renewable energy contracts idaho power purchases wind power from both cogeneration and small power production cspp and non cspp facilities  including its largest non cspp wind power project the elkhorn valley wind project with a mw nameplate capacity 
as of december   idaho power had contracts to purchase energy from on line cspp wind power projects with a combined nameplate rating of mw 
in addition to its power purchase arrangements with wind power generators  idaho power has contracts for the purchase of power from other renewable generation sources  such as biomass  solar  and small hydroelectric projects 
as of december   idaho power had the number and nameplate capacity of signed cspp related agreements with terms ranging from one to years set forth in the table below 
status number of cspp contracts nameplate capacity mw on line as of december  contracted and projected to come on line by year end pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the ipuc and opuc have each issued orders and rules regulating idaho power purchase of power from cspp facilities 
a key component of the purpa power purchase contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements 
regulatory mandated execution of purpa agreements may result in idaho power acquiring energy it does not need at above wholesale market prices and require additional operational integration measures  thus increasing costs to idaho power customers 
substantially all purpa power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and idaho power power supply cost mechanisms  and thus the primary impact of purpa agreements is on customer rates 
purpa proceedings at the ipuc and opuc in response to a november  application filed by idaho power and two other electric utilities with idaho service territories  on february  the ipuc issued an order temporarily reducing the eligibility cap for purpa projects entitled to published avoided cost rates from amw to kw for wind and solar purpa projects while the ipuc further investigated the implications of large projects disaggregating into smaller projects to qualify for higher published avoided cost rates and other benefits 
on june   the ipuc issued an order maintaining the kw eligibility cap for published avoided cost rates for wind and solar purpa projects  and initiating additional proceedings to allow the parties to investigate and analyze the methodologies used in determining the appropriate power purchase price for purpa projects 
on that same date  the ipuc issued orders disapproving purpa wind power purchase agreements 
idaho power estimates that the payments over the lives of the disapproved agreements would have totaled approximately billion 
idaho power recently concluded proceedings at the ipuc relating to the determination of appropriate power purchase prices and other terms of purpa power purchase agreements 
on december   the ipuc issued an order addressing that and other aspects of purpa contracts 
the ipuc retained the existing kw threshold for wind and solar projects eligible for published avoided cost rates and determined that for projects not eligible for published avoided cost rates  the price used for power purchase determinations would be updated annually based on updated natural gas prices and idaho power updated load forecast 
the ipuc also determined that recs will be owned by the purpa project developer for projects eligible for published avoided cost rates  and apportioned equally between the project developer and idaho power for other projects 
the ipuc order also provided that new projects will be paid for capacity based on the project ability to deliver during peak hours and when idaho power long range plan shows the company is capacity deficient 
similar proceedings at the opuc are also ongoing 

table of contents environmental matters overview idaho power is subject to a broad range of federal  state  regional  and local laws and regulations designed to protect  restore  and enhance the environment 
current and pending environmental legislation relates to  among other items  climate change  greenhouse gas emissions and air quality  mercury and other emissions  hazardous wastes  polychlorinated biphenyls  and endangered and threatened species  and include  among others  the clean air act caa  the cwa  the resource conservation and recovery act  the toxic substances control act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  and the esa 
in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and associated costs  these laws and regulations provide authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance  injunctive relief  and other sanctions 
these laws and regulations are administered by federal agencies including the us environmental protection agency epa  the usfws  and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa formerly the national marine fisheries service  and state and local agencies 
idaho power three coal fired power plants and three natural gas fired combustion turbine power plants are also subject to many of these regulations 
idaho power hydroelectric projects are also subject to a number of water discharge standards and other environmental requirements 
because these plants utilize different fuel sources  there is the likelihood that each plant will be subject to different regulations and requirements 
see part i  item properties in this report for further information on these power plants 
compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the construction costs and lead time for new facilities  require the modification of existing generating plants  require the curtailment or shut down of existing generating plants  or reduce the output from current generating facilities 
current and future environmental laws and regulations will increase the cost of operating coal fired power plants and constructing new facilities  will necessitate installation of additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants  or result in idaho power discontinuing operation of one or more coal fired plants where operation becomes uneconomical 
these regulations could  in turn  affect idacorp and idaho power results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and plant shut downs cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis 
part i business environmental regulation and costs in this report includes a summary of idaho power expected capital and operating expenditures for environmental matters during the period from to given the uncertainty of future environmental regulations  idaho power is unable to predict its environmental related expenditures beyond that time  though they could be substantial 
idacorp and idaho power boards of directors review environmental issues on a regular basis  including in connection with the strategic planning process 
in connection with its irp process  idaho power has been conducting cost studies and scenario analysis to assess the potential future investments necessary for the continued operation of the jim bridger and valmy coal generation facilities  in light of the body of environmental laws and regulations impacting the cost of operating those plants 
the boardman coal facility was not included in the study because of the existing schedule to cease coal fired operations at that plant by the end of some of the future environmental control requirements for the jim bridger and valmy plants are known  however  many potential additional requirements could arise from future regulations 
in the analysis  the cost of future compliance was compared to the cost of replacement generation capacity provided by combined cycle combustion turbine technology 
because of the speculative nature of many of the future requirements  the analysis was performed under a range of fuel pricing assumptions  carbon cost assumptions  plant upgrade and retirement costs  environmental regulation assumptions  and replacement costs 
idaho power published the results of the study with its irp update filed with the ipuc and opuc in february idaho power concluded in its study that both plants should be retained in its resource portfolio 
in addition to the estimated cost savings of retaining the plants under most scenarios  even with the installation of planned controls  retaining the plants also satisfies idaho power desire to maintain a diversified portfolio of generation assets and fuel diversity that can mitigate risk associated with increases in natural gas prices 
however  in the event significant additional operating and maintenance or capital expenditures are necessary at the valmy plant as a result of new environmental requirements  idaho power will conduct a further review to determine whether such investments are economically appropriate  and whether conversion of the facility to a natural gas fired plant would be appropriate 

table of contents endangered species and fisheries matters overview the listing of a species of fish  wildlife  or plants as threatened or endangered under the esa may have an adverse impact on idaho power ability to construct generation  transmission  or distribution facilities or relicense or operate its hydroelectric projects 
when a species is added to the federal list of threatened and endangered species  it is protected from take and from being transported  traded  or sold 
the term take under the esa is interpreted to include harass  harm  pursue  hunt  shoot  wound  kill  trap  capture  or collect  or attempt to engage in any such conduct 
section of the esa also provides that each federal agency shall ensure that any action they authorize  fund  or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat 
the construction of generation  transmission  or distribution facilities and the licensing of idaho power hydroelectric projects can be federally authorized actions that fall under section of the esa 
there are a number of threatened or endangered species within idaho power service territory  which have the potential to impact the ability to construct  or the timing of construction  of infrastructure such as transmission lines 
further  there are a number of esa listed fish and other aquatic species located in waterways in which idaho power has hydroelectric facilities  including fall chinook salmon  bull trout  bliss rapids snail  and snake river physa snail 
to date  efforts to protect these and other listed species have not significantly affected generation levels at any of idaho power hydroelectric facilities 
however  the ongoing relicensing of the hcc presents endangered species and fisheries issues that may require generation or other operational adjustments 
these adjustments may reduce the generation output or operating costs and hence the economics of the plants  potentially causing idaho power to rely on more expensive sources for power generation or market purchases 
esa developments related to specific species slickspot peppergrass this southwestern idaho plant species was listed as threatened by the usfws in in may  the usfws issued a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the slickspot peppergrass and proposed to designate approximately  acres of critical habitat in four southeast idaho counties 
approximately percent of the plant species is located on federal land owned by the blm and the us department of defense 
to date the usfws has yet to issue a final designation of critical habitat 
in august  a federal district court in idaho issued a decision vacating and remanding the usfws decision to list slickspot peppergrass 
the blm is now treating the species as a proposed species under esa and will confer with the usfws until a final decision is made 
parts of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission lines will cross blm land upon which this species is located 
the listing of the slickspot peppergrass will require that idaho power engage in an esa section consultation with the usfws  which will increase the cost of the transmission projects and potentially delay the receipt of a permit for construction 
greater sage grouse the greater sage grouse is considered a candidate species under the esa  which allows land management agencies to implement additional conservation measures 
in march  the usfws announced that listing of the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered under the esa is warranted but precluded by higher priority listing actions 
on february   a federal district court in idaho issued an order denying a request to expedite the listing of the greater sage grouse under the esa 
as a result  the usfws has until to make a final listing determination under the esa 
on february   the same court issued an order holding that the blm had violated the national environmental policy act and other federal laws in connection with the granting of livestock grazing permit renewals in sage grouse habitat 
due to the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission lines  siting of these projects has required more extensive  costly  and time consuming evaluation  permitting  and engineering 
in the event the usfws lists the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered  federal agencies that may authorize rights of way to idaho power would be required to conduct a section consultation under the esa for these transmission projects 
any required additional conservation measures may increase the costs of existing operations and impact the timing for siting  permitting  and constructing the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission lines and other construction and transmission projects 
esa developments related to specific projects hells canyon relicensing project in  the ferc requested initiation of formal consultation under the esa with the nmfs now the noaa and the usfws regarding potential effects of hcc relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species 
formal consultation has yet to be initiated and the noaa and usfws continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant esa listed species 
idaho power continues to cooperate with the usfws  the noaa  and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
in december  idaho power and eleven other parties  including noaa and usfws  involved in the hcc relicensing process entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the hcc on esa listed species pending the relicensing of the project 
at the conclusion of formal consultation and with the issuance of biological opinions by noaa and usfws and a license by the ferc  idaho 
table of contents power may be required to further modify or adjust operations to comply with section of the esa 
the issuance of a final biological opinion during is unlikely 
bliss and lower salmon falls projects as part of a settlement agreement for the current ferc hydroelectric license  idaho power has finalized a snail protection plan for the bliss and lower salmon falls projects in cooperation with the usfws 
idaho power has filed applications with the ferc to amend the licenses for the projects that will maintain operating flexibility at both projects for the remainder of their licenses 
the ferc requested formal consultation with the usfws regarding the license amendments in july the esa section consultation included two listed snails the bliss rapids snail and the snake river physa snail 
the usfws filed its biological opinion with the ferc in november swan falls project in august  the ferc issued a final eis in connection with the relicensing of the sfp 
the snake river physa snail was found in the area during the eis review 
while the biological opinion includes a provision for the incidental take of the snail  idaho power is required to study the status of the snake river physa snail and its habitat within and downstream of the project area for the term of the new license 
boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission projects as noted above  the existence of slickspot peppergrass and the greater sage grouse in the proposed routes for these projects is impacting  and idaho power expects it to continue to impact  the cost and timing of permitting and construction of the projects 
climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions overview long term climate change could significantly affect idaho power business in a variety of ways  including changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand and energy loads  extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages  maintenance costs  and the need for additional backup systems  and can affect the supply of  and demand for  electricity and natural gas  which may impact the price of energy commodities  changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation  legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plants and operations  including restrictions on the construction of new generation resources  the expansion of existing resources  or the operation of generation resources in general  and consumer preference for  and resource planning decisions requiring  renewable or low ghg emitting sources of energy could impact usage of existing generation sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission infrastructure 
some recent initiatives regarding ghg emissions contemplate market based compliance programs  such as cap and trade programs or emission offsets 
however  the regulation of ghg emissions under the caa could result in ghg emission limits on stationary sources that do not provide market based compliance options 
such a program could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal  as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because many new technologies for reducing co emissions from coal  including carbon capture and storage  are still in the development stage and are not yet proven 
emission standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  which may accelerate the retirement of coal fired units 
due in part to the uncertainty of future ghg regulations  in its irp idaho power did not include any new conventional coal resources in its resource portfolios 
a variety of factors contribute to the financial  regulatory  and logistical uncertainties related to ghg reductions  including the specific ghg emissions limits  the timing of implementation of these limits  the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be purchased  the purchase price of emissions allowances  the development and commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions  the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance  provisions for cost containment if any  the impact on coal and natural gas prices  and cost recovery through rates 
accordingly  idaho power cannot predict the effect on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows of any ghg emission or other global climate change requirements that may be adopted  although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be substantial 
a more detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change follows 
national and international ghg initiatives there is concern both nationally and internationally about climate change and the possible contribution of ghg emissions to climate change 
in support of international efforts to reduce ghg emissions  in january the obama administration pledged to cut ghg emissions in the united states from levels by percent by and percent by other communications from the obama administration have proposed the adoption of a clean 
table of contents energy standard in the us  calling for percent of american energy to come from clean sources by further  climate change regulation has been a recent priority of the us congress 
in prior legislative sessions  legislation in both the us house and senate was introduced to enact a comprehensive climate change program  but these attempts were unsuccessful 
at the same time  legislation has also been introduced seeking to amend the caa to prohibit the epa from promulgating regulations on the emissions of ghgs to address climate change and excluding ghgs from the definition of an air pollutant for purposes of addressing climate change 
neither areas of focus have culminated in legislation and have led to greater uncertainty as to the direction of ghg regulation 
at the same time  the epa has become increasingly active in the regulation of ghgs 
the epa endangerment finding in that ghgs threaten public health and welfare resulted in enactment of a series of epa regulations to address ghg emissions 
the epa has issued final rules regulating ghg emissions under the new source review nsr prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v operating permit programs under the caa 
specifically  in may the epa issued the tailoring rule  which set thresholds for ghg emissions that define when permits are required for new and existing industrial facilities 
the final rule tailors the requirements of these caa permitting programs to limit which facilities will be required to obtain psd and title v permits 
additionally  in december the epa issued a series of final regulations for ghg emissions designed to ensure that industrial facilities can obtain caa permits for ghg emissions  and that facilities emitting ghgs at levels below those established in the tailoring rule do not need federal caa permits 
the first phase of the rules took effect in january and required imposition of best available control technology bact for ghg emissions if a new major source or modification of an existing major source is projected to result in ghg emissions of at least  tons per year co equivalent 
in addition  title v permit renewals or modifications for existing major sources must include applicable requirements relating to ghgs 
lawsuits opposing epa endangerment finding and tailoring rule were unsuccessful 
while the rules are complex  idaho power believes that its owned and co owned generation plants are  as of the date of this report  in compliance with the new ghg tailoring rules 
in addition  in april  the epa proposed new source performance standards nsps limiting co emissions from new electric utility generating units egus fired by fossil fuels 
the proposed requirements  which are limited to new sources  would require new fossil fuel fired egus greater than mw to meet an output based standard of  pounds of co per mwh 
the epa did not propose standards of performance for existing egus whose co emissions increase as a result of installation of pollution controls for conventional pollutants 
while idaho power does not expect the new nsps to impact its existing generation facilities  if promulgated the new rule would impact the cost effectiveness of developing new generation units 
state and regional ghg initiatives on a regional level  there are a number of initiatives  including the western regional climate action initiative  considering market based mechanisms to reduce ghg emissions 
separately  in august the oregon legislature enacted legislation setting goals of reducing ghg levels to percent below levels by and at least percent below levels by oregon imposes ghg emission reporting requirements on facilities emitting  metric tons or more of co equivalent annually 
the mechanism was implemented in two phases  with title v sources and entities with an air discharge permit required to start reporting emissions in and all other sources required to start reporting emissions in the boardman coal fired power plant  in which idaho power is a percent owner  is subject to and in compliance with oregon ghg reporting requirements 
the state of idaho has not passed legislation specifically regulating ghgs  but in may governor otter issued executive order  which directed the idaho department of environmental quality to work with the state government to implement ghg reductions within each agency  complete a statewide emissions inventory  and provide recommendations to the governor  among other tasks 
wyoming and nevada similarly have not enacted legislation to regulate ghg emissions and do not have a reporting requirement  but are members of the climate registry  a national  voluntary ghg emission reporting system 
the climate registry is a collaboration aimed at developing and managing a common ghg emission reporting system across states  provinces  and tribes to track ghg emissions nationally 
all states for which idaho power has traditional fuel plants operating ie idaho  oregon  wyoming  and nevada are members of the climate registry 
idaho power voluntary ghg reduction initiatives despite the current absence of a national mandatory ghg reduction program  idaho power is engaged in voluntary ghg emission intensity reduction efforts 
also  idaho power has voluntarily submitted information to the carbon disclosure project  an independent  not for profit organization that claims the largest database of corporate climate change information in the world 
idaho power estimated co emission intensity lbs mwh from its generation facilities as submitted to the carbon disclosure project was     and  lbs mwh for     and  respectively 

table of contents in  idaho power and ida west together ranked as the th lowest emitter of co per mwh produced and the th lowest emitter of co by tons of emissions among the nation largest electricity producers  according to a july collaborative report from ceres  the natural resources defense council  and other entities using publicly reported generation and emissions data 
according to the report  out of the companies named  idaho power and ida west together ranked as the th largest power producer based on fossil fuel  nuclear  and renewable energy facility total electricity generation 
public nuisance related suits for ghgs in june  the us supreme court held that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear federal common law nuisance claims relating to ghg emissions because the legal authority to regulate ghgs has been delegated by congress to the epa  not to federal courts 
the court did not address  however  whether state common law nuisance claims would also be barred by the federal caa 
accordingly  the supreme court decision did not completely eliminate the potential for future nuisance related suits for ghg emissions 
clean air act developments overview in addition to the caa developments related to ghg emissions described above  several other regulatory programs developed under the caa impact idaho power 
these include the final utility maximum available control technology mact rule  national ambient air quality standards naaqs  nsr psd rules  and the regional haze rule 
final mact rule the caa requires the epa to develop industry based standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants  or haps 
these standards are referred to as the mact rules 
in february  the epa issued final mact rules to control emissions of mercury and other haps from coal and oil fired egus under the caa and new nsps for fossil fuel fired egus 
the regulations impose mact and nsps on all coal fired egus and replace the former clean air mercury rule 
specifically  the regulations set numeric emission limitations on coal fired egus for total particulate matter a surrogate for non mercury haps  hydrogen chloride  and mercury 
in addition  the regulations impose a work practice standard for organic haps  including dioxins and furans 
for the revised nsps  for egus commencing construction of a new source after publication of the final rule  the epa has established amended emission limitations for particulate matter  sulfur dioxide  and nitrogen oxides 
the compliance deadline for the new mact rules could be as early as mercury continuous emission monitoring systems have been installed on all of the coal fired units at the jim bridger  boardman  and valmy generating plants in compliance with the nsps rule 
idaho power is reviewing the mact final rule and is in the process of determining how these regulations will impact the bridger  boardman  and valmy generating plants  including whether those coal fired plants can meet hap limits with current and planned control technologies 
while idaho power does not expect the new nsps to impact its existing generation facilities  the new rules would impact the cost effectiveness of developing new egus 
naaqs the caa requires the epa to set ambient air quality standards for six criteria pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment 
these six pollutants are carbon monoxide  lead  ozone  particulate matter  nitrogen dioxide  and sulfur dioxide 
states are then required to develop emission reduction strategies through state implementation plans  or sips  based on attainment of these ambient air quality standards 
recent developments related to three of these pollutants pm  pm  and pm are relevant to idaho power 
particular matter pm in  the epa adopted naaqs for fine particulate matter of less than micrometers in diameter pm standard  setting an annual limit of micrograms per cubic meter g m  calculated as a three year average 
in  the epa adopted a hour naaqs for pm of g m all of the counties in idaho  nevada  oregon  and wyoming in which idaho power power plants are located have been designated as attainment with these pm standards 
however  on december   the epa released final revisions to the pm naaqs 
the revised annual standard is g m  calculated as a three year average 
the epa retained the existing hour standard of g m now that the pm naaqs has been finalized  states will make recommendations to the epa regarding designations of attainment or non attainment 
states also will be required to review  modify  and supplement their sips  which could require the installation of additional controls and requirements for idaho power coal fired generation plants  depending on the level ultimately finalized 
the revised naaqs would also have an impact on the applicable air permitting requirements for new and modified facilities 
the epa has stated that it plans to issue nonattainment designations by late  with states having until to comply with the standards 
nox 
in  the epa adopted a new naaqs for nox at a level of parts per billion averaged over a hour period 
in connection with the new naaqs  in february the epa issued a final rule designating all of the counties in idaho  nevada  oregon  and wyoming where idaho power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal fired power plant as unclassifiable attainment for nox 
the epa indicated it will review the designations after  when three years of air quality monitoring data are available  and may formally designate the counties as attainment or non attainment for nox 
a designation of non attainment may increase the likelihood that idaho power would be 
table of contents required to install costly pollution control technology at one or more of its plants 
as the designations have not yet been finalized  as of the date of this report idaho power is unable to predict the impact of the naaqs for nox on its operations 
however  the costs of installation and implementation of any additional pollution reduction technology could be substantial 
so in  the epa adopted a new naaqs for so at a level of parts per billion averaged over a one hour period 
in  the states of idaho  nevada  oregon  and wyoming sent letters to the epa recommending that all counties in these states be classified as unclassifiable under the new one hour so naaqs because of a lack of definitive monitoring and modeling data 
because the epa has not yet completed the designation of areas as attaining or not attaining these new naaqs  idaho power is unable to predict what impact the adoption and implementation of these standards may have on its operations  though it does expect at least some increases in capital and operating costs from the standards 
regional haze rules in accordance with federal regional haze rules under the caa  coal fired utility boilers are subject to regional haze best available retrofit technology rh bart if they were built between and and affect any class i wilderness areas 
this includes all four units at the jim bridger and the boardman coal fired plants 
jim bridger plant in december  the wyoming department of environmental quality wdeq issued a rh bart permit to pacificorp as the operator of the jim bridger plant 
the wdeq determined that low nox burners with over fire air is rh bart for nox for all four bridger units and that rh bart is not required for so at the jim bridger plant 
as part of the wdeq long term strategy for regional haze  the permit requires that pacificorp install selective catalytic reduction scr for nox control at jim bridger units and by december  and december   respectively  and submit an application by january  to install add on nox controls at jim bridger units by and by pacificorp has installed low nox burners and nox scrubber upgrades at the plant 
the nox scrubber upgrade project has been completed on all four jim bridger units 
idaho power spent approximately million in for its share of these pollution control projects 
idaho power estimated share of the cost to install scr on jim bridger units and is million 
in addition to the installation costs  installation of scr could require extended maintenance outages 
design and cost estimates for add on nox controls at jim bridger units and are not yet available 
in november  pacificorp and the wdeq signed a settlement agreement under which pacificorp agreed to the timing and nature of controls described above 
the settlement agreement is conditioned on the epa ultimately approving those portions of the wyoming regional haze state implementation plan rh sip that are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement 
in may  the epa proposed to partially reject wyoming regional haze sip for nox reduction at the jim bridger plant  instead proposing to substitute the epa own rh bart determination and its federal implementation plan fip 
the epa primary proposal would result in an acceleration of the installation of scr additions at bridger units and to within five years after the fip  or a sip revised to be consistent with the proposed fip  is adopted by the epa 
in november  the epa approved the general provisions of the wdeq rh sip 
however  in december the epa announced that it would re propose the plant specific nox control provisions of its rh fip in march and would not finalize the rh fip until september boardman plant following the introduction of various plans and an extensive public process  in december the oregon environmental quality commission oeqc approved a plan to cease coal fired operations at the boardman power plant not later than december  the rules implementing the plan were approved by the epa and published in the federal register in july  and require the installation of a number of emissions controls 
the new rules repeal the oeqc bart rule  which would have allowed continued operation of the boardman plant through at least with installation of a more extensive suite of emissions controls 
the estimated combined total capital cost of the required controls under the plan approved by the oeqc for controlling mercury  nox and nox is approximately million 
idaho power is a percent owner of the boardman plant  and thus idaho power estimated share of the capital cost is million  which is in addition to normal capital expenditures and maintenance costs 
as of december   idaho power had incurred charges of million  including afudc  of its total estimated share of the capital cost for the new controls 
nsr psd nsr psd is a preconstruction permitting program that requires a stationary source of air pollution to obtain a permit before beginning construction 
the purpose of the program is to ensure that air quality is not significantly degraded by the addition of new and modified facilities  industrial boilers  and power plants 
under current nsr provisions of the caa  any facility that emits regulated pollutants is required to obtain a permit from the epa or a state regulatory equivalent before beginning the construction of a stationary source that will emit regulated pollutants  or before modifying an existing stationary source that will increase its emission levels 
since  the epa and the us department of justice have been pursuing a 
table of contents national enforcement initiative focused on the compliance status of coal fired power plants with the nsr permitting requirements and nsps under the caa 
this initiative has resulted in both enforcement litigation and significant settlements with a large number of public utilities and other owners of coal fired power plants across the country 
as part of an industry wide assessment of compliance with nsr and nsps  epa has sought information from a number of utilities regarding their coal fired generating facilities 
in  the epa sent information requests pursuant to the caa to the jim bridger plant  seeking information relevant to nsr and nsps compliance 
additional requests were received by the valmy plant in and the boardman plant in  with a follow up request for information in in september  the epa issued a notice of violation to portland general electric company  the operator of the boardman plant  alleging that pge violated the nsps under section of the caa and operating permit requirements under title v of the caa at the boardman coal fired plant as a result of certain modifications made to the plant in and to date  the epa has not taken action on the notice of violation  and a related private lawsuit under the caa was settled in potential regulation of coal combustion residuals ccrs the resource conservation and recovery act is a federal statute regulating the generation  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
in december  the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties 
in response  in june the epa proposed regulations governing the disposal and management of ccrs 
the epa requested comments on two options for regulating ccrs 
the first option would regulate ccrs as a new special waste subject to many of the requirements for hazardous waste  while the second would regulate ccrs in a manner similar to typical solid waste  subject to fewer and less stringent requirements 
to date the epa has not issued final regulations 
both of the epa proposed options represent a shift toward more comprehensive and potentially more expensive requirements for ccr management and disposal 
if this or other new legislation or regulations increase the cost of managing and disposing of ccrs or create additional liability with respect to historic disposal practices  they could have an adverse impact on idaho power consolidated financial position  operations  or cash flows 
however  the financial and operational consequences cannot be determined until final legislation is passed or regulations are issued 
regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs the toxic substances control act is a federal statute providing the epa with the authority to  among other things  require use restrictions relating to chemical substances including pcbs 
generally  pcbs are prohibited from use  but some uses of pcbs such as in electrical equipment remain authorized under certain conditions 
in april  the epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking stating that it is considering revisiting the authorization allowing the continued use of pcbs in equipment 
if new regulations require the replacement of existing equipment  they could have an adverse effect on idacorp and idaho power financial condition and results of operations 
however  the financial and operational consequences cannot be determined until final regulations are issued 
idaho power currently records asset retirement obligation liabilities and associated regulatory assets for the estimated retirement costs of equipment containing pcbs 
final regulations could accelerate idaho power estimated timing for the retirement of equipment with pcbs 
cwa potential section b regulation of cooling water intake structures the cwa generally prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into waters of the united states without a permit 
pollutants are broadly defined to include changes in temperature 
section b of the cwa requires that national pollutant discharge elimination system permits for facilities with cooling water intake structures ensure that the location  design  construction  and capacity of the structures employ the best technology available bta to minimize harmful impacts on the environment  such as the removal of fish  fish larvae  marine mammals and other aquatic organisms from waters of the us in march  the epa issued a proposed rule that would establish requirements under section b of the cwa for all existing power generation facilities and existing manufacturing and industrial facilities that withdraw more than million gallons per day of water from waters of the us and use at least percent of the water they withdraw exclusively for cooling purposes 
the proposed rule establishes national requirements applicable to cooling water intake structures at these facilities that reflect the bta for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
an existing facility may choose one of two options for meeting bta requirements for impingement mortality under this proposed rule 
the owner or operator may monitor to show the specified performance standards for impingement mortality of fish and shellfish have been met  or they may demonstrate that the intake velocity meets specified design criteria 
for entrainment mortality  this proposed rule establishes requirements for studies and information as part of the permit application  and then establishes a process by which the bta for entrainment mortality would be implemented at each facility 
since issuing the proposed rule  epa has collected more than studies from 
table of contents the public with additional biological data  some of which may help address the intent of the proposed rule to reduce damage to ecosystems while accommodating site specific circumstances and providing cost effective options for compliance 
based on the qualification criteria  idaho power expects that the new requirements would apply to the jim bridger plant  but it is unable to determine the potential increased costs that may result from implementation of the rule until the final rule is issued and cost studies are performed 
the epa has announced it intends to finalize the rules by june idaho power is also addressing cwa issues associated with the relicensing of its hcc 
see relicensing of hydroelectric projects in this md a for additional information on the impact of the cwa on that relicensing effort 
critical accounting policies and estimates when preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  idacorp s and idaho power s management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates 
management believes the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
accounting for rate regulation entities that meet specific conditions are required by gaap to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities 
idaho power must satisfy three conditions to apply regulatory accounting an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
idaho power has determined that it meets these conditions  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating idaho power 
the primary effect of this policy is that idaho power had recorded billion of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  idaho power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates  but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies 
if future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable  or if idaho power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting  or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities  idaho power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities 
either circumstance could have a material effect on idaho power s financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes idacorp and idaho power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
the interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income  cash flows  and tax related assets and liabilities 
idaho power provides deferred income taxes related to its plant assets for the difference between income tax depreciation and book depreciation used for financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes for other items are provided for the temporary differences between the income tax and financial accounting treatment of such items 
unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance  deferred income taxes are not provided for those income tax temporary differences where the prescribed regulatory accounting methods  or flow through  direct idaho power to recognize the tax impacts currently for rate making and financial reporting 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to income taxes 

table of contents asset impairment available for sale securities idaho power is required to evaluate available for sale securities periodically to determine whether a decline in fair value below cost is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as a realized loss 
two significant factors that are considered when evaluating investments for impairment are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
idaho power has investments in four mutual funds that experienced a significant decline in fair value in idaho power s investments had lost between percent and percent of their value  primarily during the stock market downturn in september and october  and had been in loss positions from to months at december  because of the severity of the declines in value  idaho power determined that the loss in value was other than temporary and recorded a pre tax loss of million in the fourth quarter of at december  and  the fair values of these investments were at or above their new cost bases and no impairment was recorded 
equity method investments ifs has affordable housing investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for one investment which is consolidated  these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and have a net book value of million 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded for these investments is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
impairment analyses are performed on these investments when indicators of impairment are noted 
an immaterial impairment was recorded on one of the ida west joint ventures in  and no impairments were recorded in or in these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future revenues  cash flows  and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
pension and other postretirement benefits idaho power maintains a tax qualified  noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the senior management security plan smsp  and a postretirement benefit plan consisting of health care and death benefits 
the costs idacorp and idaho power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets  and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends  and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates  and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and idaho power determined the discount rate for each plan through the construction of hypothetical portfolios of bonds selected from high quality corporate bonds available as of december   with maturities matching the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be decreased to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and idaho power believes the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 
the long term rate of return used to calculate the pension expense will be percent  which is the same assumption as was used for gross net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  including amounts deferred as regulatory assets see discussion below and amounts allocated to capitalized labor 
for  gross pension and other postretirement benefit 
table of contents costs are expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of rate increase on net periodic benefit cost effect of rate decrease on net periodic benefit cost additionally a percent increase in the plans discount rates would have resulted in a million decrease in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of december  a percent decrease in the plans discount rates would have resulted in a million increase in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of december  idaho power made contributions of million  million  and million to the pension plan in   and respectively 
idaho power required contributions to the pension plan during are estimated to be zero 
under the smsp  idaho power makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
benefit payments are expected to be million in and averaged million per year from to postretirement benefit plan contributions are expected to be million in  and averaged million from to the ipuc has authorized idaho power to account for its defined benefit pension plan expense on a cash basis  and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for idaho power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
in  idaho power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
at december   a total of million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset 
approximately million is expected to be deferred in idaho power recorded pension expense in   and of million  million  and million  respectively 
refer to note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans 
contingent liabilities an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
idacorp and idaho power have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters 
if the recognition criteria have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements there have been no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material impact on idacorp or idaho power results of operations or financial condition 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and idaho power are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk  and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments  and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices  and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and idaho power manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and idaho power had million and million  respectively  in net floating rate debt 
the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
assuming no change in financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher than the average rate on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for idaho power 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and idaho power each had billion in fixed rate debt  with a fair market value equal to billion 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the companies to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for both idacorp and idaho power if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk idaho power exposure to changes in commodity prices is related to its ongoing utility operations that produce electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
to supplement its generation resources and balance its supply of power with the demand of its retail customers  idaho power participates in the wholesale marketplace 
these purchased power arrangements allow idaho power to respond to fluctuations in the demand for electricity and variability in generating plant operations 
idaho power also enters into arrangements for the purchase of fuel for natural gas and coal fired generating plants 
idaho power anticipates that the additional volume of natural gas needed to operate the langley gulch power plant will increase its exposure in the future to natural gas commodity price risk 
these contracts for the purchase of power and fuel expose idaho power to commodity price risk 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and cost of production 
other factors include the occurrence and timing of demand peaks due to seasonal  daily  and hourly power demand  power supply  power transmission capacity  changes in federal and state regulation and compliance obligations  fuel supplies  and market liquidity 
idaho power s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the pca mechanisms in idaho and oregon 
therefore  the primary objectives of idaho power s energy purchase and sale activity are to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 
idaho power has adopted a risk management program  which has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc  designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
idaho power s energy risk management policy policy and associated standards implementing the policy describe a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of selected idaho power officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the idaho power board of directors and to the cag  and idaho power s audit committee is responsible for approving the policy and associated standards 
the rmc is also responsible for conducting an ongoing general assessment of the appropriateness of idaho power s strategies for energy risk management activities 
in its risk management process  idaho power considers both demand side and supply side options consistent with its irp 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical and financial forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
idaho power does not engage in trading activities for non retail purposes 

table of contents the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total monthly dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan based on factors such as forecasted resource availability  stream flows  and load  and orders risk mitigating actions  including resource optimization and hedging strategies  dictated by the limits stated in the policy to bring exposures within pre established risk guidelines 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
idaho power representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
credit risk idaho power is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
idaho power is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy  or complete financial settlement for market activities 
idaho power mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  and reporting credit risk using appropriate contractual arrangements  and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash  or letters of credit 
idaho power maintains a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits 
the use of performance assurance collateral in the form of cash  letters of credit  or guarantees is common industry practice 
idaho power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and or posted with certain counterparties 
as of december   idaho power had posted no performance assurance collateral 
should idaho power experience a reduction in its credit rating on idaho power s unsecured debt to below investment grade  idaho power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post performance assurance collateral 
counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions 
based upon idaho power s current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of december   the approximate amount of collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately million 
idaho power actively monitors the portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral calls  through sensitivity analysis  to minimize capital requirements 
idaho power is obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its service area 
credit risk for idaho power s retail customers is managed by credit and collection policies that are governed by rules issued by the ipuc or opuc 
idaho power records a provision for uncollectible accounts  based upon historical experience  to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers 
idaho power will continue to monitor the impact of the current economic conditions on nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to its provision for uncollectible accounts 
idaho utility customer relations rules prohibit idaho power from terminating electric service during the months of december through february to any residential customer who declares that he or she is unable to pay in full for utility service and whose household includes children  elderly  or infirm persons 
idaho power s provision for uncollectible accounts could be affected by changes in future prices as well as changes in ipuc or opuc regulations 
equity price risk idacorp and idaho power are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their defined benefit pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of idaho power  and other equity investments at idaho power 
during  the fair value of the defined benefit pension plan s assets increased  however  increases in the benefit liabilities were greater than the increases in the plan s assets  therefore resulting in an increase in future amounts required to be contributed to the plan 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities as of december
