non us gaap financial measures throughout this annual report  we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful  useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance 
in addition to the us gaap presentation of net loss  we show certain statutory reporting information and other non us gaap financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers 
these measures are operating loss  gross premiums written  net premiums written and underwriting ratios 
following is a list of non us gaap measures found throughout this report with their definitions  relationships to us gaap measures and explanations of their importance to our operations 
kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis operating loss income operating loss income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues 
revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations  but are not subtotaled by segment 
however  this information is available in total and by segment in note  segmented information  to the consolidated financial statements  regarding reportable segment information 
the nearest comparable us gaap measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit which  in addition to operating loss income  includes net investment income  net realized gains  other than temporary impairment loss  loss gain on change in fair value of debt  other income  general and administrative expenses  restructuring expense  interest expense  amortization of certain intangible assets  goodwill impairment  gain on buy back of debt  and equity in net loss income of investee 
gross premiums written while net premiums earned is the related us gaap measure used in the consolidated statements of operations  gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums  but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue 
we use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in insurance underwriting 
net premiums written while net premiums earned is the related us gaap measure used in the consolidated statements of operations  net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums  but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue 
we use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in insurance underwriting 
underwriting ratios kingsway  like many insurance companies  analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss  expense and combined ratios 
the loss ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
a combined ratio below demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over demonstrates an underwriting loss 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined 
the critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments  valuation of deferred income taxes  valuation of intangible assets  goodwill recoverability  deferred acquisition costs  and fair value assumptions for debt obligations 
provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses a significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events 
as such  the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined 
the process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals  including the opinions of the company actuaries 
further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses section of part i  item of this annual report and note  unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  to the consolidated financial statements 
kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis factors affecting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment  actuarial studies  professional experience and expertise of the company claims departments personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims  the quality of the data used for projection purposes  existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices  the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs  court decisions  economic conditions and public attitudes 
during  the company moved responsibility for evaluating the adequacy of our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our policies and vehicle service agreements to an external process for most of our operating subsidiaries 
the provision is evaluated by the company actuaries with the results then shared with management  which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
in the year end actuarial review process  an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and iws 
unpaid losses  allocated loss adjustment expenses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are separately analyzed by line of business or coverage by accident year 
a wide range of actuarial methods are utilized in order to appropriately measure ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense costs 
these methods include paid loss development  incurred loss development and frequency severity method 
reasonability tests such as ultimate loss ratio trends and ultimate allocated loss adjustment expense to ultimate loss are also performed prior to selection of the final provision 
the provision is indicated by line of business or coverage and is separated into case reserves  reserves for losses incurred but not reported ibnr and a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
because the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  current provisions may need to be updated 
adjustments to the provision  both favorable and unfavorable  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated 
the company actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid point of the high and low estimates of the range 
valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments our equity investments are recorded at fair value using quoted prices from active markets 
for fixed maturities  we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets  quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments  benchmark interest rates  broker quotes and other relevant inputs 
we do not have any investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs 
any change in the estimated fair value of our investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss we have recorded  which could change the amount we have recorded for our investments and other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first in first out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations 
premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income 
the establishment of an other than temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates 
we perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other than temporary 
the analysis includes some or all of the following procedures  as applicable identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months  identifying other circumstances which management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions  obtaining a valuation analysis from third party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market based valuation techniques  reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period  assessing if declines in market value are other than temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third party rating agencies  assessing if declines in market value are other than temporary for any debt instrument with a non investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record  determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other than temporary based on the analyses performed  and assessing the company ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered 
kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis the risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other than temporary include  but may not be limited to  the following the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect  the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends  the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company financial situation  and the debt service pattern of non investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company unknown underlying financial problems 
the company did not recognize any impairment related to its fixed maturities or equity investments that was considered other than temporary for the years ended december  and as further discussed in the results of continuing operations section below  the company recorded write downs for other than temporary impairments related to investment in investee and other investments of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  valuation of deferred income taxes the provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
in making this determination  management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances  including the company past and anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists 
cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the company maintains a valuation allowance of million  million of which relates to its us deferred income taxes 
the largest component of the us deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of the continued losses of the company us operations 
uncertainty over the company ability to utilize these losses over the short term has led the company to record a valuation allowance 
future events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard  the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion were reached 
valuation of intangible assets intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in force vsa in force  database  customer related relationships  and non compete agreement 
a discounted cash flow analysis was used to determine the fair value of the vsa in force asset 
the multi period excess earnings method was used to determine the fair value of the customer related intangible asset 
a form of the income method  known as the with and without method  was utilized to determine the fair values of the database and non compete agreement intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist of insurance licenses  renewal rights and trade name 
intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of december  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  by applying a fair value based test 
management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write down 
this includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units 
management then compares the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset  an impairment is recorded 
additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in note  intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 
kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis goodwill recoverability goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of december  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  by applying a fair value based test 
in determining fair value  valuation models such as price to earnings ratios and other multiples are used 
management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of a reporting unit that may affect any resulting impairment write down 
this includes assumptions regarding fluctuations in future earnings from the reporting units 
management then compares the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  a second step of impairment is performed to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount 
accordingly  the company tested goodwill associated with each of its reporting units at december  and based on the assessment  for the year ended december   an impairment provision of million was recorded against the goodwill of the company related to the itasca financial  llc acquisition that occurred in the company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill related to the itasca acquisition exceeded its fair value and  therefore  was not recoverable 
the determination that the fair value of the itasca goodwill was less than its carrying value resulted primarily from a decline in the quoted value of kingsway common stock as compared to the book value per share of the company at december  additional information regarding our goodwill is included in note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business 
acquisition costs  primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements  are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements 
management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset 
for insurance underwriting  a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income 
fair value assumptions for debt obligations our linked return of capital lroc preferred units  senior unsecured debentures and subordinated debt are measured and reported at fair value 
the fair value of the lroc preferred units is based on quoted market prices  and the fair value of the subordinated debt is estimated using an internal model based on significant market observable inputs 
the fair values of senior unsecured debentures  for which no active market exists  are derived from quoted market prices of similar instruments or other third party evidence 
any change in the estimated fair value of our debt is reflected in the gain or loss on change in fair value of debt we record in the consolidated statements of operations and in the carrying value for our debt on our consolidated balance sheets

management discussion and analysis results of continuing operations a reconciliation of total segment operating loss to net loss for the years ended december  and is presented in table below table segment loss income for the years ended december in millions of dollars change segment operating loss income insurance underwriting insurance services total segment operating loss net investment income net realized gains other than temporary impairment loss loss gain on change in fair value of debt other income and expenses not allocated to segments  net interest expense amortization of intangible assets not allocated to segments goodwill impairment gain on buy back of debt equity in net loss income of investee loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss loss from continuing operations  net loss and diluted loss per share in  we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million per diluted share compared to a loss of million per diluted share in the loss from continuing operations in is attributable to operating losses in insurance underwriting  corporate general expenses  interest expense  and loss on the change in fair value of debt 
the loss in is largely due to insurance underwriting operating loss  corporate general expenses and interest expense  partially offset by the gain on the change in fair value of debt 
in  we incurred a net loss of million compared to million in the diluted loss per share was for compared to a diluted loss per share of for insurance underwriting for the year ended december   insurance underwriting gross premiums written were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a increase 
net premiums written decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  net premiums earned decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in gross premiums written is the result of modestly increased non standard automobile premium volumes across all of our non standard automobile companies as well as new premium volume at maison  which began operations in november of kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis  partially offset by a decrease in commercial automobile premium volumes at amigo reflecting the actions begun by the company during the fourth quarter of to place amigo into voluntary run off 
the decrease in net premiums written and earned is primarily the result of quota share reinsurance agreements entered into by mendota and mendakota for the six months ended december  and amigo for the twelve months ended december  the insurance underwriting operating loss decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses  as reflected in the loss ratio  against a smaller volume of net premiums earned 
the insurance underwriting loss ratio for was compared to for due to decreasing ultimate loss estimates for current and prior accident years 
this improvement was primarily driven by the increased premium rate adequacy which insurance underwriting implemented throughout  which is having a positive influence on the loss ratio for losses incurred during this improvement more than offset the unfavorable development of million recorded during in the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for losses incurred as of december  the unfavorable development recorded in is primarily due to the increase in property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of million as a result of the insurance underwriting restructuring announced by the company on september  the insurance underwriting expense ratio was in compared with in the increase in the expense ratio for the year ended december  is a derivative effect of the decrease in net premiums written and earned cited above which has made it more difficult for insurance underwriting to cover its fixed overhead expenses 
in response to the shrinkage in its volume of business  insurance underwriting has been taking steps to reduce its fixed overhead expenses 
the insurance underwriting combined ratio was in compared with in  reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and expense ratios 
the insurance underwriting operating loss includes policy fee income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  however  when calculating expense and combined ratios under us gaap  policy fee income is excluded 
insurance services the insurance services service fee and commission income increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of iws in following its acquisition effective november  see note  acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the iws acquisition 
the insurance services operating income increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this improvement is derived primarily from higher revenues and operating income as a result of the inclusion of iws during  as noted above 
insurance services operating income includes amortization expense of million related to its vsa in force intangible asset 
net investment income net investment income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily a result of a decline in the company total investments  cash and cash equivalents which resulted from reduced volumes of business and acceleration of claim payments in insurance underwriting 
additionally  yields on fixed maturities remain at historically low levels such that reinvestment of maturing investments occurs at yields lower than the yields on the maturing investments 
net realized gains the company incurred net realized gains in of million compared to million in the net realized gains in resulted from realized gains from the liquidation of equity investments and fixed maturities in insurance underwriting offset by realized losses of million related to the sale of atlas financial holdings  inc atlas common stock 
see note  investment in investee  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the atlas common stock sale 
the net realized gains in primarily resulted from the liquidation of fixed maturities in insurance underwriting

management discussion and analysis other than temporary impairment loss as a result of the analysis performed by the company to determine declines in market value that are other than temporary  the company recorded write downs for other than temporary impairments related to investment in investee and other investments of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the company did not incur impairment losses for the year ended december  related to investment in investee and other investments 
there were no write downs related to fixed maturities and equity investments for other than temporary impairments for the years ended december  and december  loss gain on change in fair value of debt the loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to million in compared to a gain of million in the loss is primarily due to an increase in the fair values of the company subordinated debt and lroc preferred units 
the gain reflects a decrease in fair values  primarily during the second and third quarters of  of the company outstanding debt 
other income and expenses not allocated to segments  net other income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to million more of professional fees  including outside legal and audit fees  recorded in than in  million more of write off  depreciation  and amortization of computer hardware and software in than in  and million more of general and administrative expenses recorded in than interest expense interest expense for was million compared to million in the increase is the result of higher interest rates on the company subordinated debt in compared to goodwill impairment we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from our annual review of goodwill recoverability 
based on our assessment  we concluded that the carrying value of the itasca acquisition goodwill exceeded its fair value

management discussion and analysis investments portfolio composition all of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents and investments with a carrying value of million 
as of december   we held an investments portfolio comprised primarily of fixed maturities issued by the us government  government agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
investments held by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type  quality and concentration of investments 
our us operations typically invest in us dollar denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
table below summarizes the carrying value of investments  including cash and cash equivalents  at the dates indicated 
table carrying value of investments  including cash and cash equivalents as of december in millions of dollars  except for percentages type of investment of total of total fixed maturities us government  government agencies and authorities canadian government states municipalities and political subdivisions mortgage backed asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations corporate total fixed maturities equity investments limited liability investments other investments short term investments total investments cash and cash equivalents total liquidity and cash flow risk table below summarizes the fair value by contractual maturities of the fixed maturities portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  at december  and table fair value of fixed maturities by contractual maturity date as of december in millions of dollars of total of total due in less than one year due in one through five years due after five through ten years due after ten years total kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis at december   of fixed maturities  including treasury bills  government bonds and corporate bonds  had contractual maturities of five years or less 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
the company holds cash and high grade short term assets which  along with fixed maturities  management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis 
in the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to our policyholders and customers  we believe that the high quality  liquid investments in the portfolios provide us with sufficient liquidity 
market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices 
given our us operations typically invest in us dollar denominated instruments and own a relatively insignificant investment in equity instruments  our primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates 
because the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity  periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact our financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments 
during periods of rising interest rates  the market value of the existing fixed maturities will generally decrease 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation 
credit risk arises from our positions in short term investments  corporate debt instruments and government bonds 
the investment and capital committee of the board of directors is responsible for the oversight of key investment policies and limits 
these policies and limits are subject to annual review and approval by the investment and capital committee 
the investment and capital committee is also responsible for ensuring that these policies are implemented and that procedures are in place to manage and control credit risk 
table below summarizes the composition of the fair value of fixed maturities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  at december  and  by rating as assigned by standard and poor s p or moody investors service moody 
fixed maturities consist of predominantly high quality instruments in corporate and government bonds with approximately of those investments rated a or better at december  the increase in bbb baa rated instruments is due to reinvestment of cash into fixed maturities and is not due to rating downgrades

further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other than temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section of md a 
as a result of the analysis performed by the company to determine declines in market value that are other than temporary  the company recorded write downs for other than temporary impairments related to investment in investee and other investments of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the company did not incur impairment losses kingsway financial services inc 
management discussion and analysis for the year ended december  related to investment in investee and other investments 
there were no write downs related to fixed maturities and equity investments for other than temporary impairments for the years ended december  and the length of time an individual investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment 
in the case of an individual investment with a maturity date where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding  we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures 
in situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal  the company may elect to sell investments at a loss 
at december   the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and equity investments amounted to million  and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non investment grade fixed maturities 
at each of december  and december   all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary 
fixed maturities in unrealized loss positions continued to pay interest and were not subject to material changes in their respective debt ratings 
we concluded that default risk did not exist at the time and  therefore  the declines in value were considered temporary 
as we have the capacity to hold these investments to maturity  no impairment provision was considered necessary 
limited liability investments the company owns investments in limited liability companies llc and a limited partnership lp that primarily invest in income producing real estate 
the company investments in the llc and lp are reported as limited liability investments in the consolidated balance sheets

the decrease is due to the reduction in the volume of non standard automobile premium written and an acceleration of claim payments which more than offset the addition of million to property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses resulting from prior years adverse development in commercial automobile at december  and  the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our commercial automobile business were million and million  respectively 
this decrease primarily reflects the actions begun by the company during the fourth quarter of to place amigo into voluntary run off as well as the payment of claims related to ucc continuing voluntary run off  offset by the addition of million related to property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses resulting from prior years adverse development in further information regarding amigo and ucc is discussed within liquidity and capital resources below

in  the majority of the unfavorable development is attributable to an increase in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of million at amigo and mendota as part of the company september  announcement that it was restructuring its insurance underwriting and insurance services segments 
the remaining adverse development in is generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends 
original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims 
liquidity and capital resources the purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due 
the liquidity requirements of the company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations  disposal of discontinued operations  investment maturities and income and other returns received on investments 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily for loss and loss adjustment expense payments  debt servicing and other operating expenses 
the timing and amount of payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from our provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  which may create increased liquidity requirements 
cash flows during  the net cash used in operating activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was million 
this use of cash can be explained primarily by the net loss of million and the decrease in the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of million offset by a number of smaller sources of cash
