in february  a concerned stockholder group requested a special meeting as described in the form k 
if the special meeting had resulted in a change in the majority of our board under the terms of the company s credit facility with bank of america  na and keybank national association the lenders  a change in the majority of the board would have constituted a change in control and an event of default  which would have allowed the lenders to cause the debt to be immediately due and payable 
this possibility of a change in the majority representation of the board and consequent event of default under the credit facility  which would have allowed the lenders to cause the debt of million as of december  to become immediately due and payable  raised substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going

infusystem holdings  inc results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues our revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase compared to million for the year ended december   primarily in rental revenues 
the increase in revenues is primarily related to the addition of larger customers  increased penetration into our existing customer accounts and the resolution of the oncology drug shortage affecting certain products which was having a negative effect on new patient start on pumps 
during the fourth quarter of  a major group of third party payors revised their claim processing guidelines that affected all dme providers which pushed some of our claims from in network billed directly to a third party payor to out of network billed directly to the patient thereby increasing revenue based on the higher out of network rates 
conversely  collecting a higher portion of reimbursement directly from patients increases our bad debt expense in selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to million in the prior year 
it represented of revenues in the current year compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the gross margin as a percentage of revenue in was primarily related to the aforementioned increase in rental revenue  specifically third party billings  which generally have a higher gross profit margin 
provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  it represented of revenues in the current year compared to in the prior year 
the increase  as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of the aforementioned recent changes by a major third party payor of their in network process  which resulted in an additional write off of approximately million in the three months ended december  amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million  which was consistent with the prior year end selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december   our selling and marketing expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses is primarily related to expenses incurred by the increase in associated revenues as well as increased retention and travel costs in the sales and marketing departments

general and administrative expenses have increased from to of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year

additional increases were mainly attributed to the aforementioned increase in finance and accounting staff and several other general and administrative accounts 
these costs were partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized stock compensation expense of million  for which the requisite service was not rendered 
other income and expenses during the year ended december   we recorded no gain or loss on derivatives compared to a gain of million during the year ended december  included in the year ended december  was the gain from the expiration on april  of all outstanding warrants to purchase common stock

inflation management believes that there has been no material effect on our operations or financial condition as a result of inflation or changing prices of our ambulatory infusion pumps during the period from december  through december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of availability on the revolving line of credit compared to million and million of availability on the revolving line of credit at december  the increase in cash was primarily related to positive cash flows from operating activities offset by capital expenditures of million  professional fees of million  strategic alternative fees of million and payments on capital leases of million 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue offset by better management of payment terms in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to lower capital expenditures during the year and no acquisitions of intangible and other assets 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the change was primarily related to additional borrowing due to a new debt agreement with wells fargo 
management believes the current funds  together with expected cash flows from ongoing operations as well as the million available as of december  on the revolving credit facility referred to below  are sufficient to fund our current operations 
on november   we entered into a credit facility with wells fargo as administrative agent and pennantpark as lenders

table of contents contractual obligations infusystem holding  inc is a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the exchange act and is not required to provide this information 
contingent liabilities we do not have any contingent liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  including the following revenue recognition  which includes contractual allowances  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  warrants and derivative financial instruments  income taxes  and goodwill valuation 
management relies on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable in making its judgment and estimates 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management believes its application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described under the heading summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments revenue recognition we recognize revenue for selling  renting and servicing new and pre owned infusion pumps and other medical equipment to oncology practices as well as other alternate site settings including home care and home infusion providers  skilled nursing facilities  pain centers and others  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement is determined to exist  and collectability is reasonably assured  when we receive a physician s written order and assignment of benefits  signed by the physician and patient  respectively  we have verified actual pump usage and we receive patient acknowledgement of assignment of benefits 
we recognize rental revenue from electronic infusion pumps as earned  normally on a month to month basis 
pump rentals are billed at our established rates  which often differ from contractually allowable rates provided by third party payors such as medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance carriers 
all billings to third party payors are recorded net of provision for contractual adjustments to arrive at net revenues 
we perform an analysis to estimate sales returns and record an allowance 
this estimate is based on historical sales returns 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement 
table of contents amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
due to continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
our largest contracted payor is medicare  which accounted for approximately of our gross billings for ambulatory infusion pump services for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our contracts with our next largest contracted payor  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately and of our gross billings for ambulatory infusion pump services for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also contract with various other third party payor organizations  commercial medicare replacement plans  self insured plans and numerous other insurance carriers 
no individual payor  other than those listed above  accounts for greater than approximately of our ambulatory infusion pump services gross billings 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and other direct pay customers for goods provided and services rendered 
we perform periodic analyses to assess the accounts receivable balances and record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the estimated collectability of the accounts such that the recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
upon determination that an account is uncollectible  the account is written off and charged to the allowance 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that could become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management s assessment of historical and expected net collections 
due to continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement it is possible that management s estimates could change in the near term  which could have an impact on its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
following is an analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts for infusystem holdings  inc for the years ended december in thousands balance at beginning of period acquired in acquisition charged to costs and expenses deductions balance at end of period allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts deductions represent the write off of uncollectible account receivable balances 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax expense benefit results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized 
for more information  refer to the income taxes discussion included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles valuation goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired 
we apply a fair value based impairment test for our single reporting unit to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite lived assets on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
the analysis of potential impairments of goodwill requires a 
table of contents two step process 
the first step is an estimation of fair value of the company 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
impairment exists when the fair value of goodwill or indefinite lived assets is less than the carrying value 
we performed our annual impairment analysis in october and determined that the fair value of all remaining indefinite lived assets was greater than the carrying value  resulting in no impairment of indefinite lived assets 
as of june   based on a combination of factors  including a decline in our market capitalization  updated business forecasts  and the expiration of our warrants  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment analysis 
for the purposes of the analysis performed during the second quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we concluded that an impairment loss existed and we recorded a million non cash asset impairment charge 
as of september   based on a significant decline in our market capitalization  we concluded that there was an indicator to require us to perform an additional interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment analysis 
for the purposes of the analysis performed during the third quarter of  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
we concluded that an impairment loss existed and for the three months ended september   we recorded million for non cash asset impairment charges representing our best estimate of the loss 
goodwill was fully impaired as of december  for more information  refer to the goodwill and intangible assets discussion included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
