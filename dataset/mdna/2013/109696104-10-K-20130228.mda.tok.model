definition of organic growth organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period  excluding the effect of the following items acquisitions and dispositions  changes in currency exchange rates as described on page and the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting 
business and strategy overview we have four geographic operating segments latin america  europe  middle east  and africa emea  asia pacific  and north america  which are aggregated into two reportable segments international and north america 
our north america segment includes operations in the us and canada 
we believe that brink s has significant competitive advantages including brand name recognition reputation for a high level of service and security risk management and logistics expertise global infrastructure and customer base proprietary cash processing and information systems proven operational excellence high quality insurance coverage and general financial strength we focus our time and resources on service quality  protecting and strengthening our brand  and addressing our risks 
we are a premium provider of services in most of the markets we serve 
our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the brink s brand  so we seek to protect and build its value 
because our services focus on handling  transporting  protecting  and managing valuables  we strive to understand and manage risk 
overlaying our approach is an understanding that we must be disciplined and patient enough to charge prices that reflect the value provided  the risk assumed and the need for an adequate return for our investors 
business environments around the world change constantly 
we must adapt to changes in competitive landscapes  regional economies and each customer s level of business 
we balance underlying business risk and the effects of changing demand on the utilization of our resources 
we measure financial performance on a long term basis 
the key financial measures are return on capital revenue and earnings growth cash flow generation because of our emphasis on managing risks while providing a high level of service  we focus our marketing and selling efforts on customers who appreciate the value and breadth of our services  information and risk management capabilities  and financial strength 
in order to earn an adequate return on capital  we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources as well as appropriate pricing levels 
we attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches  vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety  security or service 
due to our higher investment in people and processes  we generally charge higher prices than competitors that do not provide the same level of service and risk management 
the industries we serve have been consolidating 
as a result  the demands and expectations of customers in these industries have grown 
customers are increasingly seeking suppliers  such as brink s  with broad geographic solutions  sophisticated outsourcing capabilities and financial strength 
operating results may vary from period to period 
since revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported  they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers 
as contracts generally run for one or more years  costs are incurred to prepare to serve  or to transition away  from a customer 
we also periodically incur costs to reduce operations when volumes decline  including costs to reduce the number of employees and close or consolidate branch and administrative facilities 
in addition  security costs can vary depending on performance  cost of insurance coverage  and changes in crime rates ie  attacks and robberies 
cash management services is a fully integrated solution that proactively manages the supply chain of cash from point of sale through bank deposit 
the process includes cashier balancing and reporting  deposit processing and consolidation  and electronic information exchange including same day credit capabilities 
retail customers use brink s cash management services to count and reconcile coins and currency in a secure environment  to prepare bank deposit information  and to replenish customer coins and currency in proper denominations 
because cash management services involves a higher level of service and more complex activities  customers are charged higher prices  which result in higher margins 
the ability to offer cash management services to customers differentiates brink s from many of its competitors 
management is focused on continuing to grow cash management services revenue 
brink s revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter  because of generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season

we currently expect to continue acquiring new vehicles in the us with capital leases 
the cost of vehicles under capital lease is recognized as depreciation and interest expense

overview our effective tax rate has varied in the past three years from the statutory us federal rate due to various factors  including changes in judgment about the need for valuation allowances changes in the geographical mix of earnings nontaxable acquisition gains and losses changes in laws in the us and france timing of benefit recognition for uncertain tax positions state income taxes we establish or reverse valuation allowances for deferred tax assets depending on all available information including historical and expected future operating performance of our subsidiaries 
changes in judgment about the future realization of deferred tax assets can result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances 
based on our historical and future expected taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
outlook on a gaap basis  the effective income tax rate for is expected to be between and compared to in on a non gaap basis  the effective income tax rate for is expected to be between and compared to in our outlook for a higher effective tax rate in on a gaap basis is largely due to a forecasted nondeductible venezuela remeasurement loss 
the rate was also favorably affected by the non cash tax benefit related to a change in retiree healthcare funding strategy 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate materially from these estimates due to changes in permanent book tax differences  changes in the expected geographical mix of earnings  changes in current or deferred taxes due to legislative changes  changes in valuation allowances or accruals for contingencies and other factors

noncontrolling interests years ended december  change in millions net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in was primarily due to lower net income from our venezuelan subsidiaries

foreign operations we currently serve customers in more than countries  including approximately countries where we operate subsidiaries 
we are subject to risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries  including labor and economic conditions  political instability  controls on repatriation of earnings and capital  nationalization  expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments 
changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the future effects  if any  of these risks are unknown 
our international operations conduct a majority of their business in local currencies 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  they are affected by changes in the value of various local currencies in relation to the us dollar 
brink s venezuela is subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted and brink s argentina may in the future be subject to similar restrictions 
see application of critical accounting policies foreign currency translation on page for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our venezuelan operation in our consolidated financial statements  and a description of the accounting for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
changes in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies  as discussed in item a on page at december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was million with average contract maturities of approximately month 
the foreign currency contracts primarily offset exposures in the mexican peso and the euro 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes  and accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded immediately in earnings 
we recognized gains of million on our foreign currency contracts in at december   the fair value of these outstanding contracts was a liability of million which was included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources overview over the last three years  we have used cash generated from our continuing operations to invest in the infrastructure of our business new facilities  cash sorting and other equipment for our cash management services operations  armored trucks  compusafe units  and customer facing and back office information technology million  acquire businesses million including million in  primarily in mexico and canada  and million in france  pay dividends million  and repurchase shares of our common stock million 
we entered into a new master lease agreement in late to finance the acquisition of new armored vehicles in the us vehicles acquired under the lease agreement have been accounted for as capital leases 
vehicles acquired under the previous master lease agreement were accounted for as operating leases 
outlook we continue to consider acquisition opportunities in the secure transportation and cash management services industry and in adjacent security markets 
we may use our cash from operations and borrowings to fund the purchase of these acquisitions 
we expect our capital expenditures in to approximate the amounts spent in as we continue to reduce maintenance capital spending through efficiency projects and reallocate more of our spending to growth and productivity initiatives 
we will be required to make contributions of million to our primary us pension plan in based on current assumptions  we expect to make additional contributions totalling million during the next nine years 
we may choose to contribute company stock for future required contributions 
operating activities years ended december  change in millions cash flows from operating activities non gaap basis decrease increase in certain customer obligations a discontinued operations b gaap basis a to eliminate the change in the balance of customer obligations related to cash received and processed in certain of our secure cash management services operations 
the title to this cash transfers to us for a short period of time 
the cash is generally credited to customers accounts the following day and we do not consider it as available for general corporate purposes in the management of our liquidity and capital resources 
b to eliminate cash flows related to our discontinued operations 
non gaap cash flows from operating activities are supplemental financial measures that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
the purpose of the non gaap cash flows from operating activities is to report financial information excluding the impact of cash received and processed in certain of our secure cash management services operations  without cash flows from discontinued operations 
we believe these measures are helpful in assessing cash flows from operations  enable period to period comparability and are useful in predicting future operating cash flows 
non gaap cash flows from operating activities should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows 
versus gaap operating cash flows increased by million in compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash held for customers in certain of our secure cash management services operations and million in proceeds from the sale of value added tax receivables in venezuela 
these increases were offset by a million cash contribution to our us pension plan  the payment of million in pension benefits to our former ceo  a customer loss that was paid in with the related million insurance recovery expected to be received in early  and a million increase in income tax payments 
non gaap cash flows from operating activities decreased from by million 
this decrease was primarily due to a million cash contribution to our us pension plan  the payment of million in pension benefits to our former ceo  a customer loss that was paid in with the related million insurance recovery expected to be received in early  and a million increase in income tax payments 
these decreases were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of value added tax receivables in venezuela 
versus gaap operating cash flows increased by million in compared to as a result of an million decrease in cash used by discontinued operations and a million increase in cash flows from continuing operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations improved because the prior year period included million in cash outflow for a legal claim associated with bax global  a former business unit 
cash from continuing operations increased million due to higher operating profit and an increase in cash flows from working capital  partially offset by a million decrease in cash flows due to the change in customer obligations for cash held by secure cash management services operations and an increase in income tax and interest payments 
the amount of cash generated by operating profit was higher than the increase in operating profit primarily because noncash depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in compared to driven by fixed assets acquired in and the mexican acquisition in november non gaap cash flows from operating activities increased by million 
the increase in cash flows was primarily due to higher operating profit and an increase in cash flows from working capital  partially offset by an increase in income tax and interest payments 
the amount of cash generated by operating profit was higher than the increase in operating profit primarily because noncash depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in compared to driven by new fixed asset acquisitions in the second half of and the mexican acquisition in november brink s former president and ceo was paid million in as provided for under a succession agreement and million in for a pension benefit 
brink s also remitted million of taxes in on a distribution of his deferred compensation 
the million is included in cash flows from operating activities and the million is included in cash flows from financing activities 
the payment of pension benefits was funded by the sale of assets in an existing grantor trust  the proceeds of which are reported in investing activities 
investing activities years ended december  change in millions cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures acquisitions proceeds from the sale of assets other discontinued operations investing activities cash used by investing activities decreased by million in versus primarily due to million less in capital expenditures in the current year and cash received from the redemption of cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
these items were offset by a million increase in cash used for business acquisitions as we acquired a logistics software provider in france in cash flows from investing activities improved by million in versus primarily due to million of cash used in to purchase new businesses  primarily operations in mexico and canada  offset by higher capital expenditures in  as described below 
in addition  we had higher proceeds from the sale of investments and other property in capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization were as follows outlook years ended december  change in millions property and equipment acquired during the year capital expenditures international a north america a capital expenditures capital leases b international a north america a capital leases total international a north america a total depreciation and amortization international a north america a depreciation and amortization a not provided 
b represents the amount of property and equipment acquired using capital leases 
since the assets are acquired without using cash  the acquisitions are not reflected in the consolidated cash flow statement 
amounts are provided here to assist in the comparison of assets acquired in the current year versus prior years 
sale leaseback transactions are excluded from capital leases in this table 
capital expenditures in were primarily for new cash processing and security equipment  armored vehicles and information technology 
capital expenditures in were slightly lower when compared to  however total property and equipment acquired in was million lower than the prior year 
total property and equipment acquired during is expected to be about flat with capital expenditures in were primarily for information technology  armored vehicles and new cash processing and security equipment 
capital expenditures in increased when compared to primarily due to an increase in our international segment 
the increase in our international segment is largely due to capital expenditures in mexico 
financing activities summary of financing activities years ended december  in millions cash provided used by financing activities borrowings and repayments short term debt long term revolving credit facilities issuance of private placement notes other long term debt borrowings repayments debt financing costs repurchase shares of common stock of brink cash proceeds from sale leaseback transactions dividends attributable to shareholders of brink s noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries acquisition of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries other discontinued operations cash flows from financing activities debt borrowings and repayments in and  we repaid a portion of our debt as cash flows from operating activities exceeded the net cash used by our investing activities 
the net borrowings in were used to fund business acquisitions and the repurchase of common stock 
share purchases in  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
common stock we contributed million in newly issued common stock to our primary us pension plan in because the contribution did not involve cash  the transaction is not included in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
dividends we paid dividends to brink s shareholders of per share in each of the last quarters 
future dividends are dependent on our earnings  financial condition  shareholders equity levels  our cash flow and business requirements  as determined by the board of directors 
capitalization we use a combination of debt  leases and equity to capitalize our operations 
tight credit markets in late and early resulted in unreliable credit availability under our us armored vehicle master lease agreement and volatile pricing 
as a result  from march to late  we purchased vehicles with cash borrowed under our committed credit facilities instead of leasing 
in late as credit markets stabilized  we began to lease vehicles under a new master agreement 
vehicles acquired under the master lease agreement are accounted for as capital leases 
vehicles acquired under the previous lease agreement are accounted for as operating leases based on terms of that agreement 
we expect to continue financing new vehicles in the us using capital leases 
as of december   debt as a percentage of capitalization defined as total debt and equity was compared to at december  the decrease resulted mainly from a higher equity balance compared to the end of equity increased primarily as a result of an increase in retained earnings as net income exceeded dividends paid to brink s shareholders during summary of debt  equity and other liquidity information amount available under credit facilities outstanding balance december  december  in millions change a debt revolving facility private placement notes capital leases dominion terminal associates bonds multi currency revolving facilities credit facility letter of credit facilities other debt total equity a in addition to cash borrowings and repayments  the change in the debt balance also includes changes in currency exchange rates 
reconciliation of net debt to gaap measures december  in millions change debt short term debt long term debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents amounts held by cash management services operations a cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate purposes net debt a title to cash received and processed in certain of our secure cash management services operations transfers to us for a short period of time 
the cash is generally credited to customers accounts the following day and we do not consider it as available for general corporate purposes in the management of our liquidity and capital resources and in our computation of net debt 
net debt is a supplemental non gaap financial measure that is not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
we use net debt as a measure of our financial leverage 
we believe that investors also may find net debt to be helpful in evaluating our financial leverage 
net debt should not be considered as an alternative to debt determined in accordance with gaap and should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
set forth above is a reconciliation of net debt  a non gaap financial measure  to debt  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap  as of december   and december  net debt excluding cash and debt in venezuelan operations was million at december   and million at december  net debt at the end of was equal to net debt at the end of as cash provided by operating activities was offset by cash used by investing activities  dividends paid to brink s shareholders and noncontrolling interests  and cash paid for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 
liquidity needs our operating liquidity needs are typically financed by cash from operations  short term debt and the revolving facility our debt facilities are described below 
we have certain limitations and considerations related to the cash and borrowing capacity that are reported in our consolidated financial statements 
based on our current cash on hand  amounts available under our credit facilities and current projections of cash flows from operations  we believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months 
limitations on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
a significant portion of our operations are outside the us which may make it difficult to repatriate cash for use in the us see item a  risk factors  for more information on the risks associated with having businesses outside the us incremental taxes 
of the million of cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately million is held by subsidiaries that we consider to be permanently invested and for which we do not expect to repatriate to the us if we decided to repatriate this cash to the us  we may have to accrue and pay additional income taxes 
given the number of foreign operations and the complexities of the tax law  it is not practical to estimate the potential tax liability  but the amount of taxes owed could be material depending on how and when the repatriation occurred 
venezuela 
the venezuelan government has currency restrictions that limit our ability to obtain us dollars to operate our business and to repatriate cash 
this may limit our ability to use funds earned in venezuela for general corporate purposes  including reducing our debt 
at december   our venezuelan subsidiaries held million of cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars and million of cash denominated in bolivar fuertes 
pension contributions 
we have a significant underfunded us pension plan that will be required to be funded in the future 
we currently expect to be able to fund pension contributions in the future with cash from operations and borrowings  but we may contribute shares of our stock in the future  if necessary 
the contributions to our primary us pension plan total million based on current assumptions 
debt we have a million unsecured revolving bank credit facility the revolving facility that matures in january the revolving facility s interest rate is based on libor plus a margin  alternate base rate plus a margin  or competitive bid 
the revolving facility allows us to borrow or issue letters of credit or otherwise satisfy credit needs on a revolving basis over the term of the facility 
as of december   million was available under the revolving facility 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of december  were denominated primarily in us dollars and to a lesser extent in canadian dollars and in euros 
the margin on libor borrowings under the revolving facility  which can range from to depending on our credit rating  was at december  the margin on alternate base rate borrowings under the revolving facility can range from to 
we also pay an annual facility fee on the revolving facility based on our credit rating 
the facility fee can range from to and was at december  we have million in unsecured notes through a private placement debt transaction the notes 
the notes comprise million in series a notes with a fixed interest rate of and million in series b notes with a fixed interest rate of 
the notes are due in january with principal payments under the series a notes to begin in january we have three unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities with a total of million in available credit  of which approximately million was available at december  a million facility expires in may  a million facility expires in october  and a million facility expires in december interest on these facilities is based on libor plus a margin 
the margin ranges from to 
we also have the ability to borrow from other banks  at the banks discretion  under short term uncommitted agreements 
various foreign subsidiaries maintain other lines of credit and overdraft facilities with a number of banks 
we have a million unsecured committed credit facility that expires in april interest on this facility is based on libor plus a margin  which ranges from to 
as of december   million was available under the facility 
we have three unsecured letter of credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was available at december  a million facility and a million facility expire in december and an million facility expires in june the revolving facility and the multi currency revolving credit facilities are also used for issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
the revolving facility  the notes  the unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities  the unsecured committed credit facility and the letter of credit facilities contain subsidiary guarantees and various financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants  among other things  limit our total indebtedness  limit priority debt  limit asset sales  limit the use of proceeds from asset sales and provide for minimum coverage of interest costs 
the credit agreements do not provide for the acceleration of payments should our credit rating be reduced 
if we were not to comply with the terms of our various credit agreements  the repayment terms could be accelerated and the commitments could be withdrawn 
an acceleration of the repayment terms under one agreement could trigger the acceleration of the repayment terms under the other loan agreements 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  we have million of bonds issued by the peninsula ports authority of virginia recorded as debt on our balance sheet 
although we are not the primary obligor of the debt  we have guaranteed the debt and we believe that we will ultimately pay this obligation 
the guarantee originated as part of a former interest in dominion terminal associates  a deep water coal terminal 
we continue to pay interest on the debt 
the bonds bear a fixed interest rate of and mature in the bonds may mature prior to upon the occurrence of specified events such as the determination that the bonds are taxable or if we fail to abide by the terms of the guarantee 
equity common stock at december   we had million shares of common stock authorized and million shares issued and outstanding 
on february   we filed a shelf registration statement under form s asr with the sec for million of our common stock 
under this shelf registration  we are able to issue up to million of new common stock 
on march   we issued  shares of our common stock and contributed the shares to our primary us pension plan 
sales of these shares by the pension plan are covered under our shelf registration statement 
the common stock was valued for purposes of the contribution at per share  or million in the aggregate  which reflected a discount from the per share closing share price of our common stock on march  preferred stock at december   we had the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note for operating leases that have residual value guarantees or other terms that cause the agreement to be considered a variable interest 
we use operating leases to lower our cost of financings 
we believe that operating leases are an important component of our capital structure

based on current assumptions  including the provisions of this legislation  we expect to make contributions totaling million from to umwa plans retirement benefits related to former coal operations include medical benefits provided by the pittston coal group companies employee benefit plan for umwa represented employees 
there are approximately  beneficiaries in the umwa plans 
the company does not expect to make additional contributions to these plans until based on actuarial assumptions 
black lung under the federal black lung benefits act of  brink s is responsible for paying lifetime black lung benefits to miners and their dependents for claims filed and approved after june  there are approximately black lung beneficiaries 
other we have a plan that provides retirement healthcare benefits to certain eligible salaried employees 
benefits under this plan are not indexed for inflation 
assumptions for us retirement obligations we have made various assumptions to estimate the amount of payments to be made in the future 
the most significant assumptions include changing discount rates and other assumptions in effect at measurement dates normally december investment returns of plan assets addition of new participants historically immaterial due to freezing of pension benefits and exit from coal business mortality rates change in laws the contractual obligations table above represents payments projected to be paid with our corporate funds and does not represent payments projected to be made to beneficiaries with retirement plan assets

discounted cash flows at plan discount rates reconciled to liability amounts reported under us gaap december  in millions primary us pension plan b umwa plans c other unfunded us plans total funded status of us retirement plans gaap present value of projected earnings of plan assets a discounted cash flows at plan discount rates non gaap plan discount rate expected return of assets a under gaap  the funded status of a benefit plan is reduced by the fair market value of plan assets at the balance sheet date  and the present value of the projected earnings on plan assets does not reduce the funded status at the balance sheet date 
the non gaap measure presented above additionally reduces the funded status as computed under gaap by the present value of projected earnings of plan assets using the expected return on asset assumptions of the respective plan 
b for the primary us pension plan  we are required by erisa regulations to maintain minimum funding levels  and as a result  we estimate we will be required to make minimum required contributions from to we have estimated that we will achieve the required funded ratio after the contribution 
c there are no minimum funding requirements for the umwa plans because they are not covered by erisa funding regulations 
using assumptions at the end of  we project that the plan assets plus expected earnings on those investments will cover the benefit payments for these plans until we project that brink s will be required to contribute cash to the plan beginning in to pay beneficiaries 
discounted cash flows at plan discount rates are supplemental financial measures that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
the purpose of the discounted cash flows at plan discount rate is to present our retirement obligations after giving effect to the benefit of earning a return on plan assets 
we believe this measure is helpful in assessing the present value of future funding requirements of the company in order to meet plan benefit obligations 
discounted cash flows at plan discount rates should not be considered as an alternative to the funded status of the us retirement plans at december   as determined in accordance with gaap and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
contingent matters other we are involved in various other lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
we are not able to estimate the range of losses for some of these matters 
we have recorded accruals for losses that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the application of accounting principles requires the use of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
we make assumptions  estimates and judgments based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes  similarly situated businesses and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with relevant knowledge and experience 
reported results could have been materially different had we used a different set of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets result primarily from net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
accounting policies we establish valuation allowances in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  when we estimate it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
we decide to record valuation allowances primarily based on an assessment of historical earnings and future taxable income that incorporates prudent  feasible tax planning strategies 
we assess deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
changes in tax statutes  the timing of deductibility of expenses or expectations for future performance could result in material adjustments to our valuation allowances  which would increase or decrease tax expense 
our valuation allowances are as follows 
valuation allowances december  in millions us non us total application of accounting policies us deferred tax assets we have million of net deferred tax assets at december   and million related to us jurisdictions 
there were no significant changes to our us valuation allowances in we used various estimates and assumptions to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in the us these included projected revenues and operating income for our us entities  estimated required contributions to our us retirement plans  and interest rates on projected us borrowings 
for our projections of future us taxable earnings  we assumed that our us operation s margins improve to in the near term 
had we used different assumptions  we might have made different conclusions about the need for valuation allowances 
for example  using different assumptions in and we might have concluded that we require a valuation allowance offsetting our us deferred tax assets at the end of and non us deferred tax assets we changed our judgment about the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in certain non us jurisdictions as a result of improvements in operating results and an improved outlook about the future operating performance in those jurisdictions 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowances in and million of valuation allowances in through continuing operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment valuations accounting policies at december   we had property and equipment of million  goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we review these assets for possible impairment using the guidance in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  for goodwill and other intangible assets and fasb asc topic  property  plant and equipment  for property and equipment 
our review for impairment requires the use of significant judgments about the future performance of our operating subsidiaries 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimates of the fair value of these assets  differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the impairment analyses 
application of accounting policies goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
under us gaap  the annual impairment test may be either a quantitative test or a qualitative assessment 
the qualitative assessment can be performed in order to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that reporting unit fair values are greater than their carrying values 
for  we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test 
we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using projections of cash flows and compared to its carrying value 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment test as of october   and concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
finite lived intangible assets and property and equipment we review finite lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether impairment has occurred  we compare estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows we made significant assumptions when preparing financial projections of free cash flow used in our impairment analyses  including assumptions of future results of operations  capital requirements  income taxes  long term growth rates for determining terminal value  and discount rates 
our results may have been different if we had used different assumptions 
retirement and postemployment benefit obligations we provide benefits through defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical benefit plans and under statutory requirements 
accounting policy we account for pension and other retirement benefit obligations under fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
we account for postemployment benefit obligations  including workers compensation obligations  under fasb asc topic  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
to account for these benefits  we make assumptions of expected return on assets  discount rates  inflation  demographic factors and changes in the laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of these items and because the obligations are significant  changes in the assumptions could have a material effect on our liabilities and expenses related to these benefits 
our most significant retirement plans include our primary us pension plan and the retiree medical plans of our former coal business that were collectively bargained with the united mine workers of america the umwa 
the critical accounting estimates that determine the carrying values of liabilities and the resulting annual expense are discussed below 
application of accounting policy discount rate assumptions for plans accounted under fasb asc topic  we discount estimated future payments using discount rates based on market conditions at the end of the year 
in general  our liability changes in an inverse relationship to interest rates 
that is  the lower the discount rate  the higher the associated plan obligation 
us plans for our largest retirement plans  including the primary us pension and umwa plans and black lung obligations  we derive the discount rates used to measure the present value of benefit obligations using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  we compare the plan s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on a mercer yield curve 
each year s projected cash flows are then discounted back to their present value at the measurement date and an overall discount rate is determined 
the overall discount rate is then rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
as of december   we used mercer s above mean curve to determine the discount rates for the year end benefit obligation 
we used the regular mercer yield curve in to determine the discount rates for the benefit obligation 
to derive the regular mercer yield curve  mercer uses a hypothetical portfolio of high quality aa rated corporate bonds 
to derive the above mean curve  mercer uses only those bonds with a yield higher than the mean yield of the same portfolio of high quality bonds 
the above mean curve  made available by mercer in  represents a more focused market based approach  which reflects the way an active investment manager would select high quality bonds to match the cash flows of the plan 
discount rates are approximately basis points higher using the above mean curve as compared to the regular mercer yield curve 
our primary us pension and umwa plans and black lung obligations would have been million higher had we used the regular mercer yield curve at december  non us plans we use the same cash flow matching method to derive the discount rates of our major non us retirement plans 
where the cash flow matching method is not possible  rates of local high quality long term corporate bonds are used to estimate the discount rate 
the discount rates for the primary us pension plan  umwa retiree medical plans and black lung obligations were primary us plan umwa plans black lung discount rate retirement cost benefit obligation at year end sensitivity analysis the discount rate we select at year end affects the valuations of plan obligations at year end and calculations of net periodic expenses for the following year 
the tables below compare hypothetical plan obligation valuations for our largest plans as of december   actual expenses for and projected expenses for assuming we had used discount rates that were one percentage point lower or higher

we select the expected return on assets assumption using advice from our investment advisor and actuary considering each plan s asset allocation targets and expected overall investment manager performance and a review of the most recent long term historical average compounded rates of return  as applicable 
we selected as the expected return on assets assumption for our primary us plan and for our umwa retiree medical plans as of december  we selected as the expected return on assets assumption for our primary us plan and for our umwa retiree medical plans as of december  over the last ten years  the annual returns of our primary us pension plan have averaged  on a compounded basis   net of fees  while the year and year compounded annual return averaged  and the year compounded annual return averaged 
sensitivity analysis effect of using different expected rate of return assumptions 
our and projected expense would have been different if we had used different expected rate of return assumptions 
for every hypothetical change of one percentage point in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and holding other assumptions constant  our and expense would be as follows hypothetical sensitivity analysis hypothetical sensitivity analysis for expected return on asset for expected return on asset in millions  except percentages assumption assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  expected return on asset assumption primary us pension plan umwa plans primary us pension plan umwa plans effect of improving or deteriorating actual future market returns

effect of using fair market value of assets to determine expense 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
in addition  our plan asset actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization are based on the market related value 
the market related value of the plan assets is different from the actual or fair market value of the assets 
the actual or fair market value is  at a point in time  the value of the assets that is available to make payments to pensioners and to cover any transaction costs 
the market related value recognizes changes in fair value from the expected value on a straight line basis over five years 
this recognition method spreads the effects of year over year volatility in the financial markets over several years 
our expenses related to our primary us pension plan would have been different if our accounting policy were to use the fair market value of plan assets instead of the market related value to recognize investment gains and losses 
in millions based on market related value of assets hypothetical a actual projected projected years ending december  expense income primary us pension plan a assumes that our accounting policy was to use the fair market value of assets instead of the market related value of assets to determine our expense related to our primary us pension plan 
for our umwa plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the fair market value of the assets at the beginning of the year 
this method is likely to cause the expected return on assets  which is recorded in earnings  to fluctuate more than had we used the accounting methodology of our defined benefit pension plans 
medical inflation assumption we estimate the trend in healthcare cost inflation to predict future cash flows related to our retiree medical plans 
our assumption is based on recent plan experience and industry trends 
for the umwa plans  our largest postretirement plans  we have assumed a medical inflation rate of for  and we project this rate to decline to by the average annual medical inflation rate of the company over the last three years was 
if we had assumed that medical inflation rates were one percentage point higher in each future year  the plan obligation for these plans at december   would have been approximately million higher and the expense for would have been million higher 
if we had assumed that the medical inflation rates were one percentage point lower  the plan obligation at december   would have been approximately million lower and the related expenses would have been million lower 
if we had projected medical inflation rates to decline from to by  instead of our projected decline to by  the plan obligation for the umwa retiree medical benefit plan would have been million higher for and our expense would be million higher for in addition  the patient protection and affordable care act could substantially change the healthcare and insurance industries in the us  which could increase our costs 
excise tax on administrators by patient protection and affordable care act a excise tax will be imposed on high cost health plans cadillac plans beginning in the tax will apply to plan costs that exceed a certain threshold level for individuals and for families  which will be indexed to inflation 
there will be higher limits for high risk professions  among which is mining 
even though the tax is not assessed directly to an employer but rather to the benefits plan administrator  the cost is expected to be passed through to plan sponsors as higher premiums or higher claims administration fees  increasing the plan sponsor s obligations 
we project that we will have to pay the benefits plan administrator this excise tax beginning in  and our plan obligations at december  include million related to this tax 
we are currently unable to reduce the benefit levels of our umwa medical plans to avoid this excise tax because these benefit levels are required by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of workers compensation besides the effects of changes in medical costs  worker s compensation costs are affected by the severity and types of injuries  changes in state and federal regulations and their application and the quality of programs which assist an employee s return to work 
our liability for future payments for workers compensation claims is evaluated annually with the assistance of an actuary 
numbers of participants the valuations of all of these benefit plans are affected by the life expectancy of the participants 
accordingly  we rely on actuarial information to predict the number and life expectancy of participants 
we use the following mortality table for our major plans 
plan mortality table umwa plans rp separate pre and post retirement  healthy blue collar black lung rp combined annuitant non annuitant blue collar primary us pension rp combined healthy blue collar the number of participants by major plan in the past five years is as follows number of participants plan umwa plans black lung us pension since we are no longer operating in the coal industry  we anticipate that the number of participants in the umwa retirement medical plan will decline over time due to mortality 
since the us pension plan has been frozen  the number of its participants will also decline over time 
foreign currency translation the majority of our subsidiaries outside the us conduct business in their local currencies 
our financials report results in us dollars  which include the results of these subsidiaries 
accounting policy our accounting policy for foreign currency translation is different depending on whether the economy in which our foreign subsidiary operates has been designated as highly inflationary 
economies with a three year cumulative inflation rate of more than are considered highly inflationary 
subsequent reductions in cumulative inflation rates below do not change the method of translation unless the reduction is deemed to be other than temporary 
effective january   we began accounting for our venezuelan subsidiaries as operating in a highly inflationary economy 
non highly inflationary economies assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in non highly inflationary economies are translated into us dollars using rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
revenues and expenses are translated at rates of exchange in effect during the year 
transaction gains and losses are recorded in net income 
highly inflationary economies foreign subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary countries must use the reporting currency the us dollar as the functional currency 
local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into dollars each balance sheet date  with remeasurement adjustments and other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 
non monetary assets and liabilities do not fluctuate with changes in local currency exchange rates to the dollar 
application of accounting policy venezuela our venezuelan operations constitute a material portion of our overall consolidated operations  and accounted for million or of total brink s revenues in we consolidate our venezuelan results using our accounting policy for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
since  the venezuelan government has controlled the exchange of local currency into other currencies  including the us dollar 
from to the present the government has maintained an official exchange rate 
the rate is available only for transactions that have been approved by the government s currency control agency  known as cadivi 
in addition to the official rate  a parallel market exchange rate was available until a june law disallowed the use of the parallel rate 
prior to june  the parallel rate could be used to convert local cash into dollars 
the average parallel bolivar fuerte to dollar rate was in the first five months of in june  the venezuelan government established a supplemental expedited official exchange process which required that each transaction be approved by the government s central bank the sitme process 
the majority of sitme transactions were approved at a rate of bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
in february  the government eliminated the sitme exchange process 
in february  the government also devalued cadivi s official rate to from bolivar fuertes to the dollar 
we remeasured bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets using the parallel rate until june  when the venezuelan government disallowed parallel market exchanges and established the sitme process 
through december   we used the sitme rate of bolivar fuertes to the dollar to remeasure our bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets and liabilities into us dollars 
at december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets of million 
we did not recognize any remeasurement gains or losses in or as the exchange rate did not change 
beginning in february  we intend to use the cadivi official exchange rate of to remeasure our bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
as a result of the devaluation  we estimate that we will incur a pretax remeasurement loss of approximately million to million in the first quarter of in addition  our revenues and earnings in venezuela in will be negatively affected because of the devaluation 
for example  had this devaluation occurred at the beginning of  reported revenues for would have been reduced by million and net income attributable to brink s would have been reduced by million 
we have had very limited success with the cadivi exchange process since it began in we are currently unsure whether we will be able to continue to obtain sufficient us dollars to purchase imported supplies and fixed assets to operate our business in venezuela  and as a result  we may experience business interruptions and higher operating costs 
at december   our venezuelan subsidiaries held million of cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars and million of cash denominated in bolivar fuertes 
on an equity method basis  we had investments in our venezuelan operations of million at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently serve customers in more than countries  including approximately countries where we operate subsidiaries 
these operations expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial and commodity exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
we periodically use various derivative and non derivative financial instruments  as discussed below  to hedge our interest rate  commodity prices and foreign currency exposures when appropriate 
the risk that counterparties to these instruments may be unable to perform is minimized by limiting the counterparties used to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
we do not expect to incur a loss from the failure of any counterparty to perform under the agreements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging underlying financial or commercial exposures 
the sensitivity analyses discussed below for the market risk exposures were based on the facts and circumstances in effect at december  actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under management s control and could vary materially from those disclosed 
interest rate risk we use both fixed and floating rate debt and leases to finance our operations 
floating rate obligations  including our revolving facility  expose us to fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
fixed rate obligations  including our dominion terminal associates debt and our unsecured notes  are subject to fluctuations in fair values as a result of changes in interest rates 
based on the contractual interest rates on the floating rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in rates would increase cash outflows by approximately million over a twelve month period 
in other words  our weighted average interest rate on our floating rate instruments was per annum at december  if that average rate were to increase by percentage points to  the cash outflows associated with these instruments would increase by million annually 
the effect on the fair values on our dominion terminal associates dta debt and on our unsecured notes for a hypothetical decrease in the yield curve from year end levels would result in a million increase for our dta debt and a million increase for our unsecured notes in the fair values of the debt 
foreign currency risk we have exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of all of our foreign operations 
our foreign operations generally use local currencies to conduct business but their results are reported in us dollars 
we are also exposed periodically to the foreign currency rate fluctuations that affect transactions not denominated in the functional currency of domestic and foreign operations 
to mitigate these exposures  we  from time to time  enter into foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
at december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was million with average contract maturities of approximately one month 
the foreign currency contracts primarily offset exposures in the mexican peso and the euro 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries since such investments are long term in nature 
the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous appreciation in the us dollar from year end levels against all other currencies of countries in which we have continuing operations are as follows hypothetical effects in millions increase decrease effect on earnings translation of earnings into us dollars transaction gains losses effect on other comprehensive income loss translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries the hypothetical foreign currency effects above detail the consolidated effect attributable to brink s of a simultaneous change in the value of a large number of foreign currencies relative to the u 
s 
dollar 
the foreign currency exposure effect related to a change in an individual currency could be significantly different 
venezuela our business in venezuela represents approximately of our consolidated revenues 
currently  venezuela operates in a highly inflationary economy and its currency is fixed to the us dollar 
the investment in our venezuelan subsidiaries  and cash and other net monetary assets held by these subsidiaries are as follows december  in millions equity method investment in venezuelan subsidiaries a net monetary assets held by our venezuelan subsidiaries cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes cash accounts receivable  accounts payable and other  net total a the amount represents retained earnings net of currency translation adjustments of the business 
in february  the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate resulting in a new official rate of bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
as a result of this devaluation  we estimate that we will incur a pretax remeasurement loss of approximately million to million in the first quarter of in addition  our revenues and earnings in venezuela in will be negatively affected because of the devaluation 
for example  had this devaluation occurred at the beginning of  reported revenues for would have been reduced by million and net income attributable to brink s would have been reduced by million
