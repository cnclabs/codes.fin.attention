liquidity and capital resources 
at june   we had a cash balance of million  compared to million at june  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed a private placement of million in convertible notes the notes  for net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes are scheduled to mature in february and bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semi annually 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
at june   we had a balance of million recorded as long term debt 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  in a private placement transaction  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of approximately million 
in august  we entered into a credit facility that provides for an million secured revolving loan and may be used to fund our working capital and our general business requirements 
at june   we had a balance of million recorded as long term debt  and a remaining external borrowing capacity of million 
cash management and preservation continue to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during fiscal as we continue to reshape our business model and further improve operational efficiencies 
management has projected that cash on hand  combined with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations for the next months 
significant changes from our current forecasts  including but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes in the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
this could force us to make further reductions in spending  extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible and or suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we may seek debt  equity or equity based financing such as convertible debt when market conditions permit 
as of june   we had working capital of million  reflecting decreases in current assets and current liabilities of million and million  respectively  during fiscal the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to i a million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales volumes primarily in our tape based and disk based products sold in the americas region  and disk based products sold in europe  the middle east and africa emea  ii a million decrease in other current assets primarily due to a decrease in deferred costs for service contracts  iii a million decrease in cash  and iv a million decrease in inventory 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to i a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to operating activities  ii a million decrease in our stock appreciation rights valuation liability  and iii a million decrease in accrued warranty obligations 

table of contents recent developments in july  we entered into a supply agreement  and a technology license agreement  with sphere d corporation sphere d

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 

table of contents generally  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
for products in which software is more than an incidental component  we recognize revenue in accordance with current authoritative guidance for software revenue recognition 
share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including  among others  expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
warranty obligations we provide for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with current accounting rules 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
any such unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
similarly  if we experience a decrease in warranty claims or our costs to provide services decline  we may be required to decrease our warranty accrual  which may have a favorable impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
warrants we have warrants to purchase common stock that are issued and outstanding and have been classified as equity in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the terms of these warrants  in particular their anti dilution provisions  are evaluated on an on going basis to determine whether equity classification remains appropriate 
if these warrants were classified as a liability obligation  then the warrants would be adjusted to fair value at each reporting period with the fair market value adjustments being recorded to earnings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and essentially all of our products sold in international markets are denominated in us dollars 
historically  export sales have represented a significant portion of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france and germany incur costs that are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results may vary from expectations when translated into us dollars  which could adversely impact overall expected results 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations resulted in a loss of  for fiscal and a gain of  for fiscal
