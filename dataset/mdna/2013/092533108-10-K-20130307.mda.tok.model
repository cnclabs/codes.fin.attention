table of contents dividends our quarterly dividends  if any  are determined by our board of directors 
dividends are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to stockholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level 
dividends declared by the company since july  inception of operations have been as follows dividend amount per share outstanding record date payment date december  january  march  march  june  june  september  september  december  january  march  march  may  may  september  september  december  december  march  march  june  june  september  september  december  december  march  april  june  july  september  october  december  january  march  april  may  july  september  october  december  january  march  april  june  july  september  october  december  january  march  april  june  july  september  october  december  january  march  april  tax characteristics of all dividends are reported to stockholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
in order to maintain favorable ric tax treatment  we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
under the regulated investment company modernization act of  capital losses incurred by the company after december  will not be subject to expiration 
in addition  such losses must be utilized prior to the losses incurred in the years preceding enactment 
in order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october st  and 
table of contents any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
we may  at our discretion  carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a excise tax on this income 
if we choose to do so  all other things being equal  this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our stockholders 
we accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
there was no provision for federal excise taxes recorded for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  we recorded a provision for federal excise taxes of  there was no undistributed taxable income carried forward from we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
with respect to our dividends and distributions paid to stockholders during the years ended december   and  dividends reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan totaled   and  respectively 
under the terms of an amendment to our dividend reinvestment plan adopted on march   dividends may be paid in newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock at a price equal to of the market price on the dividend payment date 
this feature of the plan means that  under certain circumstances  we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
also  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc under the act and due to provisions in our existing and future debt arrangements 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of favorable ric tax treatment 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as pik interest or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a ric and may be subject to an excise tax 
in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to rics  we have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash 
as long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash which portion can be as low as for our taxable years ending prior to and certain requirements are met  the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for us federal income tax purposes 
with respect to dividends paid to stockholders  certain income we receive from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies may cause our taxable income to exceed our gaap income although the differences are expected to be temporary in nature
