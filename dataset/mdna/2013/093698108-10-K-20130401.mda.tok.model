part i item business introduction overview blonder tongue is a technology development and manufacturing company that delivers television signal encoding  transcoding  digital transport and broadband product solutions for a broad range of applications 
the markets we serve include cable television systems  multi dwelling units  the lodging hospitality market and institutional systems  including hospitals  prisons and schools 
from the cable television pioneers that founded the company in  to the highly experienced research and development team that creates new products today  the company s success stems from listening to the needs of its customers  providing quality products to meet those needs and supporting those products after delivery 
for over years blonder tongue has been providing innovative solutions based on continually advancing technology  enabling the company to maintain its position as a leader in many of the markets it serves 
since its founding blonder tongue has continued to keep abreast of evolving technologies  from analog to digital television  into high definition hd digital encoding  internet protocol television iptv processing and distribution  as well as edge qam quadrature amplitude modulation products 
by broadening these product groups  the company is positioned to grow its existing business and continue to expand the applications and markets it serves 
the cable television market has reacted quickly to consumer demands for additional services by integrating multiple technologies into existing networks  providing consumers with high speed internet access in addition to enhanced video offerings 
today  video offerings have expanded from traditional cable television service to internet protocol ip based video delivery  switched digital video  video on demand  scheduled playback and video storage 
telephone companies have increased their market share in this competitive environment with fiber to the home distribution networks  enabling them to provide traditional cable television  expanded video services and high speed internet services  in addition to telephony offerings 
lodging and institutional markets  as well as the mdu market  continue to upgrade their networks to carry hd channels in order to meet consumers expectations 
this is a significant area of opportunity for the company to market and sell its expanded digital product line 
the market segments that the company serves have been focused on digital technologies  not only in broadcast  but throughout video and broadband transport 
the company has identified three significant opportunities in the digital space encoding  iptv and edgeqam 
encoding enables operators to provide standard definition sd or hd content delivery transported over a broadband network 
iptv enables operators to stream video over private data networks with greater reliability and content security 
while already experiencing full scale commercialization in international markets  the united states market continues to increasingly embrace iptv technology 
the worldwide market now has over million iptv subscribers  and is projected to have million by service providers transport both sd and hd video content in mpeg formats over ip networks to network edge devices located in high density serving areas 
the device at the edge of the transport system ie close to the customer location  is commonly referred to as edgeqam  because it allows the conversion from ip to radio frequency rf via qam modulation 
these signals are then transported to the customer across a hybrid fiber coax hfc network 
management of the company estimates the market for edgeqam devices to be about million over the next three years 
in the company began marketing and selling iptv products  in shipped its first high quality hd encoder  in began shipping its high quality affordably priced edgeqam product and in began shipping its h 
hd encoder 
the company continues to develop new versions of these products to expand their use in additional markets and applications 
recent developments the company has continued to advance the implementation of its strategic plan in an effort to maximize shareholder value 
the company s strategic plan consists of the following strengthen core business  continue the heritage of technology development  expand into new markets  including penetration into the multi system operator and broadcast television markets  and increase gross margins 
since  the company has entered into and renewed several agreements through which it has acquired rights to use and incorporate certain proprietary technologies in its digital encoder line of products  including implementation and system license agreement with dolby laboratories licensing corporation dolby labs for dolby digital plus professional encoder  and channel licensed technology 
license agreement with digital transmission licensing administrator  llc dtla to become a full adopter of digital transmission content protection dtcp license technology 
license agreement with lg electronics as a pro idiom content protection system manufacturer 
ownership from the motion picture experts group of an mpeg profile high level video encoder ip core 
the dolby labs license agreement grants the company the right to manufacture  label and sell professional digital encoder products and consumer digital decoder products and to use the dolby trademarks 
this technology has a number of improvements aimed at increasing quality at a given bit rate compared with legacy dolby digital ac 
most notably  it offers increased bit rates  support for more audio channels  improved coding techniques to reduce compression artifacts  and backward compatibility with existing ac hardware 
the dtla and lg electronics license agreements provide the company with certain technology necessary for production of edgeqam devices for the hospitality industry 
with the dtla agreement the company became a full adopter of dtcp license technology which is used to encrypt the interconnections between devices such as satellite receivers  personal computers and portable media players 
consequently  content can be transferred through and among these devices  only if incorporating this technology 
the pro idiom digital technology platform provides the hospitality market with a robust  secure digital rights management drm system ensuring rapid  broad deployment of hd television hdtv and other high value digital content to licensed users in the lodging industry 
lodging industry leaders such as world cinema inc  lodgenet entertainment corporation and others have licensed the pro idiom drm system 
a growing number of content providers have demonstrated their acceptance of pro idiom by licensing their hd content for delivery to pro idiom users 
the company s revenues derived from the sale of products incorporating these technologies were  in and  in the mpeg encoder ip core has a unique compression engine capable of creating hd mpeg real time encoding of a single channel of i p i video 
the use of this real time encoding technique enables the company to provide broadcast mpeg hd and sd encoding 
mpeg is widely used as the format of digital television signals that are broadcast by terrestrial over the air  cable  and direct broadcast satellite tv systems 
the company s revenues for digital encoders were  in and  in the h 
avc is the new video compression standard that enables a compelling solution for growing ip video services 
the h 
hd encoder core has the capability to cut the bandwidth requirement for digital video delivery in half when compared against mpeg encoders 
this essentially facilitates the transmission of twice the number of programs in a given bandwidth 
the use of this h 
encoding technique enables the company to provide high quality video at higher resolutions like p i 
h 
is a widely used format for transmitting high quality digital television signals over ip networks 
the company started shipping the h 
encoder in in april  the company obtained a million purchase commitment for the first member of its edgeqam family of products the eqam from world cinema inc world cinema  a supplier of free to guest digital and hd television to the hospitality market 
these shipments were made in the second and third quarters of  during which time the eqam was exclusive to world cinema 
since then  the parties have agreed to extend the exclusivity arrangement  with the most recent extension occurring in december which extended exclusivity through the end of in connection with the most recent extension  world cinema committed to purchase approximately million of eqam from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of world cinema s purchases of this product were approximately  and  in and  respectively 
future purchase commitments by world cinema would allow them to further extend this exclusivity arrangement 
the eqam accepts hd content received by satellite via its ip gigabit ethernet gbe input  adds content protection by utilizing pro idiom encryption  and qam modulates it for distribution over standard coax networks 
on february   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  r 
l 
drake holdings  llc rld  a delaware limited liability company  acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified liabilities of r 
l 
drake  llc  a delaware limited liability company seller the rld acquisition  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement of even date  by and among rld  seller  r 
l 
drake acquisition corporation  a delaware corporation  and wbmk holding company  an ohio corporation  as amended by a certain first amendment to asset purchase agreement dated february  as so amended  the asset purchase agreement 
the purchase price was approximately  which included a working capital adjustment of approximately  plus contingent purchase price payments of up to  in the aggregate that may be made over the three year period after closing if certain financial results are realized 
the assets acquired from seller include assets used in the manufacturing and delivery of electronic communications solutions for cable television systems  digital television reception  video signal distribution and digital video encoding  including equipment  supplies and other tangible personal property  inventory  accounts receivable  business records  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
the asset purchase agreement includes customary representations and warranties and post closing covenants  including indemnification obligations  subject to certain limitations  on behalf of the parties with respect to the asset purchase agreement 
in addition  the seller and certain members of the seller agreed  for a period of five years  not to engage in any business that competes with the business formerly conducted by seller and or sold by seller to rld or the business presently conducted by rld or any affiliate of rld or solicit employees or customers of seller or rld or any affiliate of rld 
rld manufactures and distributes similar products to those currently being produced by the company 
the acquisition allows the company to leverage the combined research and development and sales and marketing departments to shorten the development and manufacturing cycle and deliver a more complete compliment of business and product solutions for the markets the company serves 
the company s manufacturing is allocated primarily between its facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility and a key contract manufacturer located in the people s republic of china prc 
the company currently manufactures most of its digital products  including the latest encoder and edgeqam collections at its old bridge facility 
since the company has transitioned and continues to manufacture certain high volume  labor intensive products  including many of the company s analog products  in the prc  pursuant to a manufacturing agreement that governs the production of products that may from time to time be the subject of purchase orders submitted by and in the discretion of the company 
the company may transition additional products to the prc if determined by the company to be advantageous based upon changing business and market conditions 
manufacturing products both at the company s old bridge facility as well as in the prc  enables the company to realize cost reductions while maintaining a competitive position and time to market advantage 
as a result of the rld acquisition  the company assumed certain post closing obligations for a leased manufacturing  engineering  sales and administrative facility in franklin  ohio at which the rld products were being manufactured 
the lease for this facility expired in november  in anticipation of such expiration  in august the company secured an alternative smaller space in miamisburg  ohio  that it believes is more suitable to its continuing business activities 
the company began the process of transitioning the manufacture of rld products from the franklin  ohio facility to the old bridge facility shortly after the closing of the rld acquisition 
this transition was substantially completed during july and is now complete 
the company may  from time to time  provide manufacturing  research and development and product support services for other companies products 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to provide manufacturing  research and development and product support to buffalo city center leasing  llc buffalo city for an electronic on board recorder that buffalo city was producing for turnpike global technologies  llc which was purchased in by  and operates as a division of  xrs corporation xrs formerly known as xata corporation xata 
a director of the company is also the managing member and a vice president of buffalo city and may be deemed to control the entity which owns fifty percent of the membership interests of buffalo city 
the agreement with buffalo city expired by its terms in the first quarter of  however  buffalo city continued purchasing such product from the company through july  on the same terms and conditions 
in the second quarter of  the company entered into a new agreement directly with xata corporation the xata agreement  which sets forth the terms and conditions of purchases by xata of the next generation of the product 
the xata agreement also permits xata to obtain financing from approved third party lenders to finance its purchases from the company 
in november  the company and buffalo city entered into a letter agreement the buffalo city agreement to memorialize the agreement by which the company approved buffalo city to act as an approved third party lender to xata and has permitted buffalo city in this capacity to purchase products from the company on open account with a credit limit of  the terms for payment of which were net days after shipment 
under the terms of the xata agreement  obligations of buffalo city to the company were guaranteed by xata 
during the first quarter of  buffalo city advised the company that buffalo city would no longer be financing products as an approved third party lender for xata 
as such  effective as of february   the company and buffalo city terminated buffalo city s status as an approved lender under the buffalo city agreement 
all amounts due from buffalo city to the company under the buffalo city agreement were fully paid in the company received no revenue during from buffalo city 
the company received  in revenue from buffalo city in in addition  the company s accounts receivable included  of total accounts receivable due from buffalo city at december  the company continues to contract manufacture products directly for xrs under the xata agreement 
while the termination of the buffalo city agreement did not have a material adverse impact on aggregate sales of these contract manufactured products  recent declines in sales volume to xrs have been experienced  which we believe are attributable to the general decline in economic conditions 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in november and completed its initial public offering in december strategy it is a constant challenge for the company to stay at the forefront of the technological requirements of the markets that it serves  including the cable television system  mdu  lodging hospitality and institutional markets 
changes and developments in the manner in which information whether video  telephony or internet is transmitted as well as the use of alternative compression technologies  all require the company to continue to develop innovative new products 
the company allocates its resources as needed to create innovative products that are responsive to the demand for digital signal generation and transmission 
the company s key product lines are more thoroughly discussed under key products beginning on page the ongoing evolution of the company s product lines focuses on the increased needs created in the digital space by digital video  iptv and hdtv signals and the transport of these signals over state of the art broadband networks 
the primary end users of the company s product are tv broadcasters  cable system operators that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build  lodging hospitality video and high speed internet system operators that specialize in the lodging hospitality markets  and institutional system operators that operate  upgrade and maintain the systems that are in their facilities  or contractors that install  upgrade and maintain these systems in a variety of applications including schools  universities  hospitals  prisons  corporations  sports stadiums and airports 
a key component of the company s growth strategy is to leverage its reputation across a broad product line  offering one stop shop convenience to the cable  broadcast and professional markets and delivering products having a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has historically enjoyed  and continues to enjoy  a leading position in many of the cable markets that it serves 
the company provides integrated network solutions for operators in the multi dwelling unit market  the lodging hospitality market and the institutional market 
in response to market pressures to compete with far east manufactured products  the company manufactures certain high volume  labor intensive products in the prc 
markets overview the television industry has been dominated by the traditional cable operator  who subsequently expanded into high speed internet and telephony services 
the penetration of wireless and direct broadcast satellite dbs such as directv and dish network in the tv market  continues to grow with a combined subscriber count in excess of million 
telephone companies ie verizon and at t also compete with cable operators for services and continue to expand their fiber optic networks  on a national level  delivering video  high speed internet and telephony services direct to the home or to the curb 
cable operators are deploying mpeg ip transport to the edge of their networks via fiber optic networks and converting those ip streams to rf channels so they can continue to provide conventional video services over existing two way coax networks 
their plans are to expand the reach of fiber optic networks to take fiber closer to the customer and to the user 
the long term result of these activities is increased competition for the provision of services and a trend toward delivery of these services through fiber using ip technology 
this continuing major market transition has resulted in increased consumer expectations  placing the lodging and institutional markets under pressure to install new infrastructure and upgrade existing networks 
it is not known how long this transition will take but to remain competitive  the company must continue to increase its product offerings for digital television  encoding and decoding and digital media applications 
with iptv technology comes additional market pressures and opportunities 
first  there is the matter of alternative tv services riding over the top of existing infrastructures or ott television  where the delivered video is not part of the service provider s own video service 
examples include web video services like netflix  hulu  and apple tv 
an additional advent is tv everywhere where video is displayed not only on the traditional television  but also on personal computers and mobile devices 
cable operators are trying to tackle not only the technology issues associated with these offerings  but content management and customer authentication 
the idea that the consumer is at the center  and not the hardware or the network  is revolutionizing how video and media content is delivered 
cable television most cable operators  both large and small  have built networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coax cable to deliver television  internet and phone services on one drop cable 
cable television deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in nearly all existing systems 
the hfc network architecture is employed to provide analog video  digital video  hdtv  high speed internet  video on demand vod and digital telephone service 
with the adoption of new standards by cablelabs  the cable industry is using edge devices  node splitting and digital video switching to increase both services and subscriber capacity from each node 
the company believes that most major metropolitan areas will eventually have complex networks of two or more independent operators interconnecting homes and multi dwelling complexes 
all of these networks are potential users of our digital video headend products including  encoders  edgeqam and digital video solutions 
lodging historically  cable operators serving the lodging market sought to provide more channels especially in hd  vod and enhanced interactivity in response to property owners seeking additional revenue streams and guests demanding increased in room technology services 
initially installed in mostly large hotels  smaller hotels and motels continue to be outfitted with enhanced technology to provide a full suite of hd channels and vod 
more recently  the competition among cable providers to the hospitality industry has shifted from emphasis on vod to demand for an ever increasing number of hd programs provided free to each guest room 
the company believes that the demand for hd based headends that support free to guest service and  accordingly  our edgeqam pro idiom products  will grow for several years 
the rate of growth may be limited by the cost associated with replacing all televisions in a hotel with flat screen pro idiom compatible televisions 
institutional the company defines the institutional market to include educational campus environments  correctional facilities  short or long term health service environments  sports stadiums and airport terminals 
what all of these seemingly unrelated facilities have in common is that they all contain private networks that are dependant on either locally generated or externally sourced video and or data content 
as the advanced technologies of distance learning  hdtv and iptv permeate the market  institutional facilities are embracing these technologies to achieve site specific goals 
the company traditionally benefited from a very strong share of this market with its analog video headend and distribution products 
we anticipate that we will continue to be a leader in this market with our digital video headend products  which include hd encoders  edgeqam  digital video solutions and our evolving iptv platforms 
international the company has authorized distributors and sales agents in various locations outside the united states  but the company primarily manufactures products for sale in the usa 
historically  international sales have not materially contributed to the company s revenue base 
as a result of the rld acquisition  the company s international sales in canada have increased in rld maintains a physical presence in canada  including a stock of inventory  two sales personnel and one sales support person 
additional considerations the technological revolution with respect to video  internet and telephone services continues at a rapid pace 
cable tv s qam video is competing with directv and echostar s dbs service and cable modems compete with digital subscriber lines and fiber to the home offered by regional telephone companies 
telephone companies are building national fiber networks and are now delivering video  internet and telephone services directly to the home over fiber optic cable  and digital telephone is being offered by cable companies and others in competition with traditional phone companies 
the convergence of data and video communications continues  wherein computer and television systems merge 
this merging of technologies is extending services to mobile smart phone devices and tablet computers with over the air data delivery competing with cable delivered services 
since much of the installed base of united states television sets are still analog sets not digital  dbs television  digitally compressed programming and ip delivery continue to require headend products or set top decoding receivers or converters to convert the transmitted signals back to analog 
the replacement of substantially all analog television sets with digital sets remains costly although such costs have decreased substantially over the past several years and will still take years to complete 
the split of analog and digital offerings provided to customers varies as a function of the size of the operator and their deployment strategy 
for example  the majority of private cable and other smaller service providers continue to deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set 
larger multiple system operators msos have transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to all digital or switched digital video platforms 
key products blonder tongue s products can be separated according to function and technology 
three key categories account for the majority of the company s revenue analog video headend  digital video headend  and hfc distribution analog video headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation to create an analog channel lineup for further transmission among the products offered by the company in this category are integrated receiver decoders ird s  modulators  demodulators  channel combiners and processors 
the headend is the brain of an analog television signal distribution system 
it is the central location where multiple channels are initially received  converted and allocated to specific channels for analog distribution 
in some cases  where the signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed  a receiver will also be required to decode the signal 
even though this market is mature  blonder tongue continues to develop products to maintain market share 
for example  several new analog products were launched in response to the calm act the commercial advertisement loudness mitigation act calm  hr s 
 initially proposed in and signed into law in december the calm act requires the fcc to prescribe regulations limiting the volume of audio on commercials transmitted by television broadcast stations  cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors 
this law addresses a widespread consumer complaint regarding the abrupt loudness of television advertisements and mandates that the volume levels of commercial breaks be consistent with the volume level of the related programming 
the company estimates that analog video headend products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
digital video headend products used by a system operator for acquisition  processing and manipulation of digital video signals blonder tongue continues to expand its digital product offerings to meet the changing needs of its customers 
the latest additions include the edgeqam collection and the hd encoder collection which includes a line of hd and sd mpeg and h 
encoders and multiplexers 
this trend is expected to be continued in with the addition of edgeip solutions 
among the other digital products provided by blonder tongue are quadrature phase shift key qpsk to qam transcoders  digital qam up converters and multiplexers  digital vsb qam hd television processors for delivery of hdtv programming and agile qam modulators 
encoders accept and auto detect various input sources analog and or digital and output digitally encoded hd or sd video in various output formats such as asynchronous serial interface asi  ip and qam 
asi is a streaming data format which carries the mpeg transport stream 
the ip output format allows the operators to stream video over private data networks with greater reliability and content security 
whereas  the qam outputs may be used for digital video distribution over typical private coax networks in a variety of institutional environments ie sports arenas  broadcast and cable television studios  airports  hospitals  university campuses  etc as a complement to the encoder line  blonder tongue also provides digital qam multiplexers which take multiple inputs asi or vsb qam and deliver a single multiplexed qam output thereby optimizing the hd channel lineup by preserving bandwidth 
edgeqam devices accept ethernet input and capture mpeg over ip transport streams  decrypt service provider conditional access or content protection  and insert proprietary conditional access  such as pro idiom  into the stream 
these streams are then combined and modulated on to qam rf carriers  in most cases providing multiple streams on to one mhz digital channel 
inputs to edgeqam devices can come from satellite receivers  set top boxes  network devices or video servers 
the use of these devices adds flexibility for the service provider  in part  because all of this routing happens in one device 
scaling is accomplished via software and modules embedded inside the hardware 
since it is a true network device  the edgeqam can be managed over a traditional ethernet network or over the internet 
the qpsk to qam transcoders qtm series are used for economically deploying or adding a satellite based digital programming tier of digital or hdtv digital programming 
the unit transcodes a satellite signal s modulation from qpsk to qam or from psk hdtv format to qam 
since qpsk and psk are optimum for satellite transmission and qam is optimum for fiber coax distribution  precious system bandwidth is saved while the signal retains its digital information 
building upon the innovative design work that brought about the qtm transcoders  qam up converters and hdtv processors  the company launched a series of atsc qam demodulators 
digital video headend product use continues to expand in all of the company s primary markets  bringing more advanced technology to consumers and operators  and it is expected that this area will continue to be a major element of the company s business 
the company estimates that digital video headend products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
hfc distribution products used to transport signals from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home  apartment unit  hotel room  office or other terminal location along a fiber optic  coax or hfc distribution network among the products offered by the company in this category are broadband amplifiers  directional taps  splitters and wall outlets for coax distribution and fiber optic transmitters  receivers nodes  and couplers 
in cable television systems  the hfc distribution products are either mounted on exterior telephone poles or encased in pedestals  vaults or other security devices 
in private cable systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building if a single structure or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coax cable and devices 
the non passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio video images 
the company estimates that hfc distribution products accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
other products 
there are a variety of other products that the company sells to a lesser degree  either to fill a customer need or where sales have reduced due to changes in company direction  technology  or market influences 
sales of products in these categories have not contributed significantly to the company s revenues in and are expected to remain this way for these products include digital transition  providing system operators the means to adapt to the fcc mandated transition in broadcast television from analog to digital signals 
addressable  controlling access to analog programming at the subscriber s location 
reception  receiving off air broadcast television and satellite transmissions prior to headend processing 
high speed internet  providing broadband internet access over a hfc network 
technical services  including hands on training  system design engineering  on site field support and complete system verification testing 
miscellaneous  filling customers needs for satellite distribution  test equipment  and parts 
the company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements 
typically  these modifications are minor and do not materially alter product functionality 
thus  the inability of a customer to accept such products does not generally result in the company being unable to sell such products to other customers 
research and product development the markets served by blonder tongue are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete effectively in this environment  the company must engage in ongoing research and development in order to i create new products  ii expand features of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater capability  iii license new technology  and iv acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources 
research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the company s customers and customer prospects  with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders 
projects may also be a result of new technologies that become available  or new market applications of existing technology 
in the new product development process  the vast experience of the company s engineering group is leveraged to ensure the highest level of suitability and widest acceptance in the marketplace 
products tend to be developed in a functional building block approach that allows for different combinations of blocks to generate new relevant products 
additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and engineering lower production costs 
for the acquisition of new technologies  the company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties 
the company will also license technology if it can obtain technology more quickly  or more cost effectively from third parties than it could otherwise develop on its own  or if the desired technology is proprietary to a third party 
there were employees in the research and development department of the company at december   including employees located at the company s facility in miamisburg  ohio 
the company s research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
it is anticipated that research and development expenses will decrease during and thereafter  as compared to  as a result of the synergies of the rld acquisition 
marketing and sales blonder tongue markets and sells its products for use in a wide range of markets including traditional cable television  mdu  lodging hospitality  and institutional schools  hospitals and prisons 
the company also sells into a multitude of niche markets such as sports arenas and the cruise ship industry 
sales are made directly to customers by the company s internal sales force  as well as through premier authorized stocking distributors which accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
these distributors serve multiple markets 
direct sales to cable operators and system integrators accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s sales and marketing function is performed predominantly by its internal sales force 
should it be deemed necessary  the company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects or target market opportunities 
the company s internal sales force consists of employees  which currently includes five salespersons in old bridge  nj  one salesperson in round rock  tx  one in san diego  ca  three salespersons in miamisburg  oh  two salespersons in peterborough  ontario  canada  one sales support person in miamisburg  oh  one sales support person in peterborough  ontario and eight sales support personnel at the company headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s standard customer payment terms are  net days 
from time to time  when circumstances warrant  such as a commitment to a large blanket purchase order  the company will extend payment terms beyond its standard payment terms 
the company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products 
blonder tongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences and also maintains a robust website 
the company publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals  distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of blonder tongue s products and technology by editors of trade journals 
the company provides system design engineering for its customers  maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one on one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers 
blonder tongue supplies sales and applications support  product literature and training to its sales representatives and distributors 
the management of the company travels extensively  identifying customer needs and meeting potential customers 
customers blonder tongue has a diverse customer base  which in consisted of approximately active accounts 
approximately and of the company s revenues in fiscal years and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in both and  sales to world cinema inc accounted for approximately  of the company s revenues 
in addition  toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that sales to these entities  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period  however  the company anticipates that world cinema and toner cable equipment  inc will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods 
although neither of these customers is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period  world cinema committed to purchase approximately million of eqam from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of in order to maintain its exclusive right to purchase such product 
during  the company renewed multi year contracts with key distributors in its premier distributor program 
this program  which began in  has been quite successful for the company 
under this program  a limited group of larger distributors who stock a significant amount of the company s products in their inventory are given access to a special purchase incentive program allowing them to achieve volume price concessions measured on a year to year basis 
many of the company s smaller business customers  with whom the company had formerly dealt on a direct basis  now purchase the company s products from these premier distributors 
in the company s direct sales to system integrators  the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators that may replace the present leading customers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental united states  however  the company also derives some revenues from customers in other geographical markets  primarily canada and to a much more limited extent  in developing countries 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately and of the company s revenues in and  respectively 
all of the company s transactions with customers located outside of the united states have historically been denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has had no material foreign currency transactions 
as a result of the rld acquisition  however  the company derived certain sales from customers located in canada during denominated in canadian dollars 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies have certain inherent risks associated with them due to currency fluctuations 
see risk factors below for more detail on the risks associated with foreign currency transactions 
manufacturing and suppliers blonder tongue s primary manufacturing operations are presently located at the old bridge facility  which also serves as the company s headquarters 
upon consummation of the rld acquisition in february  the company maintained a smaller manufacturing facility in franklin  oh until it was closed in november  as noted in item properties below  the company thereafter opened and maintains a small sales and engineering facility in miamisburg ohio 
the company s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the programming  assembly  and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies 
management continues to implement improvements to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost  including logistics modifications on the factory floor to accommodate increasingly fine pitch surface mount electronic components 
in  these improvements resulted in assemblies of layer pcbs with thousands of components including placement of xmil ball grid arrays and packaged sized components 
these advancements required investment in upgrading automatic placement equipment as well as automated optical inspection and testing systems 
all of these efforts are consistent with and part of the company s strategy to provide its customers with high performance to cost ratio products 
beginning in  the company transitioned and continues to manufacture certain high volume  labor intensive products  including many of the company s analog products  in the prc 
a key contract manufacturer in the prc produces such products as may be requested by the company from time to time in the company s discretion through the submission of purchase orders  the terms of which are governed by a manufacturing agreement 
the company does not currently anticipate the transfer of any additional products to the prc  however this could change if business and market conditions make it advantageous to do so 
in connection with the company s initiatives in the prc  the company may have foreign currency transactions and may be subject to various currency exchange control programs related to its prc operations 
see risk factors below for more detail on the risk of foreign operations 
outside contractors supply standard components  printed circuit boards and electronic subassemblies to the company s specifications 
while the company generally purchases electronic parts that do not have a unique source  certain electronic component parts used within the company s products are available from a limited number of suppliers and may be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts 
if the company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part  the company believes that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented 
however  in such situations the company may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the component shortage 
on an as needed basis  the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as echostar digital receivers for delivery of dish network programming  and directv digital satellite receivers for delivery of directv programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of certain of these components would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company does not have an agreement with any sole source supplier requiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the company 
see risk factors below for more detail on the risk associated with sole supplier products 
blonder tongue maintains a quality assurance program which monitors and controls manufacturing processes  and extensively tests samples throughout the process 
samples of component parts purchased are tested  as well as its finished products  on an ongoing basis 
the company also tests component and sub assembly boards throughout the manufacturing process using commercially available and in house built testing systems that incorporate proprietary procedures 
the highest level of quality assurance is maintained throughout all aspects of the design and manufacturing process 
the extensive in house calibration program assures test equipment integrity and correlation 
this program ensures that all test and measurement equipment that is used in the manufacturing process is calibrated to the same in house reference standard on a consistent basis 
when all test and measurement devices are calibrated in this manner  discrepancies are eliminated between the engineering  manufacturing and quality control departments  thus increasing operational efficiency and ensuring a high level of product quality 
blonder tongue performs final product tests prior to shipment to customers 
in  the company was certified to perform underwriters laboratories ul witness testing of products to ul international standard competition all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than blonder tongue that have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces 
the markets we serve include cable television systems  multi dwelling units  the lodging hospitality market and institutional systems  including hospitals  prisons and schools 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological developments  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than blonder tongue 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could result in price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders 
the principal methods of competition are product differentiation  performance  quality  price  terms  service  technical support and administrative support 
the company believes it is a leader in many of the markets that it serves and differentiates itself from competitors by consistently offering innovative products  providing excellent technical service support and delivering high performance to cost ratio products 
intellectual property the company currently holds several united states and foreign patents  none of which are considered material to the company s present operations  since they do not relate to high volume applications 
because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cable television industry  the company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous stream of new products that are designed to meet its customers needs and that have a high performance to cost ratio 
the company owns a united states trademark registration for the word mark blonder tongue and also on a bt logo 
rld owns a united states trademark registration for the word mark drake 
since  the company has obtained and renewed licenses for a variety of technologies in concert with its digital encoder line of products 
the licenses are from a number of companies including dolby laboratories licensing corporation expires august  digital content protection  llc expires april   dtla expires april   and lg electronics expires december 
these standard licenses are all non exclusive and require payment of royalties based upon the unit sales of the licensed products 
with regard to the licenses expiring in  the company expects to renew these standard licenses on similar terms to those presently in force 
for additional information regarding these licenses  see introduction recent developments starting on page the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technologies and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know how independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the company s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share 
the company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position 
the industries in which the company competes are subject to constant development of new technologies and evolution of existing technologies  many of which are the subject of existing third party patents and new patents are issued frequently 
regulation private cable  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
the company did not incur in and does not anticipate incurring in material capital expenditures for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
the company has authorization to discharge wastewater under the new jersey pollution discharge elimination system discharge to surface waters general industrial stormwater permit  permit no 
nj this permit will expire may  the company intends to renew this permit 
employees as of march   the company employed approximately people  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in a general and administrative capacity 
substantially all of these employees are full time employees 
of the company s employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local  which has a labor agreement with the company that is scheduled to expire in february item a risk factors the company s business operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following risk factors highlight some of these risks 
additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company now deems immaterial may also affect the company and the value of its common stock 
the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this report  should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
solely for purposes of the risk factors in this item a  the terms we  our and us refer to blonder tongue laboratories  inc and its subsidiaries 
any substantial decrease in sales to our largest customers may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in and  sales to world cinema accounted for approximately  while sales to toner cable equipment inc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these customers will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
we anticipate  however  that world cinema and toner cable will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods  although they are not obligated to purchase any specified amount of products beyond outstanding purchase orders or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
world cinema  committed to purchase approximately million of eqam from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of in order to maintain its exclusive right to purchase such product 
with respect to our direct sales to system integrators  the complement of leading customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
our success with these customers will depend in part on the viability of those customers  our ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects  and our ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such customers 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from sales to our five largest customers 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  their inability to pay their trade accounts owing to us  or our inability to develop solid relationships with integrators that may replace the present leading customers  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we continually analyze our slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices  we establish reserves 
if we do not meet our sales expectations  these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
although we believe reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value  there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future 
significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an inability to develop  or acquire the rights to technology  products or applications in response to changes in industry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability 
both the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to be successful  we must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs  through the timely development and introduction of new products  enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties 
this is particularly true at this time as the company must develop and market new digital products to offset the continuing decline in demand for  and therefore sales of  analog products 
although we depend primarily on our own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products  we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when we believe that we can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own  or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party 
there can  however  be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the communications industry generally  we will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs  technologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed  or successfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
anticipated increases in direct and indirect competition with us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than us  which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we have 
we expect that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition through price reductions  loss of market share  delays in the timing of customer orders  and an inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market 
our sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by the cable infrastructure operators that we serve in the mdu  lodging and institutional cable markets 
the vast majority of our revenues in fiscal years and came from sales of our products for use by cable infrastructure operators 
demand for our products depends to a large extent upon capital spending on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
capital spending by private cable operators and  therefore  our sales and profitability  are dependent on a variety of factors  including access by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures  demand for their cable services  availability of alternative video delivery technologies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over build existing cable system infrastructures  or constructing  rebuilding  maintaining and upgrading their systems 
there can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining  or upgrading their systems 
any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions 
during and  the us economy continued to feel the effects of the significant economic downturn that began in  resulting in elevated levels of financial market volatility  customer uncertainty and widespread concerns about the us and world economies 
the ongoing effects of these circumstances may negatively impact the demand for our products and our allowance for doubtful accounts  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the economic crisis has had a material and direct impact on financial institutions  resulting in a deterioration of liquidity in the capital markets 
this liquidity crunch could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our customers to borrow funds to support operations or other liquidity needs including the ability to finance capital expenditures or otherwise borrow or raise capital 
moreover  our stock price could decrease if investors have concerns that our business  financial condition or results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn 
any significant casualty to our facility in old bridge  new jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our business operations 
we primarily operate out of one manufacturing facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility 
while we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance  a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of our ability to manufacture at  or otherwise use  that facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
during the third quarter of  as a result of hurricane sandy  we were forced to suspend our operations for four and one half days 
no material damage was sustained at the old bridge facility and the company does not believe that the suspension of our operations for those several days had a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
our dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not otherwise available or to do so only at increased prices 
we purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as certain components of echostar s digital satellite receiver decoders  which are specifically designed to work with the dish network  and certain components of hughes network systems digital satellite receivers which are specifically designed to work with directv programming 
our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components  our receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices  or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of our products 
our contract manufacturing in the prc may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political  regulatory  legal and labor conditions in the prc 
we manufacture and assemble some of our products in the prc  under a contract manufacturing arrangement with a certain key chinese manufacturer 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to  or any other problems arising from  having our products manufactured in the prc  including the following risks political  economic and labor instability  changes in foreign or united states government laws and regulations  including exchange control regulations  increased costs related to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  infringement of our intellectual property rights  and difficulties in managing foreign manufacturing operations 
although the prc has a large economy  its potential economic  political  legal and labor developments entail uncertainties and risks 
in the event of any changes that adversely affect our ability to manufacture in the prc after products have been successfully transitioned out of the united states  our business could suffer 
shifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense 
over time we may shift additional portions of our manufacturing operations to the prc in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiency 
this could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future  which in turn could entail significant one time earnings charges to account for severance  equipment write offs or write downs and moving expenses 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the rld acquisition  or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the rld acquisition  which was consummated in february  will depend  to a large extent  on our ability to integrate and leverage the intellectual property acquired in the rld acquisition with our existing intellectual property  integrate and cross sell rld and blonder tongue products and solutions to the combined customer base of the company and rld  in order to provide each customer with the most effective and efficient solutions available in the market  and coordinate and effect synergistic collaboration among our newly acquired and existing engineering teams 
the ineffective or inefficient implementation of these efforts could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us 
our failure to meet the challenges involved in these efforts or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  even if all of the foregoing efforts are successfully implemented  we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction  including the synergies  cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect 
these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame  or at all 
our earnings would be reduced if our goodwill or intangible assets recorded as part of the rld acquisition were to become impaired 
we recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as part of the rld acquisition in february goodwill is generated when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
we also have certain intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if our goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with the rld acquisition were determined to be impaired  then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized 
any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill or intangible assets would not impact cash flow  tangible capital or liquidity 
we may face risks relating to currency fluctuations and currency exchange 
historically the company has had limited exposure to currency fluctuations since transactions with customers located outside the united states have generally been denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the rld acquisition  however  the company recognized sales in canada in  denominated in canadian dollars and anticipates that it will continue to recognize sales in canada denominated in canadian dollars in future periods 
in addition  the company incurs certain expenses which are denominated in canadian dollars in connection with the maintenance and operation of a sales and distribution facility in canada 
the company functional currency is the us dollar 
accordingly  any revenue and expense denominated in canadian dollars needs to be translated into us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
we do not engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations 
the company anticipates that sales in canada during should be less than  currency fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
competitors may develop products that are similar to  and compete with  our products due to our limited proprietary protection 
we possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to our technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know how 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with our products 
such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
patent infringement claims against us or our customers  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant costs 
while we do not believe that our products including products and technologies licensed from others infringe valid intellectual property rights of any third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted against us or our customers 
damages for infringement of valid intellectual property rights of third parties could be substantial  and if determined to be willful  can be trebled 
such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims  we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers  we could seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances  a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to obtain a license to a third party s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
during  k tech telecommunications  inc k tech filed a patent infringement claim against the company and rld seeking an injunction and damages  as described in more detail below under item legal proceedings 
any increase in governmental regulation of the cable markets that we serve  including the cable television system  mdu  lodging and institutional markets  may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the cable television  mdu  lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry  which represents the vast majority of our business  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on these cable markets resulting in  among other things  barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures 
any such regulations  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
private cable system operation is not presently burdened with significant government regulation  other than  in some cases  certain fcc licensing requirements 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted which would re impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in  among other things  the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas 
any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any increase in governmental environmental regulations or our inability or failure to comply with existing environmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
we do not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us 
further  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations 
any failure by us to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
losing the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees  or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees  could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key executives and technical and management personnel  including james a 
luksch  chief executive officer  and robert j 
pall  president and chief operating officer 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  manufacturing  marketing and managerial personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our organizational documents and delaware state law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting  does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors  does not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings  provides for a classified board of directors  and imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
these provisions and the board s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire our company  preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock  or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company 
we are also afforded the protection of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  impede a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving us  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
any of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
it is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
moreover  our loan agreement with sovereign business capital prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our common stock 
potential fluctuations in the stock price for our common stock may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community s expectations  and market conditions for cable industry stocks in general  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
delays or difficulties in negotiating a labor agreement or other difficulties in our relationship with our union employees may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations 
all of our direct labor employees located at the old bridge  new jersey facility are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local the union  under a collective bargaining agreement  which expires in february in connection with any renewal or renegotiation of the labor agreement upon its termination  there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur or that we will be able to agree upon terms for future agreements with the union 
any work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business operations  results of operations and financial condition

the company is defending the litigation  and has answered the complaint denying the allegations of infringement and asserting defenses of invalidity of the k tech patents 
the company is also engaged in continuing discussions with k tech to potentially resolve the litigation 
as of december   the company s chief executive officer was indebted to the company in the amount of  for which no interest has been charged 
this indebtedness arose from a series of cash advances made to the chief executive officer  the latest of which was advanced in february  this debt was being repaid at the rate of  per month  all of which represented principal payments on the indebtedness  until november when the chief executive officer and his spouse filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code

l 
drake acquisition corporation  a delaware corporation  and wbmk holding company  an ohio corporation  as amended by a certain first amendment to asset purchase agreement dated february  as so amended  the asset purchase agreement 
the purchase price was approximately  which included a working capital adjustment of approximately  plus contingent purchase price payments of up to  in the aggregate that may be made over the three year period after closing if certain financial results are realized 
the assets acquired from seller include assets used in the manufacturing and delivery of electronic communications solutions for cable television systems  digital television reception  video signal distribution and digital video encoding  including equipment  supplies and other tangible personal property  inventory  accounts receivable  business records  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
the asset purchase agreement includes customary representations and warranties and post closing covenants  including indemnification obligations  subject to certain limitations  on behalf of the parties with respect to the asset purchase agreement 
in addition  the seller and certain members of the seller agreed  for a period of five years  not to engage in any business that competes with the business formerly conducted by seller and or sold by seller to rld or the business presently conducted by rld or any affiliate of rld or solicit employees or customers of seller or rld or any affiliate of rld 
rld manufactures and distributes similar products to those currently being produced by the company 
the acquisition allows the company to leverage the combined research and development and sales and marketing departments to shorten the development and manufacturing cycle and deliver a more complete compliment of business and product solutions for the markets the company serves 
the company s manufacturing is allocated primarily between its facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility and a key contract manufacturer located in the people s republic of china prc 
the company currently manufactures most of its digital products  including the latest encoder and edgeqam collections at the old bridge facility 
since the company has transitioned and continues to manufacture certain high volume  labor intensive products  including many of the company s analog products  in the prc  pursuant to a manufacturing agreement that governs the production of products that may from time to time be the subject of purchase orders submitted by and in the discretion of the company 
the company may transition additional products to the prc if determined by the company to be advantageous based upon changing business and market conditions 
manufacturing products both at the company s old bridge facility as well as in the prc  enables the company to realize cost reductions while maintaining a competitive position and time to market advantage 
as a result of the rld acquisition  the company assumed certain post closing obligations for a leased manufacturing  engineering  sales and administrative facility in franklin  ohio at which the rld products were being manufactured 
the lease for this facility expired in november  in anticipation of such expiration  in august the company secured an alternative smaller space in miamisburg  ohio  that it believes is more suitable to its continuing business activities 
the company began the process of transitioning the manufacture of rld products from the franklin  ohio facility to the old bridge facility shortly after the closing of the rld acquisition 
this transition was substantially completed during july and is now complete 
the company may  from time to time  provide manufacturing  research and development and product support services for other companies products 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to provide manufacturing  research and development and product support to buffalo city center leasing  llc buffalo city for an electronic on board recorder that buffalo city was producing for turnpike global technologies  llc which was purchased in by  and operates as a division of  xrs corporation xrs  formerly known as xata corporation xata 
a director of the company is also the managing member and a vice president of buffalo city and may be deemed to control the entity which owns fifty percent of the membership interests of buffalo city 
the agreement with buffalo city expired by its terms in the first quarter of  however  buffalo city continued purchasing such product from the company through july  on the same terms and conditions 
in the second quarter of  the company entered into a new agreement directly with xata corporation the xata agreement  which sets forth the terms and conditions of purchases by xata of the next generation of the product 
the xata agreement also permits xata to obtain financing from approved third party lenders to finance its purchases from the company 
in november  the company and buffalo city entered into a letter agreement the buffalo city agreement to memorialize the agreement by which the company approved buffalo city to act as an approved third party lender to xata and has permitted buffalo city in this capacity to purchase products from the company on open account with a credit limit of  the terms for payment of which were net days after shipment 
under the terms of the xata agreement  obligations of buffalo city to the company were guaranteed by xata 
during the first quarter of  buffalo city advised the company that buffalo city would no longer be financing products as an approved third party lender for xata 
as such  effective as of february   the company and buffalo city terminated buffalo city s status as an approved lender under the buffalo city agreement 
all amounts due from buffalo city to the company under the buffalo city agreement were fully paid in the company received no revenue during from buffalo city 
the company received  in revenue from buffalo city in in addition  the company s accounts receivable included  of total accounts receivable due from buffalo city at december  the company continues to contract manufacture products directly for xrs under the xata agreement 
while the termination of the buffalo city agreement did not have a material adverse impact on aggregate sales of these contract manufactured products  recent declines in sales volume to xrs have been experienced  which we believe are attributable to the general decline in economic conditions

critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required 
you should also review note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company records revenue when products are shipped 
legal title and risk of loss with respect to the products pass to customers at the point of shipment 
customers do not have a right to return products shipped 
products carry a three year warranty  which amount is not material to the company s operations 
inventory and obsolescence the company periodically analyzes anticipated product sales based on historical results  current backlog and marketing plans 
based on these analyses  the company estimates and projects those products that are unlikely to be sold during the next twelve months 
inventories that are not anticipated to be sold in the next twelve months  have been classified as non current 
approximately of the non current inventories are comprised of finished goods 
the company has established a program to use interchangeable parts in its various product offerings and to modify certain of its finished goods to better match customer demands 
in addition  the company has instituted additional marketing programs to dispose of the slower moving inventories 
the company continually analyzes its slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes for finished goods  historical and projected usage of raw materials  and anticipated selling prices  the company establishes reserves 
if the company does not meet its sales expectations these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from customers to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectability of those balances 
management s estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowances and net earnings 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management assumptions  these allowances may need to be adjusted in the future 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value may be impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
if impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the long lived asset 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each long lived asset are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the future cash flows estimated by management in their impairment analyses may not be achieved 
valuation of deferred tax assets management periodically evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of its deferred income tax assets considering several factors  including the estimate of the likelihood that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future years in which temporary differences reverse 
due to the uncertainties related to  among other things  the extent and timing of future taxable income  which currently indicates that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize the benefits related to the deferred tax assets  the company recorded a valuation allowance equal to a significant portion of the net deferred tax assets as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income 
asu finalized the reporting for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which was previously deferred  as discussed below 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
however  they do require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
an entity is also required to present on the face of the financials where net income is reported or in the footnotes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
other amounts need only be cross referenced to other disclosures required that provide additional detail of these amounts 
the amendments in this update are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment which improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among long lived asset categories 
these amended standards permit an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
for assets in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu defers the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of aoci in both net income and oci on the face of the financial statements 
all other requirements in asu no 
are not affected by asu no 
 including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
these requirements are in effect for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the fasb  the emerging issues task force and the sec have issued certain other accounting standards updates and regulations as of december  that will become effective in subsequent periods  however  management of the company does not believe that any of those updates would have significantly affected the company s financial accounting measures or disclosures had they been in effect during or  and does not believe that any of those pronouncements will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements at the time they become effective
