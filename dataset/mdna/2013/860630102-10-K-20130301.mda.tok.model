external factors impacting our business performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity 
overall market conditions are a product of many factors  which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable 
these factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors  including their level of participation in the financial markets 
in turn  these decisions may affect our business results 
with respect to financial market activity  our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions  the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets  the level and shape of various yield curves  the volume and value of trading in securities  and the value of our customers assets under management 
the municipal underwriting market is challenging as state and local governments reduce their debt levels 
investors are showing a lack of demand for longer dated municipals and are reluctant to take on credit or liquidity risks 
investor confidence has been dampened by continued uncertainty surrounding the us fiscal and debt ceiling  the debt concerns in europe  and sluggish employment growth 
our overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction and activity levels of the united states equity and fixed income markets 
at december   the key indicators of the markets performance  the dow jones industrial average  s p  and the nasdaq closed   and higher than their december  closing prices  respectively 
as a participant in the financial services industry  we are subject to complicated and extensive regulation of our business 
the recent economic and political environment has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives  both enacted and proposed  that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and may significantly impact us 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act will have a broad impact on the financial services industry and will impose significant new regulatory and compliance requirements  including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically significant  the imposition of increased capital  leverage  and liquidity requirements  and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthen safety and soundness within  the financial services sector 
the expectation is that this new legislation will significantly restructure and increase regulation in the financial services industry  which could increase our cost of doing business  change certain business practices  and alter the competitive landscape

held to maturity securities are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost  and the changes in the value of these securities  other than impairment charges  are not reported on the consolidated financial statements 
other than temporary impairment we evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position quarterly to assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
our other than temporary impairment otti assessment is a subjective process requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
accordingly  we consider a number of qualitative and quantitative criteria in our assessment  including the extent and duration of the impairment  recent events specific to the issuer and or industry to which the issuer belongs  the payment structure of the security  external credit ratings and the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments  the value of underlying collateral  and current market conditions 
if we determine that impairment on our debt securities is other than temporary and we have made the decision to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize the entire portion of the impairment in earnings 
if we have not made a decision to sell the security and we do not expect that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognize only the credit component of otti in earnings 
the remaining unrealized loss due to factors other than credit  or the non credit component  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we determine the credit component based on the difference between the security s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows  discounted based on the purchase yield 
the non credit component represents the difference between the security s fair value and the present value of expected future cash flows 
based on the evaluation  we recognized a credit related otti of million and million in earnings for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows include default rates  loss severity and prepayment rates 
assumptions used can vary widely based on the collateral underlying the securities and are influenced by factors such as collateral type  loan interest rate  geographical location of the borrower  and borrower characteristics 
we believe the gross unrealized losses related to all other securities of million as of december  are attributable to issuer specific credit spreads and changes in market interest rates and asset spreads 
we  therefore  do not expect to incur any credit losses related to these securities 
in addition  we have no intent to sell these securities with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost 
accordingly  we have concluded that the impairment on these securities is not other than temporary

a loan is determined to be impaired  usually when principal or interest becomes days past due or when collection becomes uncertain

we currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock 
liquidity risk management our businesses are diverse  and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable  and the terms eg  interest rates  collateral provisions and tenor or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
we manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products

our liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions  support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services and products  acquire technologies  or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements 
we primarily rely on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies  and repurchase our shares 
net capital rules  restrictions under our borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries  as well as the earnings  financial condition  and cash requirements of our subsidiaries  may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries 

table of contents the availability of outside financing  including access to the capital markets and bank lending  depends on a variety of factors  such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit rating 
our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically  lenders may from time to time curtail  or even cease  to provide funding to borrowers 
our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material business impact 
the principal elements of our liquidity management framework are a daily monitoring of our liquidity needs at the holding company and significant subsidiary level  b stress testing the liquidity position at stifel bank  and c diversification of our funding sources 
monitoring of liquidity senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies 
these policies include senior management s review of short and long term cash flow forecasts  review of monthly capital expenditures  the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing  and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries 
our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider  among other factors  projected profitability and cash flow  risk and impact on future liquidity needs 
our treasury department assists in evaluating  monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition  liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders 
the objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity 
liquidity stress testing stifel bank stifel bank performs two primary stress tests on its liquidity position 
these stress tests are based on the following company specific stresses the amount of deposit run off that stifel bank could withstand over a one month period of time based on its on balance sheet liquidity and available credit  and stifel bank s ability to fund operations if all available credit were to be drawn immediately  with no additional available credit 
the goal of these stress tests is determine stifel bank s ability to fund continuing operations under significant pressures on both assets and liabilities 
under both stress tests  stifel bank considers cash and highly liquid investments as available to meet liquidity needs 
in its analysis  stifel bank considers agency mbs  corporate bonds  and cmbs as highly liquid 
in addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels  stifel bank estimates that each of the individual securities within each of the asset classes described above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions  assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated

the following table summarizes the activity related to our company s demand note receivable from january  to december  in thousands december  beginning balance notes issued organic growth notes issued acquisitions amortization other ending balance notes issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of s y in we have paid million in the form of upfront notes to financial advisors for transition pay during the year ended december  as we continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by market displacement and as competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases  we may decide to devote more significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

table of contents we utilize transition pay  principally in the form of upfront demand notes  to aid financial advisors  who have elected to join our firm  to supplement their lost compensation while transitioning their customers accounts to the stifel platform 
the initial value of the notes is determined primarily by the financial advisors trailing production and assets under management 
these notes are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period based on production 
the future estimated amortization expense of the upfront notes  assuming current year production levels and static growth for the years ended december       and thereafter are million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively

net capital requirements we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to capital requirements  which may limit distributions to our company from our subsidiaries 
distributions from our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules 
these subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements 
however  if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules  it could have a material and adverse affect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital  such as underwriting or trading activities  or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies  pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt  and or repurchase our common stock 
our non broker dealer subsidiary  stifel bank is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
our broker dealer subsidiaries and stifel bank have consistently operated in excess of their capital adequacy requirements 
at december   stifel nicolaus had net capital of million  which was of aggregate debit items and million in excess of its minimum required net capital 
at december   csa s net capital exceeded the minimum net capital required under the sec rule

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments  and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments  and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions  judgments  and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 

table of contents for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of financial instruments we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash equivalents  trading securities owned  available for sale securities  investments  trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  and derivatives 
trading securities owned and pledged and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition  with unrealized gains and losses reflected on the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  or an exit price 
the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment used in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction  and overall market conditions generally 
when available  we use observable market prices  observable market parameters  or broker or dealer quotes bid and ask prices to derive the fair value of financial instruments 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our trading securities and other investments owned  trading securities pledged as collateral  and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors we consider in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term  and the differences could be material 
we have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three level classification in accordance with topic  fair value measurement and disclosures 
fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as level  and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no direct observable levels are generally categorized as level all other fair value measurements of financial instruments that do not fall within the level or level classification are considered level the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management 
level financial instruments have little to no pricing observability as of the report date 
these financial instruments do not have active two way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
we have identified level financial instruments to include certain asset backed securities  consisting 
table of contents of collateral loan obligation securities  that have experienced low volumes of executed transactions  certain corporate bonds and equity securities where there was less frequent or nominal market activity  investments in private equity funds  and auction rate securities for which the market has been dislocated and largely ceased to function 
our level asset backed securities are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs 
level corporate bonds are valued using prices from comparable securities 
equity securities with unobservable inputs are valued using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs require significant management judgment 
auction rate securities are valued based upon our expectations of issuer redemptions and using internal models 
at december   level assets for which we bear economic exposure were million or of the total assets measured at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded purchases of million and sales and redemptions of million of level assets 
we transferred million  net  out of level during the year ended december  our valuation adjustments realized and unrealized increased the value of our level assets by million 
at december   level assets for which we bear economic exposure were million or of the total assets measured at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded purchases of million and sales and redemptions of million of level assets 
we transferred million  net  into level during the year ended december  our valuation adjustments realized and unrealized increased the value of our level assets by million 
at december   level assets included the following million of auction rate securities and million of private equity  municipal securities  and other fixed income securities 
investments in partnerships investments in partnerships and other investments include our general and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships and direct investments in non public companies 
these interests are carried at estimated fair value 
the net assets of investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in non marketable securities 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships and direct investments in non public companies are valued based on estimated fair value ultimately determined by us in our capacity as general partner or investor and  in the case of an investment in an unaffiliated investment partnership  are based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  and the differences could be material 
increases and decreases in estimated fair value are recorded based on underlying information of these non public company investments  including third party transactions evidencing a change in value  market comparables  operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
in cases where an estimate of fair value is determined based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner  such financial statements are generally unaudited other than audited year end financial statements 
upon receipt of audited financial statements from an investment partnership  we adjust the fair value of the investments to reflect the audited partnership results if they differ from initial estimates 
we also perform procedures to evaluate fair value estimates provided by unaffiliated general partners 
at december   we had commitments to invest in affiliated and unaffiliated investment partnerships of million 
these commitments are generally called as investment opportunities are identified by the underlying partnerships 
these commitments may be called in full at any time 
the investment partnerships in which we are general partner may allocate carried interest and make carried interest distributions  which represent an additional allocation of net realized and unrealized gains to the general partner if the partnerships investment performance reaches a threshold as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
these allocations are recognized in revenue as realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in partnerships 
our recognition of allocations of carried interest gains and losses from the investment partnerships in revenue is not adjusted to reflect expectations about future performance of the partnerships 
as the investment partnerships realize proceeds from the sale of their investments  they may make cash distributions as provided for in the partnership agreements 
distributions that result from carried interest may subsequently become subject to claw back if the fair value of private equity partnership assets subsequently decreases in fair value 
to the extent these decreases in fair value and allocated losses exceed our capital account balance  a liability is recorded by us 
these liabilities for claw back obligations are not required to be paid to the investment partnerships until the dissolution of such partnerships  and are only required to be paid if the cumulative amounts actually distributed exceed the amount due based on the cumulative operating results of the partnerships 

table of contents we earn fees from the investment partnerships that we manage or of which we are a general partner 
such management fees are generally based on the net assets or committed capital of the underlying partnerships 
we have agreed  in certain cases  to waive management fees  in lieu of making a cash contribution  in satisfaction of our general partner investment commitments to the investment partnerships 
in these cases  we generally recognize our management fee revenues at the time when we are allocated a special profit interest in realized gains from these partnerships 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration  and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with topic topic  contingencies  to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires us to use significant judgment  and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
this determination is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are subject to potentially significant revision as more information becomes available and due to subsequent events 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
see item  legal proceedings  in part i of this report for information on our legal  regulatory  and arbitration proceedings 
allowance for loan losses we regularly review the loan portfolio and have established an allowance for loan losses for inherent losses estimated to have occurred in the loan portfolio through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
in providing for the allowance for loan losses  we consider historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collectible 
factors considered in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
we determine the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  when principal or interest becomes days past due or when collection becomes uncertain  the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued non accrual status  and any accrued and unpaid interest income is reversed 
loans placed on non accrual status are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments are collected and the collectibility of future principal and interest payments is reasonably assured 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is certain 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan loss large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for non homogeneous loans and a specific allowance is established for individual loans determined to be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the impaired loan to the present value of its expected cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities our derivative instruments are carried on the consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value 
we utilize these derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our company s goal is to manage sensitivity to changes in rates by offsetting the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain assets and liabilities  thereby limiting the impact on earnings 
the use of derivative instruments does expose our company to credit and market risk 
we manage credit risk through strict counterparty credit risk limits and or collateralization agreements 
at inception  we determine if a derivative instrument meets the criteria for hedge accounting under topic  derivatives and hedging 
ongoing effectiveness evaluations are made for instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges 
if the derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  no assessment of effectiveness is needed 
income taxes the provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on our consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities  and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to our tax return filings 
factors considered in estimating our liability are results of tax audits  historical experience  and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts 
topic topic  income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  topic provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
goodwill and intangible assets under the provisions of topic  business combinations  we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires certain estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
in accordance with topic  intangibles goodwill and other  indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
rather  they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
this test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities as well as identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each calendar year 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist 
we test for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is generally at the level of or one level below our company s business segments 
for both the annual and interim tests  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is not required 
however  if we conclude otherwise  we are then required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test 
goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value 
if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired 
if the estimated fair value is below carrying value  however  further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment 
additionally  if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired  further analysis is required 
the estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units 
our annual goodwill impairment testing was completed as of july   with no impairment identified 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
assumptions  judgments  and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  economic trends and market conditions  changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies  unanticipated competition  discount rates  technology  or government regulations 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
in addition to discounted cash flows  we consider other information  such as public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments  and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments  and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
identifiable intangible assets  which are amortized over their estimated useful lives  are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable

an employee will realize income as a result of an award of stock units at the time shares are distributed in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at that time  and we are entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the year of issuance 
unless an employee elects to satisfy the withholding in another manner  either by paying the amount in cash or by delivering shares of stifel financial corp

based on current tax law  we anticipate that the shares issued when the awards are paid to the employees will be reduced by approximately to satisfy the minimum withholding obligations  so that approximately of the total restricted stock units that are distributable in any particular year will be converted into issued and outstanding shares

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of our business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to our soundness and profitability 
risk management at our company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment  and knowledge of financial products and markets 
our senior management group takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring  and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in our business activities are market interest rates and equity prices  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
we have adopted policies and procedures concerning risk management  and our board of directors  in exercising its oversight of management s activities  conducts periodic reviews and discussions with management regarding the guidelines and policies governing the processes by which risk assessment and risk management are handled 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by our company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices is referred to as market risk 
market risk is inherent to financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management procedures includes all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
we trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations  including us treasury bills  notes  and bonds  us government agency and municipal notes and bonds  bank certificates of deposit  mortgage backed securities  and corporate obligations 
we are also an active market maker in over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  we may maintain inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions 
changes in value of our financial instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings  equity prices  and the correlation among these factors  along with the level of volatility 
we manage our trading businesses by product and have established trading departments that have responsibility for each product 
the trading inventories are managed with a view toward facilitating client transactions  considering the risk and profitability of each inventory position 
position limits in trading inventory accounts are established and monitored on a daily basis 
we monitor inventory levels and results of the trading departments  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration  and securities ratings 
we are also exposed to market risk based on our other investing activities 
these investments consist of investments in private equity partnerships  start up companies  venture capital investments  and zero coupon us government securities and are included under the caption investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on our interest earning assets including client loans  stock borrow activities  investments  inventories  and resale agreements and our funding sources including client cash balances  stock lending activities  bank borrowings  and repurchase agreements  which finance these assets 
the collateral underlying financial instruments at the broker dealer is repriced daily  thus requiring collateral to be delivered as necessary 
interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending produce a positive spread to our company  with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel 
we manage our inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
while a significant portion of our securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over several times per year 

table of contents additionally  we monitor  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in our trading portfolios using a ten day horizon and report var at a confidence level 
var is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility 
this model assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes  and trading losses on any given day could exceed the reported var by significant amounts in unusually volatile markets 
further  the model involves a number of assumptions and inputs 
while we believe that the assumptions and inputs we use in our risk model are reasonable  different assumptions and inputs could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table sets forth the high  low  and daily average var for our trading portfolios during the year ended december   and the daily var at december  and in thousands year ended december  var calculation at december  high low daily average daily var stifel bank s interest rate risk is principally associated with changes in market interest rates related to residential  consumer  and commercial lending activities  as well as fdic insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker dealer subsidiaries and to the general public 
our primary emphasis in interest rate risk management for stifel bank is the matching of assets and liabilities of similar cash flow and repricing time frames 
this matching of assets and liabilities reduces exposure to interest rate movements and aids in stabilizing positive interest spreads 
stifel bank has established limits for acceptable interest rate risk and acceptable portfolio value risk 
to ensure that stifel bank is within the limits established for net interest margin  an analysis of net interest margin based on various shifts in interest rates is prepared each quarter and presented to stifel bank s board of directors 
stifel bank utilizes a third party model to analyze the available data 
the following table illustrates the estimated change in net interest margin at december   based on shifts in interest rates of up to positive basis points and negative basis points hypothetical change in interest rates projected change in net interest margin n a n a 
table of contents the following gap analysis table indicates stifel bank s interest rate sensitivity position at december  in thousands repricing opportunities months months years years interest earning assets loans securities interest bearing cash interest bearing liabilities transaction accounts and savings certificates of deposit borrowings gap cumulative gap we maintain a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our goal is to manage sensitivity to changes in rates by hedging the maturity characteristics of fed funds based affiliated deposits  thereby limiting the impact on earnings 
by using derivative instruments  we are exposed to credit and market risk on those derivative positions 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and  as a result  may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities 
we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day 
our equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis  and there are no unrecorded gains or losses 
our activities as a dealer are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a positive spread 
credit risk we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities  with the counterparties primarily being broker dealers 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  we may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions  and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
our client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities 
we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
we have accepted collateral in connection with resale agreements  securities borrowed transactions  and customer margin loans 
under many agreements  we are permitted to sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use these securities to enter into securities lending arrangements or to deliver to counterparties to cover short positions 
at december   the fair value of securities accepted as collateral where we are permitted to sell or repledge the securities was million  and the fair value of the collateral that had been sold or repledged was million 

table of contents by using derivative instruments  we are exposed to credit and market risk on those derivative positions 
credit risk is equal to the fair value gain in a derivative  if the counterparty fails to perform 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty owes our company and  therefore  creates a repayment risk for our company 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counterparty and  therefore  have no repayment risk 
we minimize the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management 
stifel bank extends credit to individual and commercial borrowers through a variety of loan products  including residential and commercial mortgage loans  home equity loans  construction loans  and non real estate commercial and consumer loans 
bank loans are generally collateralized by real estate  real property  or other assets of the borrower 
stifel bank s loan policy includes criteria to adequately underwrite  document  monitor  and manage credit risk 
underwriting requires reviewing and documenting the fundamental characteristics of credit  including character  capacity to service the debt  capital  conditions  and collateral 
benchmark capital and coverage ratios are utilized  which include liquidity  debt service coverage  credit  working capital  and capital to asset ratios 
lending limits are established to include individual  collective  committee  and board authority 
monitoring credit risk is accomplished through defined loan review procedures  including frequency and scope 
we are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions  extend large loans to  or have large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers ie  in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist of securities issued by the us government or its agencies 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities  both with a large number of clients and counterparties  and any potential concentration is carefully monitored 
stock borrow and lending activities are executed under master netting agreements  which gives our company right of offset in the event of counterparty default 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
we seek to limit this risk through careful review of counterparties and borrowers and the use of limits established by our senior management group  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment  and other positions or commitments outstanding 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems  and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes 
we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  we could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions  and damage to our reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance  and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of large numbers of private client group customer claims for sales practice violations 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  we do  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims 
see further discussion on our legal reserves policy under critical accounting policies and estimates in item  part ii and legal proceedings in item  part i of this report 
in addition  we are subject to potentially sizable adverse legal judgments or arbitration awards  and fines  penalties  and other sanctions for non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation by the sec  finra  and state securities regulators in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
as a bank holding company  we are subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
stifel bank is subject to regulation by the fdic 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws 
we have comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of 
table of contents customer funds  the extension of credit  including margin loans  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
we act as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  we have potential legal exposure to claims relating to these securities offerings 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  securities inventory  and receivables from customers and brokers and dealers 
these monetary assets are generally liquid and turn over rapidly and  consequently  are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects various expenses of our company  such as employee compensation and benefits  communications and office supplies  and occupancy and equipment rental  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients 
further  to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
