overview of fiscal year during fiscal year  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions  investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives 
our overall revenue in fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year  reflecting an increase of million  or  in our human health segment revenue and an increase of million  or  in our environmental health segment revenue 
the increase in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year was due to growth in the research market  including the addition of caliper life sciences  inc caliper  as well as growth generated from both our screening and our medical imaging businesses within the diagnostics market 
the increase in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year was due to growth in our informatics offerings within the laboratory services market and growth from our environmental  food and consumer safety and testing products  partially offset by decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets 
in our human health segment during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  we experienced growth in the research market due to continued demand for our in vivo imaging systems with the addition of caliper imaging systems  as well as increased demand for our janus automation tools and our operetta cellular imaging systems 
the growth in the research market was partially offset by reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from reduced research and development spending  as well as a decline in demand for our suite of radioactive reagents  particularly in europe and japan 
we also experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the united states continue to stabilize and from continued expansion of our prenatal  newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states  particularly in emerging markets such as china 
in our medical imaging business  we had continued growth from our traditional diagnostic imaging offerings  as well as increased demand for our complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos imaging technology  particularly in the fields of mammography  dental and orthopedics 
as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers  we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease  which can result in savings of long term health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients  are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 
in our environmental health segment  our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time  while reducing maintenance costs  all of which continue to be critical for our customers 
during fiscal year  we had increased demand for our informatics offerings  and we continued to grow our laboratory services business by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering 
sales of environmental  food and consumer safety and testing products also grew in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  as increased regulations in environmental and food safety markets continued to drive demand for our analytical instrumentation and follow on consumables  particularly in china and south america 
we saw continued strength in our inorganic analysis solutions  such as our nexion mass spectrometer  as trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminant detection for environmental  as well as food and consumer safety  applications 
these increases were partially offset by decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets 
we believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed  resulting in continued demand for efficient  analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions 
our consolidated gross margins increased basis points in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the lower fiscal year mark to market charge for our postretirement benefit plans  increased sales volume  changes in product mix with growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and productivity improvements 
our consolidated operating 
table of contents margin decreased basis points in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the fiscal year pre tax impairment charges of million as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy and increased costs related to growth and productivity investments  partially offset by a lower fiscal year mark to market charge for our postretirement benefit plans  higher gross margins and cost containment and productivity initiatives 
we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the stable spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services 
overall  we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets  deep portfolio of technologies and applications  leading market positions  global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth

we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 
we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years and  with the exception of the caliper acquisition  to be material to our consolidated results of operations  therefore  we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations 
the aggregate revenue and results of operations for haoyuan for the period from the acquisition date to december  were minimal 
the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions  with the exception of caliper  completed during fiscal year for the period from their respective acquisition dates to january  was million 
we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions  from the date of acquisition  is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

table of contents allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date  based on revenue thresholds or product development milestones achieved through given dates  with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 
we may have to pay contingent consideration  related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods  of up to million as of december  as of december   we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisitions of dexela and haoyuan  with an estimated fair value of million 
the earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed three years from the acquisition date 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite lived intangible assets  or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition  and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date 
the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation  plus a normal profit margin thereon 
the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services 
we do not include any costs associated with selling effort  research and development  or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
in most acquisitions  profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating income approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation 
as of december   with the exception of the purchase price allocation for the haoyuan acquisition  the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in fiscal years and were final 
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the haoyuan acquisition was based upon an initial valuation and our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuation are subject to change within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date 
the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances  and residual goodwill 
we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period 
during the measurement period  we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements 
the effect of any measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date 
the effects of such adjustments  if material  will cause changes in depreciation  amortization  or other income or expense recognized in prior periods 
all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement period are included in current period earnings 
contingencies  including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of december   which represents our management s estimate of the total cost of the ultimate remediation of known environmental matters  and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the time period over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a prp  our management does not currently anticipate any 
table of contents additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had  or are expected to have  a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred  the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 
enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc 
collectively  enzo filed a complaint dated october  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
 seeking injunctive and monetary relief against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc 
the complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
we filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo s patents are invalid 
in  after the court issued a decision in regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and  we believe  excluded certain of our products from the coverage of enzo s patents  summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants 
the case was assigned to a new district court judge in january and in march  the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided enzo s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs 
applera corp 
and tropix  inc the connecticut case  which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo s case against us 
in march  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment in the connecticut case 
the district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants 
on september   the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of non infringement 
on december   we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion 
the second motion is pending 
the district court has permitted enzo to take limited discovery directed to the motion with briefing to be concluded in may we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above  and we are contesting the action vigorously 
while this matter is subject to uncertainty  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
tax years after remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  such as singapore  china  finland  germany  netherlands  the united kingdom  italy and the united states 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
however  each of these matters is subject to uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
reporting segment results of continuing operations we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year that will allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective  affordable and accessible around the world

this increase in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year was due primarily to growth in the research market due to continued demand for our in vivo imaging systems with the addition of caliper imaging systems  as well as increased demand for our janus automation tools and our operetta cellular imaging systems 
the growth in the research market was partially offset by a decline in demand for our suite of radioactive reagents  and reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from reduced research and development spending 
we also experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the united states began to stabilize and from continued expansion of our prenatal  newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states  particularly in emerging markets such as china

principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services  and changes in our working capital requirements 
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity  increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt  a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market  increases in interest rates or credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit  that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  a decrease in the market price for our common stock  and volatility in the public debt and equity markets

we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings  which resulted in us being considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period 
at the end of the construction period  we will not be reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs 
we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases will qualify as financing leases under sale leaseback accounting guidance  representing debt obligations for us and non cash investing and financing activities 
as a result  we capitalized million in property and equipment  net  representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt 
in addition  we expect to capitalize additional construction costs  which are not expected to exceed million  and will be partially funded by the lessors to complete the additions to the buildings 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of capital improvements to these buildings  which have been funded by the lessor 
the buildings are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values  which will equal the remaining financing 
table of contents obligation at the end of the lease term 
at the end of the lease term  the remaining balances in property  plant and equipment  net and debt will be reversed against each other 
dividends our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share in each quarter of fiscal years and  resulting in an annual dividend rate of per share 
on january   we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of per share that is payable in may in the future  our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth  repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

the notes  the notes  the financing lease obligations  and other debt facilities  include interest obligations 
as of december  the notes had a carrying value of million 
the amount includes accrued interest  net of tax benefits  and penalties 
we have excluded million  including accrued interest  net of tax benefits  and penalties  from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 
capital expenditures during fiscal year  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year  primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  and to develop information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 
during fiscal year  we also expect to record activity related to capital improvements under our financing lease obligations  which are not expected to exceed million  and will be partially funded by the lessors 
other potential liquidity considerations at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with million available for additional borrowing under the facility 
most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
as a result of the caliper acquisition  we concluded in fiscal year that certain foreign operations did not require the same level of capital as previously expected  and therefore we planned to repatriate approximately million of previously unremitted earnings and have provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings 
as a result of the planned repatriation  we recorded an increase to our tax provision of million in continuing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we expect to utilize tax attributes  primarily those acquired in the caliper acquisition  to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation 
as of december   we had remitted million of the million planned repatriation and we expect to remit the remainder of the planned repatriation amount by the end of fiscal year we expect accumulated non us cash balances 
table of contents will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows  use of us cash balances  external borrowings  or some combination of these sources 
on october   we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program 
on august   we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional million shares of common stock under the repurchase program 
the repurchase program expired on october  on october   our board authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program 
the new repurchase program will expire on october  unless terminated earlier by our board  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
during fiscal year  we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock repurchase programs 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions  under the repurchase program 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions  under the repurchase program 
as of december   approximately million shares authorized by our board under the new repurchase program remained available for repurchase 
from december  through february   we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions  under the new repurchase program 
our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of million 
the repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding  but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 
any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs 
if we continue to repurchase shares  the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources  including cash and cash equivalents  and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability  creating increased volatility in security prices  widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments 
the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold 
increases in credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable  could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
in difficult global financial markets  we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost  or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 
our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we made a contribution of million for the plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
with respect to plans outside of the united states  we expect to contribute approximately million in the aggregate during fiscal year  of which we contributed million to one of our foreign plans during the first quarter of fiscal year we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans 
during fiscal year  we made a contribution of million for the plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states  and million in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the united states 
during fiscal year  we made contributions of million in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the united states 
we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a strategic agreement under which we acquired certain intangible assets and received a license to certain core technology for an analytics and data discovery platform  as well as the exclusive right to distribute the platform in certain scientific research and development markets 
during fiscal year  we paid million for net intangible assets and million for prepaid royalties  and expect to pay an additional million in prepaid royalties within the next year 
royalties are expected to be expensed as revenue is recognized 
effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements during the first quarter of fiscal year we adopted new guidance for certain of our health care businesses that recognize patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered where we do not assess the patient ability to pay at such 
table of contents time 
the new guidance requires us to present the provision for bad debts related to such revenue as a deduction from revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts on the statements of operations 
the effects of the adoption on our consolidated statements of operations were decreases to revenue with corresponding decreases to selling  general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year accordingly  the financial data for all periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates 
we believe that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  warranty costs  bad debts  inventories  accounting for business combinations and dispositions  long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete 
for revenue that includes customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met 
certain of our products require specialized installation 
revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period  or as services are rendered 
in limited circumstances  we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time  such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component  such as cord blood processing and storage 
for these arrangements  the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling price hierarchy 
a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  and management best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
tpe is the price of our or any competitor largely interchangeable products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand alone basis  considering market conditions and entity specific factors 
revenue from software licenses and services was of our total revenue for fiscal year  of our total revenue for fiscal year  and of our total revenue for fiscal year we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and  in some cases  also with consulting services 
for the undelivered elements  we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period 
we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 
we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method  provided that the above criteria have been met 
if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  or if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

table of contents the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
warranty costs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale 
warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
accounts are written off only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand  or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements  or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
business combinations 
business combinations are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest  in process research and development ipr d is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets  or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 
value of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process 
the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january or the first day of each fiscal year 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered 
non amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a non amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
as part of integrating our recent acquisitions  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the perkinelmer trade name 
accordingly  we 
table of contents undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy  which resulted in pre tax impairment charges of million in fiscal year we concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names 
we do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes 
through fiscal year  we assessed the annual impairment testing for our reporting units analytical sciences and laboratory services  diagnostics  life sciences technology and medical imaging 
we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january  and january   and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve  impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 
employee compensation and benefits 
we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and us defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business  and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future  and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations 
we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur 
actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter  unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 
we incurred expenses of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans  which includes the charge for the mark to market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans  which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter 
the expense related to mark to market on postretirement benefit plans was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans  excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark to market adjustment 
it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark to market adjustment in fiscal year mark to market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control  including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 
to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease  mark to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year conversely  to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected  mark to market income will be recorded in fiscal year pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year 
as of december   we estimate the expected long term rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states to be and to be for all plans outside the united states 
in addition  as of december  we estimate the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the united states to be and to be for all plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

table of contents if any of our assumptions were to change as of december   our pension plan expenses would also change 
increase decrease at december  percentage point change non us us pension plans discount rate rate of return on pension plan assets postretirement benefit plans discount rate n a n a rate of return on postretirement benefit plan assets n a n a we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled restructuring and contract termination charges  net 
dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets  and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded million in pre tax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions  and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development tax credit federal r d tax credit from january  to december  as a result  we expect our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year will include an approximate million discrete tax benefit relating to the previously unrecognized federal r d tax credits from january  to december  significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are 
table of contents periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including state net operating loss carryforwards  state income tax credit carryforwards  and certain foreign tax attributes 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences 
these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 
taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider indefinitely reinvested  the determination of which is based on our future operational and capital requirements 
we continue to maintain our indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore do not accrue us tax for the repatriation of the remaining unremitted foreign earnings 
as of december   the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately million 
it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december  we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only  and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments 
by nature  all financial instruments involve market and credit risks 
we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
therefore  the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing  investing and operating the business 
in the ordinary course of business  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 
principal hedged currencies include the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts  designated as fair value hedges  with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  and million at january   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the duration of these contracts was generally days or less during fiscal years   and 
table of contents as of december   we had two cash flow hedges outstanding  and as of january   we had no outstanding cash flow hedges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in fiscal year and combined euro denominated notional amounts of euro million  designated as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of these currency derivative contracts at december  was million 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
as of december   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
we amortized million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years   and market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
moreover  we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states  material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states  resulting in natural hedges 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of december   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year  the value at risk ranged between million and million  with an average of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
as of december   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
we amortized million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years   and interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of december   our debt portfolio consisted of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at december  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year 
table of contents ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate
