item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers 
we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy 
since being organized in  we grew to become  at the time of our initial public offering of stock in april  the nation s largest mutually owned savings and loan association based on total assets 
we credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values love  trust  respect  and a commitment to excellence  along with having fun 
our values are reflected in the design and pricing of our loan and deposit products  and historically  in our home today program  as described below 
our values are further reflected in the broadway redevelopment initiative a long term revitalization program encompassing the three mile corridor of the broadway slavic village neighborhood in cleveland  ohio where our main office was founded and continues to be located and the educational programs we have established and or supported 
we intend to continue to adhere to our primary values and to support our customers and the communities in which we operate 
during the last several years  regionally high unemployment  weak residential real estate values  less than robust capital and credit markets  and a general lack of confidence in the financial services sector of the economy presented significant challenges for us 
more recently  improving regional employment levels  recovering residential real estate values  recovering capital and credit markets and greater confidence in the financial services sector have resulted in better credit metrics for us 
management believes that the following matters are those most critical to our success controlling our interest rate risk exposure  monitoring and limiting our credit risk  maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources  and monitoring and controlling operating expenses 
controlling our interest rate risk exposure 
although housing and credit quality issues have had and  to a lesser extent  continue to have a negative effect on our operating results and  as described below  are certainly a matter of significant concern for us  historically our greatest risk has been our exposure to interest rate risk 
when we hold long term  fixed rate assets  funded by liabilities with shorter re pricing characteristics  we are exposed to potentially adverse impacts from rising interest rates 
generally  and particularly over extended periods of time that encompass full economic cycles  interest rates associated with longer term assets  like fixed rate mortgages  have been higher than interest rates associated with shorter term funding sources  like deposits 
this difference has been an important component of our net interest income and is fundamental to our operations 
we manage the risk of holding long term  fixed rate mortgage assets primarily by maintaining high levels of tangible capital and by promoting adjustable rate and shorter term  fixed rate loans 
additionally  in years prior to fiscal  we also managed this risk by actively selling long term  fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market  a strategy pursuant to which we were able to modulate the amount of long term  fixed rate loans held in our portfolio 
as described in greater detail below  during fiscal we adopted the necessary procedural changes that  subsequent thereto  we believe result in certain of our long term  fixed rate loan originations  those processed under our revised procedures  being eligible for delivery and sale to fnma and will prospectively provide us with additional options in managing our interest rate risk profile 
the total balance of loans sold subsequent to june  has not been significant when measured in relation to the total balance of our owned fixed rate portfolio 
during the fiscal year ended september   we sold million of long term  fixed rate first mortgage loans compared to million and million during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively and as compared to sales of billion during the fiscal year ended september  also  during fiscal we sold million of long term  adjustable rate first mortgage loans to a private investor 
this transaction demonstrated our ability to further manage interest rate risk and liquidity by selling smart rate loans in the secondary market 
no long term  adjustable rate first mortgage loans were sold during any of the fiscal years ended september   or as described in the following paragraphs  the relatively low volume of long term  fixed rate first mortgage loan sales since june  reflects the impact of changes by fnma related to requirements for loans that it accepts and our reduced level of fixed rate loan originations 
effective july   fnma  historically the association s primary loan investor  implemented certain loan origination requirement changes affecting loan eligibility that  prior to may  we did not adopt 
subsequent to the may implementation date of our revised loan origination procedures  and upon review and validation by fnma which was received on november   we expect that those fixed rate  first mortgage loans that are originated under the revised procedures  will thereafter be eligible for securitization and sale in fnma mortgage backed security form 
previously  our decision not to implement the changes necessary to comply with fnma s revised requirements  was based on our consideration that since  the association  employing only non commissioned loan originators and utilizing a centralized underwriting process  had sold loans to fnma under a series of proprietary variances  or contractual waivers  that were negotiated between us and fnma during the term of our relationship 
those proprietary concessions related to certain loan file documentation and quality control procedures the lack of which  in our opinion  did not diminish in any way the excellent credit quality of the loans that we 
table of contents delivered to fnma  but facilitated the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and the quality and value of the loan products that we were able to offer to our borrowers 
the high credit quality of the loans that we delivered to fnma was consistently evidenced by the superior delinquency profile of our portfolio in peer performance comparisons prepared by fnma throughout the term of our relationship 
in response to the housing crisis that commenced in  and with the objective of improving the credit profile of its overall loan portfolio  fnma enacted many credit tightening measures  culminating in the effective elimination of proprietary variances and waivers  accompanied by the imposition of additional file documentation requirements and expanded quality control procedures 
in addition to substantively changing fnma s operating procedures  effects of the housing crisis spread throughout the secondary residential mortgage market and resulted in a significantly altered operating framework for all secondary market participants 
we believed that this dramatically altered operating framework offered opportunities for business process innovators to create new secondary market solutions especially as such opportunities would be expected to target high credit quality residential loans similar to those that we have traditionally originated 
during the fiscal year ended september   million of non agency eligible  fixed rate mortgage loans were sold on a servicing retained basis to a private investor 
during the fiscal year ended september   no loan sales to private investors were completed  and at september   there were no loan sale commitments to private investors outstanding 
as reported above  during the fiscal year ended september   million of non agency eligible  whole loan sales  all on a servicing retained basis  were completed 
at september   there were no non agency eligible  whole loans classified as mortgage loans held for sale  nor were any loans sale commitments outstanding with respect to such loans 
while we have been successful in completing several non agency backed whole loan sales during the fiscal year ended september   in our opinion  the breadth of  and the transaction pricing in  the non agency market has not developed in the manner  or with the speed that we believe justified the continuing delay in our adoption of fnma loan origination requirements 
accordingly  while we continue to evaluate available opportunities in the secondary market  we have developed a parallel operation that fully complies with current fnma loan eligibility standards 
in that regard  during the quarter ended june   the association implemented procedures necessary for participation in fnma harp ii home affordable refinance program initiative 
included in the balance of mortgage loans held for sale at september  and september   were million and million  respectively  of agency compliant harp ii loans 
harp ii loan sales during the fiscal years ended september  and september   totaled million and million  respectively 
at september  and september   outstanding harp ii loan sales commitments totaled million and million  respectively 
at september  and september   mortgage loans held for sale  all of which were long term  fixed rate first mortgage loans  totaled million and million  respectively  and were comprised of the following components september  september  dollars in thousands loans held for sale held for sales to private investors held for sales to fnma total in response to the changes made in fnma loan eligibility requirements  in july we began marketing an adjustable rate mortgage loan product that provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to a long term  fixed rate mortgage 
since its introduction  the smart rate adjustable rate mortgage has offered borrowers an interest rate lower than that of a fixed rate loan 
the rate is locked for three or five years then resets annually after that 
it contains a feature to re lock the rate an unlimited number of times at our then  current rate and fee schedule  for another three or five years dependent on the original reset period without having to complete a full refinance transaction 
re lock eligibility is subject to a satisfactory payment performance history by the borrower never days late  no day delinquencies during the last twelve months  current at the time of re lock  and no foreclosures or bankruptcies since the smart rate application was taken 
in addition to a satisfactory payment history  re lock eligibility requires that the property continues to be the borrower s primary residence 
the loan term cannot be extended in connection with a re lock nor can new funds be advanced 
all interest rate caps and floors remain as originated 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  adjustable rate mortgage loan originations totaled million and billion  respectively  while during the same time periods  fixed rate mortgage loan originations totaled billion and billion  respectively 
by comparison  during the nine months ended june   the last nine months of operations prior to the introduction of our smart rate product  adjustable rate mortgage loan originations totaled million while fixed rate originations totaled billion 
the amount of origination volumes  including refinancings by our existing customers  along with the portion of that activity that pertains to loans that we previously sold but for which we retained the right to provide mortgage servicing so as to maintain our relationship with our customer 
table of contents when coupled with the level of loan sales  if any  determines the balance of loans held on our balance sheet 
the amount of adjustable rate loan activity described above resulted in billion of long term adjustable rate loans in our residential mortgage loans held for investment portfolio at september   as compared to billion at september  at september   the amount of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans represented of the total residential mortgage loans held for investment portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loan activity described above resulted in billion of long term fixed rate loans in our residential mortgage loans held for investment portfolio  as compared to billion at september  the september  and september  measurements exclude million  and million  respectively  of long term  fixed rate loans reported as mortgage loans held for sale 
no long term  adjustable rate loans were designated as mortgage loans held for sale at either of these reported measurement dates 
in addition to actively marketing our smart rate product  beginning in the latter portion of fiscal  we also began to feature our ten year  fully amortizing fixed rate first mortgage loan in our product promotions 
the ten year  fixed rate loan has a less severe interest rate risk profile when compared to loans with fixed rate terms of to years and helps us to more effectively manage our interest rate risk exposure  yet provides our borrowers with the certainty of a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the obligation 
during the fiscal year ended september   ten year fixed rate first mortgage loan originations totaled million  or of our fixed rate originations and of our total originations 
in the past  we have also managed interest rate risk by promoting home equity lines of credit  which have a variable interest rate 
as described below  this product carries an incremental credit risk component and has been adversely impacted by the housing market downturn 
between june  and march   due to the deterioration in overall housing conditions including concerns for loans and lines in a second lien position  home equity lines of credit and home equity loans were not offered by the association 
beginning in march   the association offered redesigned home equity lines of credit to qualifying existing home equity customers  subject to certain property and credit performance conditions 
in february the association further modified the product design and the terms included monthly principal and interest payments throughout the entire term 
in april we extended the offer to both existing home equity customers and new consumers in ohio  florida and selected counties in kentucky 
these offers were  and are  subject to certain property and credit performance conditions which include lower cltv maximum ratios in ohio kentucky and in florida  for programs in place prior to the cltv extended to as high as limited geographic offering only ohio  kentucky and florida  programs in place prior to were offered nationwide  borrower income is fully verified in prior programs income was not always fully verified  beginning in february  borrowers are qualified using a principal and interest payment based on the interest rate offered to the borrower  plus  amortized over years  for applications taken between march and february  borrowers were qualified using a principal and interest payment based on the interest rate offered to the borrower plus  amortized over years for programs in place prior to  borrowers were qualified using only the interest rate offered to the borrower  the minimum credit score to qualify for the re introduced home equity line of credit is in ohio and kentucky and in florida our prior home equity line of credit offering in required a minimum credit score of in all markets  and beginning in february  the term for new home equity line of credit applications is a five year draw period  during which monthly principal and interest payments are made based on the portion of the original term of years that remains  followed by a year repayment only period  during which payments will be comprised of both principal and interest  for applications taken between march and february  the term for new home equity line of credit applications was a five year draw period during which interest only payments are made  followed by a year repayment period  during which payments are comprised of both principal and interest for programs in place prior to  terms generally offered a year draw period  with interest only payments  followed by a year repayment period  with payment of principal and interest 
the existing home equity lines of credit portfolio  with a principal balance of billion at september   favorably impacts our interest rate risk profile 
the efforts described above are intended to prudently stem the portfolio attrition reduction that has been experienced during the last three years and to ultimately re establish home equity line of credit lending as a meaningful strategy used to manage our interest rate risk profile 

table of contents should a rapid and substantial increase occur in general market interest rates  it is probable that  prospectively and particularly over a multi year time horizon  the level of our net interest income would be adversely impacted 
monitoring and limiting our credit risk 
while  historically  we had been successful in limiting our credit risk exposure by generally imposing high credit standards with respect to lending  the confluence of unfavorable regional and macro economic events since  coupled with our pre expanded participation in the second lien mortgage lending markets  has significantly refocused our attention with respect to credit risk 
in response to the evolving economic landscape  we have continuously revised and updated our quarterly analysis and evaluation procedures  as needed  for each category of our lending with the objective of identifying and recognizing all appropriate credit impairments 
at september   of our assets consisted of residential real estate loans both held for sale and held for investment and home equity loans and lines of credit  the overwhelming majority of which were originated to borrowers in the states of ohio and florida 
our analytic procedures and evaluations include specific reviews of all home equity loans and lines of credit that become or more days past due  as well as specific reviews of all first mortgage loans that become or more days past due 
we also expanded our analysis of current performing home equity lines of credit to better mitigate future risk of loss 
in accordance with regulatory guidance issued in january  performing home equity lines of credit subordinate to first mortgages delinquent greater than days are transferred to non accrual status 
at september   the recorded investment of such performing home equity lines of credit  not otherwise classified as non accrual  was million 
also  the occ issued guidance in july that requires loans  where at least one borrower has been discharged of their obligation in chapter bankruptcy  to be classified as troubled debt restructurings 
also required pursuant to this guidance is the charge off of performing loans to collateral value and non accrual classification when all borrowers have had their obligations discharged in chapter bankruptcy  regardless of how long the loans have been performing 
at september   million of loans in chapter bankruptcy status were included in total troubled debt restructurings 
at september   the recorded investment in non accrual status loans included million of performing loans in chapter bankruptcy status where at least one borrower had been discharged of their obligation 
based on occ interpretive guidance  million of net charge offs related to those loans were recognized during the fiscal quarter ended september  in response to the unfavorable regional and macro economic environment that arose beginning in  and in an effort to limit our credit risk exposure and improve the credit performance of new customers  we have tightened our credit criteria in evaluating a borrower s ability to successfully fulfill his or her repayment obligation and we have revised the design of many of our loan products to require higher borrower down payments  limited the products available for condominiums  and eliminated certain product features such as interest only adjustable rate loans  loans above certain loan to value ratios  and prior to march  home equity lending products with the exception of bridge loans 
prior to its july  merger into the occ  the ots issued  effective february   memoranda of understanding covering the association  third federal savings  mhc and the company 
on december   the association primary regulator terminated the mou applicable to the association 
however  the mou applicable to third federal savings  mhc and the company  which  since july   has been enforced by the frs  has not been terminated 
the items in the mou applicable to third federal savings  mhc and the company pertain to any plans for new debt  dividends or stock repurchases and the further refinement and enhancement of our enterprise risk management processes 
specifically  the company is required to submit a written request for non objection to the frs at least days prior to the anticipated date of any proposed debt  dividend or capital distribution eg stock repurchase transactions and without the receipt of a written non objection from the frs  is prohibited from consummating any such proposed transaction 
on september   the company announced that it had received the frs written non objection to the resumption of its fourth stock repurchase plan that  at that time  had  shares of its outstanding common stock remaining to be purchased under the terms of the plan 
repurchases began on october  the requirements of the mou carry costs to complete which has increased our non interest expense 
although the company has received a written non objection with respect to its fourth stock repurchase plan and is diligently working with the frs to resolve the remaining concerns so that the company can extend its stock repurchase program and can initiate the process required to pay a dividend  such actions remain subject to receipt of the frs written non objection as specified in the mou  until the remaining concerns of our regulator are resolved 
the requirements of the mou which are applicable to the company and third federal savings  mhc will remain in effect until our regulator decides to terminate  suspend or modify them 
one aspect of our credit risk concern relates to the high percentage of our loans that are secured by residential real estate in the states of ohio and florida  particularly in light of the difficulties that have arisen with respect to the real estate markets in those states 
at september   approximately and of the combined total of our residential  non home today and construction loans held for investment were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
our or more days delinquency ratios on those loans in ohio and florida at september  were and  respectively 
our or more days delinquency ratio for the non home today portfolio as a whole was 
also  at september   approximately and of our home equity loans and lines of credit were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
our days or more delinquency ratios on those loans in ohio and florida at september  were and 
table of contents  respectively 
our or more days delinquency ratio for the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio as a whole was 
while we focus our attention on  and are concerned with respect to the resolution of  all loan delinquencies  our highest concern is centered on loans that are secured by properties in florida 
the allowance for loan losses portion of the preceding part i  item  business section provides extensive details regarding our loan portfolio composition  delinquency statistics  our methodology in evaluating our loan loss provisions and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
in spite of recent improving credit metrics  as long as unemployment levels remain high  particularly in ohio and florida  and florida housing values remain depressed  due to prior overbuilding and speculation which has resulted in considerable inventory on the market  we expect that we will continue to experience elevated levels of delinquencies and risk of loss 
our residential home today loans are another area of credit risk concern 
although the recorded investment in these loans totaled million at september   and constituted only of our total held for investment loan portfolio balance  these loans comprised and of our days or greater delinquencies and our total delinquencies  respectively 
at september   approximately and of our residential  home today loans were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
at september   the percentages of those loans delinquent days or more in ohio and florida were and  respectively 
the disparity between the portfolio composition ratio and delinquency composition ratio reflects the nature of the home today loans 
we do not offer  and have not offered  loan products frequently considered to be designed to target sub prime borrowers containing features such as higher fees or higher rates  negative amortization  or low initial payment features with adjustable interest rates 
our home today loans  the majority of which were entered into with borrowers that had credit profiles that would not have otherwise qualified for our loan products due to deficient credit scores  generally contained the same features as loans offered to our non home today borrowers 
the overriding objective of our home today lending  just as it is with our non home today lending  was to create successful homeowners 
we have attempted to manage our home today credit risk by requiring that borrowers attend pre and post borrowing financial management education and counseling and that the borrowers be referred to us by a sponsoring organization with which we have partnered 
further  to manage the credit aspect of these loans  inasmuch as the majority of these buyers do not have sufficient funds for required down payments  many loans include private mortgage insurance 
at september   of home today loans included private mortgage insurance coverage 
from a peak recorded investment of million at december   the total recorded investment of the home today portfolio has declined to million at september  this trend generally reflects the evolving conditions in the mortgage real estate market and the tightening of standards imposed by issuers of private mortgage insurance 
as part of our effort to manage credit risk  effective march   the home today underwriting guidelines were revised to be substantially the same as our traditional mortgage product 
at september   the recorded investment in home today loans originated subsequent to march  was million 
unless and until lending standards and private mortgage insurance requirements loosen  we expect the home today portfolio to continue to decline in balance 
maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources 
for most insured depositories  customer and community confidence are critical to their ability to maintain access to adequate liquidity and to conduct business in an orderly fashion 
the company believes that maintaining high levels of capital is one of the most important factors in nurturing customer and community confidence 
accordingly  we have managed the pace of our growth in a manner that reflects our emphasis on high capital levels 
at september   the association s ratio of core capital to adjusted tangible assets a basic industry measure under which is deemed to represent a well capitalized status was 
we expect to continue to remain a well capitalized institution 
in managing its level of liquidity  the company monitors available funding sources  which include attracting new deposits  borrowing from others  the conversion of assets to cash and the generation of funds through profitable operations 
the company has traditionally relied on retail deposits as its primary means in meeting its funding needs 
at september   deposits totaled billion  while borrowings totaled million and borrowers advances and servicing escrows totaled million  combined 
in evaluating funding sources  we consider many factors  including cost  duration  current availability  expected sustainability  impact on operations and capital levels 
to attract deposits  we offer our customers attractive rates of return on our deposit products 
our deposit products typically offer rates that are highly competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other financial institutions 
we intend to continue this practice 
we preserve the availability of alternative funding sources through various mechanisms 
first  by maintaining high capital levels  we retain the flexibility to increase our balance sheet size without jeopardizing our capital adequacy 
effectively  this permits us to increase the rates that we offer on our deposit products thereby attracting more potential customers 
second  we pledge available real estate mortgage loans and investment securities with the fhlb of cincinnati and the federal reserve bank of cleveland frb cleveland 
at september  these collateral pledge support arrangements provide the ability to immediately borrow an additional million from the fhlb of cincinnati and million from the frb cleveland discount window 
from the perspective of collateral value securing fhlb of cincinnati advances  our capacity limit for 
table of contents additional borrowings beyond the immediately available limits at september  was billion  subject to satisfaction of the fhlb of cincinnati common stock ownership requirement 
to satisfy the common stock ownership requirement we would need to increase our ownership of fhlb of cincinnati common stock by an additional million 
third  we invest in high quality marketable securities that exhibit limited market price variability  and to the extent that they are not needed as collateral for borrowings  can be sold in the institutional market and converted to cash 
at september   our investment securities portfolio totaled million 
finally  cash flows from operating activities have been a regular source of funds 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  cash flows from operations totaled million and million  respectively 
historically  a portion of the residential first mortgage loans that we originated were considered to be highly liquid as they were eligible for delivery sale to fnma 
however  due to delivery requirement changes imposed by fnma  effective july   this is not currently a viable channel of available liquidity 
refer to controlling our interest rate risk exposure for additional details 
at september   million of agency eligible  long term  fixed rate loans were classified as held for sale 
during the fiscal year ended september   million of agency compliant harp ii loans were sold and a total of million of long term  fixed rate and adjustable rate first mortgage loans were sold to four private investors in separate transactions 
we have implemented loan origination changes  which upon review and approval by fnma  which was received on november   will allow a portion of our future first mortgage loan originations to be eligible for securitization and sale in fnma mortgage backed security form 
overall  while customer and community confidence can never be assured  the company believes that our liquidity is adequate and that we have adequate access to alternative funding sources 
monitoring and controlling operating expenses 
we continue to focus on managing operating expenses 
our ratio of non interest expense to average assets was for the fiscal year ended september  and for the fiscal year ended september  as of september   our average assets per full time employee and our average deposits per full time employee were million and million  respectively 
we believe that each of these measures compares favorably with the averages for our peer group 
our average deposits held at our branch offices million per branch office as of september  contribute to our expense management efforts by limiting the overhead costs of serving our deposit customers 
we will continue our efforts to control operating expenses as we grow our business 
in november  the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured institutions to pay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of calendar and to also prepay their estimated risk based assessments for all of the calendar years  and our required prepayment was million 
the remaining prepayment held by the fdic was refunded in june  as more fully described in part i item business supervision and regulation federal banking regulation insurance of deposit accounts the dfa required the fdic to revise its assessment system to base it on each institution s total assets less tangible capital instead of deposits 
while the assessment base increased for all institutions  including the association  changes pursuant to the dfa requirement resulted in a increase in the association assessment base which was more than offset by a reduction in the association s assessment rate during the quarter immediately prior to the change when compared to the quarter immediately following the change  which was effective april  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operations depend  and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments  are our policies with respect to our allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights  income taxes  pension benefits and stock based compensation 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the amount of the allowance is based on significant estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions used and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
at september   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance would result in a million charge or credit  respectively  to income before income taxes 

table of contents as a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the charge offs for specific loans 
assumptions are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
management carefully reviews the assumptions supporting such appraisals to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
historically  the evaluation has been comprised of a specific component and a general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as a problem loan through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan 
through september   svas were established as required by this analysis and charge offs  when necessary  were recorded when the loan was resolved through deed in lieu  foreclosure or short sales 
in september  a portion of the sva was reclassified as iva 
this portion represented the allowance on individually reviewed loans dependent on cash flows  such as performing tdrs  and a portion of the allowance on loans that represented further deterioration in the fair value not supported by an appraisal 
during the quarter ended december   the sva exclusive of the reclassified iva was charged off 
refer to the allowance for loan losses section in part i  item  business third federal savings and loan association of cleveland lending activities  for additional details 
the general component of the evaluation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we also analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic concentrations 
quantitative loss factors used in determining an appropriate allowance level are supplemented by more qualitative factors that impact potential losses 
qualitative factors include various market conditions  such as collateral values and unemployment rates 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
during the quarter ended december   a one time charge off of svas  which was million at september   was recorded by the company in connection with the adoption of the occ prescribed methodology regarding loan impairments 
refer to the allowance for loan losses section in part i  item  business third federal savings and loan association of cleveland lending activities  for additional details 
additionally  effective september   pursuant to occ issued guidance  million of performing loans  where all borrowers have been discharged of their obligation through chapter bankruptcy procedures  were charged off 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights represent the present value of the estimated future net servicing fees expected to be received pursuant to the right to service loans that are in our loan servicing portfolio but are owned by others 
mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets for both purchased rights and for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
the most critical accounting policy associated with mortgage servicing is the methodology used to determine the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
a number of estimates affect the capitalized value and include the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption  the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans  and the discount factor used to compute the present value of the mortgage servicing right 
the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption is significantly affected by interest rates 
in general  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage loans prepay faster and the value of our mortgage servicing assets decreases 
conversely  during periods of rising rates  the value of mortgage servicing rights generally increases due to slower rates of prepayments 
the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans is deducted from the retained servicing fee gross mortgage loan interest rate less amounts remitted to third parties investor pass through rate  guarantee fee  mortgage insurance fee  etc 
to determine the net servicing fee for purposes of capitalization computations 
to the extent that prospective actual costs incurred to service the mortgage loans differ from the estimate  our future results will be adversely or favorably impacted 
the discount factor selected to compute the present value of the servicing right reflects expected marketplace yield requirements 

table of contents the amount and timing of mortgage servicing rights amortization is adjusted monthly based on actual results 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a valuation review of mortgage servicing rights for potential decreases in value 
this quarterly valuation review entails applying current assumptions to the portfolio classified by interest rates and  secondarily  by prepayment characteristics 
at september   the capitalized value of our right to service billion of loans for others was million  or of the serviced loan portfolio  and was based on an estimated weighted average life of years 
activity in the balance of mortgage servicing rights is summarized as follows year ended september  mortgage valuation servicing asset allowance net balance beginning of period additions from loan securitizations sales amortization net change in valuation allowance balance end of period fair value of capitalized amounts year ended september  mortgage valuation servicing asset allowance net balance beginning of period additions from loan securitizations sales amortization net change in valuation allowance balance end of period fair value of capitalized amounts year ended september  mortgage valuation servicing asset allowance net balance beginning of period additions from loan securitizations sales amortization net change in valuation allowance balance end of period fair value of capitalized amounts 
table of contents at september   substantially all of the approximately  loans serviced for fnma and others were performing in accordance with their contractual terms and management believes that it has no material repurchase obligations associated with these loans 
the following tables summarize our repurchases and loss reimbursements to investors  charges related to default servicing non compliance and compensatory fees incurred during the indicated periods 
all transactions were related to loans serviced for fnma 
there were no material repurchase or loss reimbursement requests outstanding at september  an accrual for million has been established for probable losses 
on november   the association entered into a resolution agreement with fnma pursuant to which  on november   the association remitted million to fnma 
the remittance amount included million related to outstanding mortgage insurance claim payments on loans 
under the terms of the resolution agreement  fnma withdrew all outstanding repurchase and make whole demands and generally waived its right to enforce future repurchase obligations with respect to all mortgage loans approximately  active loans or loans with a remaining balance that were originated by the association between january  and december  and delivered to fnma prior to january  the association believes that by entering into this resolution agreement  a potentially large uncertainty with respect to future performance has been substantially reduced 
for the fiscal years ended september  number of loans balance losses or charges incurred number of loans balance losses or charges incurred number of loans balance losses or charges incurred dollars in thousands repurchased loans non recourse  non performing loans recourse  non performing loans non recourse  performing loans post disposition file reviews compensatory fees related to default servicing repurchases of non recourse  non performing loans were generally attributed to underwriting primarily debt to income ratio non compliance 
at september  the association serviced loans with a principal balance of million for fnma that were subject to recourse 
of these  seven loans with principal balances that totaled thousand were delinquent days or more 
all other loans serviced for others were sold without recourse 
repurchases of non recourse  performing loans were the result of post sales file reviews that identified underwriting primarily debt to income ratio non compliance 
post disposition file reviews resulted in losses or charges when loans which had been sold to fnma failed to perform  the underlying collateral was sold  a loss was incurred  and a post disposition file review identified underwriting primarily debt to income ratio non compliance 
compensatory fees related to default servicing represented instances in which the association default servicing procedures did not comply with fnma servicing requirements 
income taxes 
we consider accounting for income taxes a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
we use the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we must assess the realization of the deferred tax asset and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease exisiting valuation allowances  if any  are charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
at september   no valuation allowances were outstanding and even though we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for deferred tax assets at september   there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in the future 
pension benefits 
the determination of our obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may 
table of contents fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions could materially affect future pension obligations and expense 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the cost of associate and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
we estimate the per share value of option grants using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties  and therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the per share value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction from changes in expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets decreased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  this decrease was mainly the result of the combination of loan sales  principal repayments and net charge offs exceeding new loan origination levels  partially offset by an increase in investment securities 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   as our most liquid assets have been reinvested into investment securities and have been used to fund reductions in the balance of deposits 
investment securities increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  there were no sales of investment securities during the fiscal year ended september  as million in purchases of investment securities were substantially offset by million in principal paydowns and million of net acquisition premium amortization which occurred in the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
differences between the cost and fair value for investment securities held in the available for sale portfolio decreased the balance of investment securities by million during the fiscal year 
mortgage loans held for sale decreased million to million at september  from million at september  during the year ended september   loan sales of million were completed  consisting of million of fixed rate loans that qualified under fnma harp ii  million of fixed rate  non agency eligible whole loans to private investors  and million of adjustable rate  non agency eligible whole loans to a private investor 
during the year ended september  there were million of loans transferred from the held for investment portfolio to the held for sale portfolio 
during the same period there were million of loans transferred from the held for sale portfolio to the the held for investment portfolio 
the balance of mortgage loans held for sale at september   was comprised solely and entirely of agency compliant harp ii loans 
loans held for investment  net  decreased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the decrease was mainly a result of the decrease in the home equity loan and line of credit portfolio 
residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to billion during the year ended september  from billion at september  as new originations exceeded principal repayments  loan sales and net charge offs 
the increase in residential mortgage loans includes the negative impact of million in net charge offs from both home today and non home today loans during the year ended september  the total allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to million from million at september  during the year ended september   million of three and five year smartrate loans were originated while billion of   and year fixed rate first mortgage loans were originated 
these fixed rate originations were offset by paydowns and fixed rate loan sales which resulted in a decrease in the balance of owned fixed rate  first mortgage loans during the current fiscal year 
historically  the preponderance of our new loan originations was comprised of fixed rate loans which were frequently offset by fixed rate loan sales 
loan sales of million  including million which were fixed rate  were recorded in the year ended september  of the total loan sales in the current fiscal year  million  including million which were fixed rate  were sales of non agency eligible loans  which reflected the impact of changes imposed by fnma  the association s primary loan investor  related to requirements for loans that it accepts  as well as the strategy of originating adjustable rate loans to be held for investment on our balance sheet 
refer to the controlling our interest rate risk exposure 
table of contents section of the overview for additional discussion regarding our management of interest rate risk 
the increase in residential mortgage loans was offset by a million decrease in home equity loans and lines of credit 
between june  and march   we suspended the acceptance of new home equity loan and line of credit applications with the exception of bridge loans 
beginning in march   we offered redesigned home equity lines of credit to qualifying existing home equity customers  subject to certain property and credit performance conditions 
in february we further modified the product design and in april we extended the offer to both existing home equity customers and new consumers in ohio  florida and selected counties in kentucky 
at september   the recorded investment related to home equity lines of credit originated subsequent to march   totaled million 
at september   pending commitments to extend new home equity lines of credit to our existing customers totaled million

mortgage loan servicing assets  net  decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  this net change reflects the reduced level  as compared to pre levels  of loan sales  and accompanying creation of new mortgage loan servicing assets  that resulted from the delivery requirement changes imposed by fnma as described in maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources above 
for the fiscal year ended september  mortgage loan servicing asset amortization totaled million while asset generation from million in new sales totaled million 
the majority of the amortization is linked to normal curtailments and paydowns and to a lesser extent the low level of mortgage interest rates that prompt refinance activity by borrowers 
the principal balance of loans serviced decreased million  or  during the year ended september  to billion from billion at september  prepaid expenses and other assets decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  this change was primarily the result of normal amortization and the subsequent refund of the remaining prepaid fdic insurance  which had a balance of million at september  the deferred tax asset decreased million  primarily due to the release of loan loss reserves 
deposits decreased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the decrease in deposits was the result of a million decrease in our certificates of deposit cds partially offset by a million increase in our high yield savings accounts a subcategory of our savings accounts and a million increase in our high yield checking accounts a subcategory of our negotiable order of withdrawal accounts during the fiscal year ended september  to manage our cost of funds  maturing  higher rate cds were replaced by other lower rate savings products or borrowed funds from the fhlb  as needed 
we believe that our high yield savings accounts as well as our high yield checking accounts provide a stable source of funds 
in addition  our high yield savings accounts are expected to reprice in a manner similar to our equity loan products  and  therefore  assist us in managing interest rate risk 
the balance of certificates of deposits at september  includes million in brokered certificates of deposits 
there were no brokered cds at september  borrowed funds increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   which helped offset some of the deposit reduction 
the increase was comprised of a million net increase in longer term borrowings mainly four to six year advances partially offset by a million decrease in lower cost  short term overnight borrowings from the fhlb of cincinnati 
we decreased short term advances due to increased loans sales and decreased cash demands 
principal  interest  and related escrow owed on loans serviced decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  principal and interest collected decreased million along with a million decrease in retained tax payments collected from borrowers in the current period 
this decrease reflects the impact of a lower balance in the sold loan portfolio as normal curtailments and paydowns exceeded loan sales and the cyclical timing of real estate tax payments that have been collected from borrowers and remitted to various taxing agencies 
shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  activity reflects million of net income in the fiscal year combined with million of adjustments related to the allocation of shares of our common stock related to awards under the stock based compensation plan and the esop  a million increase from the actuarially determined balance of our pension obligation and a million after tax unrealized loss on available for sale investment securities 

table of contents analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the income we earn on our interest earning assets and the expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities

interest income 
gross interest income decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from decreases in interest income from loans and mortgage backed securities 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased million  or  to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year as interest rates on adjustable rate securities that collateralize certain mortgage backed securities reset to lower current rates and higher  fixed rate securities that collateralize other mortgage backed securities continued to experience accelerated paydowns and were replaced by securities that provided lower yields 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities increased million to million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the million in principal paydowns and maturities which occurred in the current fiscal year were more than offset by million in purchases 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during fiscal year interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the yield to from as historically low interest rates have kept the amount of refinance activity high  or approximately of total originations 
during the current fiscal year million  or of the total originations  were smart rate adjustable rate first mortgage loans which were originated at interest rates below rates offered on fixed rate products  and which contributed to the lower average yield 
the decrease in interest income on loans during fiscal was combined with a million decrease in the average balance of loans to billion for fiscal compared to billion for the prior fiscal year as repayments and loan sales exceeded new loan production 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the change resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit combined with modest decreases in interest expense on now accounts and savings accounts 
interest expense on cds decreased million  or  to million compared to million for fiscal the change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on cds to from combined with a million  or  decrease in the average balance to billion from billion 
rates were adjusted on deposits in response to changes in general market rates as well as to changes in the rates paid by our competition on short term cds 
additionally  to optimally manage our funding costs during the current fiscal year  maturing  higher rate cds were replaced by other lower rate savings products or borrowed funds 
accordingly  interest expense on borrowed funds increased million  or  to million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
interest expense on savings accounts decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on savings accounts to from  partially offset by a million  or a  increase in the average balance to billion from billion for the prior fiscal year  reflecting customer preferences for savings accounts when rates are comparable to our short term certificates of deposit

provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the fiscal year ended september  and a provision of million for the fiscal year ended september  the current provision reflected improvement in our net charge off experience  and reduced levels of loan delinquencies  but was tempered by our awareness of the relative values of residential properties in comparison to their cyclical peaks as well as the uncertainty that persists in the current economic environment  which continues to challenge many of our loan customers 
the decreased level of net charge offs during the fiscal year  million as compared to million during the fiscal year ended september   was attributable to the elimination of the svas in the prior fiscal year  the chapter bankruptcy related charge offs in the prior fiscal year and improvement in credit quality in the current fiscal year 
as delinquencies in the portfolio have been resolved through pay off  short sale or foreclosure  or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan  uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses previously provided 
the net charge offs of million during the fiscal year ended september  exceeded the million loan loss provision recorded for the current fiscal year 
the loan loss provision of million recorded for the fiscal year ended september  was exceeded by net charge offs of million which included the occ mandated charge off of svas of million and million of occ mandated charge offs of performing loans discharged in chapter bankruptcy 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of the total recorded investment in loans receivable  at september   compared to million  or of the total recorded investment in loans receivable  at september  balances of recorded investments are net of deferred fees and any applicable loans in process 
the total recorded investment in non accrual loans decreased million during the fiscal year ended september  compared to a million decrease during the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in the prior fiscal year was largely impacted by the elimination of million of svas during the quarter ended december  in accordance with an occ directive

the non performing balances of home equity loans and lines of credit were million  or less than  of the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio at september  compared to million  also less than  at september  we believe we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate for fiscal years ended september  and refer to item business for additional discussion and disclosure related to our provisions for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year mainly as a result of net gain on the sale of loans 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in net loan servicing fees received in connection with the smaller portfolio of loans serviced for others 
loan fees and service charges decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this change is attributed to reduced loan servicing fees in the current fiscal year as the balance of our portfolio of sold loans that we are servicing for others has decreased from september  resulting in a million decrease in loan servicing fees collected in the current period compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in the portfolio of sold loans that we are servicing for others can be attributed to the increased paydowns in addition to the significantly lower volume of loan sales when compared to pre levels 
net gain on the sale of loans increased million  to million during the fiscal year ended september  from thousand the prior fiscal year as a result of million in loan sales during the current year as compared to million in the fiscal year ended september  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal when compared to million for fiscal  primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits and marketing expenses partially offset by decreases in federal insurance premiums  real estate owned expenses which includes associated legal and maintenance expenses partially offset by gains losses on the disposal of properties and other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year  reflecting normal annual salary merit and cost of living adjustments and increased bonus awards 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  the provision for fiscal included million of federal income tax provision and thousand of state income tax provision 
the provision for fiscal included million of federal income tax provision and thousand of state income tax provision 
our effective federal tax rate was during fiscal compared to during fiscal year our expected effective income tax rates are below the federal statutory rate because of our ownership of bank owned life insurance

interest income 
interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from decreases in interest income from loans and mortgage backed securities 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year as interest rates on adjustable rate securities reset to lower current rates and higher  fixed rate securities continue to experience accelerated paydowns 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities decreased million to million compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the million in principal paydowns and maturities which occurred during fiscal were more than offset by million in purchases 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during fiscal interest income on loans decreased million  or less than  to million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this change was attributed to a basis point decrease in the yield to from as historically low interest rates have increased the amount of refinance activity 
additionally  the increase in our smart rate adjustable rate first mortgage loan originations during fiscal at interest rates below rates offered on fixed rate products contributed to the lower average yield 
the decrease in interest income on loans during fiscal was partially offset by the million increase in the average balance of loans to billion during fiscal compared to billion in the prior fiscal year as new loan production exceeded repayments and loan sales 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year from million during the fiscal year 
the change resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit combined with modest decreases in interest expense on now accounts and savings accounts

as net interest income increased during fiscal  we experienced an improvement of our interest rate spread which increased basis points to compared to during the prior fiscal year 
our net interest margin increased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this increase can be partially attributed to the higher average loan balance during fiscal our average net interest earning assets decreased million  to billion during fiscal compared to billion during the prior fiscal year 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance 
continuing economic issues  including high levels of unemployment  are challenging our borrowers ability to repay their loans at a time when housing prices are weak  in part as a 
table of contents consequence of the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market  and make it difficult to sell their homes 
this limits the ability of many borrowers to self cure a delinquency 
based on our evaluation of the above factors  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the fiscal year ended september  and a provision of million during the fiscal year ended september  the increase in the provision is due to the impact of million of charge offs related to chapter bankruptcy status loans  as described below  which was partially offset by improved credit quality 
the increased level of net charge offs non sva and chapter related during fiscal  million as compared to million during the fiscal year ended september   resulted from increases in both the residential non home today and the residential home today portfolios and was partially offset by decreased charge offs non sva related in the home equity lending portfolio 
the increased charge off activity non sva related occurred despite continued improvement in delinquencies and was attributed partially to the baas interpretive guidance issued in july related to loans in chapter bankruptcy  which resulted in charge offs totaling million 
also  more delinquent loans moving into foreclosure and increased losses recognized based on declining sheriff sale appraisal amounts contributed to the increased charge offs for the year 
the fiscal provision reflects our net charge off experience  lower home values and the uncertain economic times  which continue to challenge many of our loan customers 
as delinquencies in the portfolio have been resolved through pay off  short sale or foreclosure  or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan  uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses previously provided 
the net charge offs non sva related  but inclusive of the chapter bankruptcy charge offs of million during the fiscal year ended september  were approximately the same as the million loan loss provision recorded for the fiscal year 
the loan loss provision of million recorded for the fiscal year ended september  exceeded net charge offs of million plus the increase in svas during that same fiscal year of million  note that changes in svas are considered to be the equivalent of a partial charge off 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of the total recorded investment in loans receivable  at september   compared to million  or of the total recorded investment in loans receivable at september  the million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflects the impact of the adoption  effective december   of an occ directive to discontinue the use of svas as discussed earlier 
the sva balance at september  was million 
of the million decrease in the recorded investment of non accrual loans from september to september  the largest decrease was in our residential home today portfolio  which decreased million  or to million 
the decrease in the balance of the residential home today loans during the fiscal year ended september  included million  related to the charge off of svas that was recorded effective december  as of september   the recorded investment in our home today portfolio was million  compared to million at september  the million balance in home today non accrual loans includes million in troubled debt restructurings which were current but included with non accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from their restructuring date 
the recorded investment in non accruing home equity loans and lines of credit decreased million  or  during the fiscal year ended september  during fiscal  net charge offs of million of uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses 
as of september   the recorded investment in our home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio was billion  compared to billion at september  we believe that non performing home equity loans and lines of credit are  on a relative basis  of greater concern than non home today loans as these home equity loans and lines of credits generally hold subordinated positions and accordingly  represent a higher level of risk 
the non performing balances of home equity loans and lines of credit were million or of the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio at september  compared to million or at september  in light of the depressed housing market in our primary geographic markets and the continued high level of delinquencies in our portfolio  we will continue to closely monitor the loss performance of this category

we believe we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate for fiscal years ended september  and refer to item business for additional discussion and disclosure related to our provisions for loan losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during the prior fiscal year primarily due lower to loan fees 

table of contents loan fees and service charges decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during prior fiscal year 
this change is attributed to reduced loan servicing fees during fiscal as the balance of our portfolio of sold loans we are servicing for others has decreased from september  resulting in a million decrease in loan servicing fees collected during fiscal compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in the portfolio of sold loans we are servicing for others can be attributed to the increased paydowns in addition to the significantly lower volume of loan sales 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year  primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits  other operating and marketing expenses partially offset by decreases in federal insurance premiums and appraisal and other loan review expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million during the current fiscal year compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
compensation costs increased million  reflecting normal annual salary merit adjustments coupled with full year impacts related to staff additions associated with enhanced risk management and account administration activities 
other variances in comparing our expenses for the fiscal year ended september  to those during the fiscal year ended september  included a million reduction in retirement costs as accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were frozen effective december   and a million increase in group health care expense 
for additional detail regarding the defined benefit plan  see the defined benefit plan section of note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
federal insurance premium and assessments decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
this change reflects the revision  as required pursuant to the dfa and as adopted effective april   in the deposit insurance assessment system that reoriented the determination of each institution s deposit insurance assessment so that it is based on total assets less tangible capital of the institution rather than solely on the balance of deposits 
our high level of tangible capital and minimal use of wholesale borrowings resulted in our reduced level of assessment 
appraisal and other loan review expenses decreased million  or  to million during during fiscal compared compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
these costs decreased during fiscal from an elevated level in the prior fiscal year when additional operating expenses legal  postage  courier  telephone  etc 
associated with our home equity lending reduction plan were incurred 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the increase is related to loss reimbursement expenses for loans serviced for fnma  which increased million in the current fiscal year to million  partially offset by decreases in various other expenses 
the increase in loss reimbursement expenses included million of actual loss reimbursements and the establishment of a reserve of million for probable losses 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million during fiscal compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the provision for fiscal included million of federal tax and thousand of state income tax expense 
the provision for the fiscal year ended september  included million of federal income tax provision and thousand of state income tax provision 
the state income tax provision is subtracted from income before income taxes when calculating the federal income tax provision 
our effective federal tax rate was during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the primary difference in the effective tax rate for fiscal when compared to the prior fiscal year is the adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our charitable contribution carryforward 
the valuation allowance was increased by thousand during the fiscal year ended september  and decreased by thousand during the fiscal year ended september  the charitable contribution carryforward expired september  our expected effective income tax rate is below the federal statutory rate primarily because of our ownership of bank owned life insurance 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the impact of bank owned life insurance and certain other adjustments on much lower pre tax earnings liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  borrowings from the frb cleveland discount window  principal repayments and maturities of securities and sales of loans 
as described below  the available liquidity from loan sales has decreased significantly from pre june levels 

table of contents in addition to the primary sources of funds described above  we have the ability to obtain funds through the use of collateralized borrowings in the wholesale markets  the use of brokered certificates of deposits and from sales of securities 
also  access to the equity capital markets via a supplemental minority stock offering or a full second step transaction remain as other potential sources of liquidity  although these channels generally require six to nine months of lead time 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the association s asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged investment securities for which ready markets exist  divided by total assets 
for the year ended september   our liquidity ratio averaged 
we believe that we had sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of september  we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million which represented a decrease of from september  the decrease can be attributed to maintaining less liquidity on the balance sheet as total assets have decreased 
investment securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at september  effective july   our traditional mortgage loan processing no longer complied with fnma s standard requirements and accordingly  since that date  our ability to meaningfully manage liquidity through the use of loan sales has been limited 
in response to this limitation and the accompanying interest rate risk management implications  the following steps were taken during the quarter ended june   the association implemented the procedures necessary for participation in fnma harp ii program  during the fiscal year ended september  the association negotiated several loan sales with private investors  and in may  the association adopted the loan origination process changes required by fnma that will be applied to a portion of its fixed rate loan originations and subsequent to the association reinstatement as an approved seller by fnma  which was received on november   enables the association to securitize and sell those loans that are originated using the fnma compliant procedures  in the secondary market 
during the year ended september   loan sales totaled million  which included million of loans that qualified under fnma harp ii initiative with the remainder comprised of high credit quality  long term  fixed rate and adjustable rate residential first mortgage loans  which were sold to private investors 
these non harp ii loans were not eligible for delivery to fnma 
at september   million of long term  fixed rate residential first mortgage loans were classified as held for sale  all of which qualified under fnma harp ii initiative 
there were million in loan sale commitments outstanding at september  our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had billion in undisbursed home equity lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled billion  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales  sales of investment securities  other deposit products  including new certificates of deposit  brokered certificates of deposit  fhlb advances  borrowings from the frb cleveland discount window or other collateralized borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
generally  we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 

table of contents our primary investing activities are originating residential mortgage loans and purchasing investments 
during the year ended september   we originated billion of residential mortgage loans  and during the year ended september   we originated billion of residential mortgage loans 
we purchased million of securities during the year ended september   and million during the year ended september  financing activities consist primarily of changes in deposit accounts  changes in the balances of principal and interest owed on loans serviced for others  fhlb advances and borrowings from the frb cleveland discount window 
we experienced a net decrease in total deposits of million during the year ended september  which reflected the active management of the offered rates on maturing  medium term four to six years cds  and compared to a net increase of million during the year ended september  when our offered rates were more attractively positioned in comparison to marketplace competition 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
principal and interest owed on loans serviced for others decreased million during the year ended september  compared to a net decrease of million during the year ended september  this change primarily reflected a decrease in the level of loan refinance activity between the two periods and was muted by the reduced size of the serviced loan portfolio 
during the year ended september  we increased our advances from the fhlb of cincinnati by million as we actively managed our liquidity ratio 
during the year ended september   our advances from the fhlb of cincinnati increased by million 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlb of cincinnati and the frb cleveland discount window  each of which provides an additional source of funds 
additionally  we may participate in the brokered certificates of deposit market 
at september  we had million of fhlb of cincinnati advances and no outstanding borrowings from the frb cleveland discount window 
additionally  at september  we had million of brokered certificates of deposit 
during the year ended september   we had average outstanding advances from the fhlb of cincinnati of million as compared to average outstanding advances of million during the year ended september  at september  we had the ability to immediately borrow an additional million from the fhlb of cincinnati and million from the frb cleveland discount window 
from the perspective of collateral value securing fhlb of cincinnati advances  our capacity limit for additional borrowings beyond the immediately available limits at september  was billion  subject to satisfaction of the fhlb of cincinnati common stock ownership requirement 
to satisfy the common stock ownership requirement we would have to increase our ownership of fhlb of cincinnati common stock by an additional million 
the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
in july  the occ and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their leverage and risk based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the basel committee on banking supervision and certain provisions of the dfa 
among other things  the rule establishes a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement of risk weighted assets  increases the minimum tier capital to risk based assets requirement from to of risk weighted assets and assigns a higher risk weight to exposures that are more than days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition  development or construction of real property 
the final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain available for sale securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one time opt in or opt out is exercised 
the rule limits a banking organization capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of of common equity tier capital to risk weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements 
the final rule becomes effective for the association on january  the capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning january  and ending january   when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective 
the final rule also implements consolidated capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies effective january  the weighted capital ratios pursuant to asset risk weightings as they are structured under the new rule differ unfavorably when compared to current computations 
the company estimated the impact of the new rule on reported risk weighted capital ratios to be immaterial 
at september   the association exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
the association is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 

table of contents the net proceeds from the stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal our financial condition and results of operations have been enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering  and have resulted in increased net interest earning assets and net interest income during the periods following completion of the offering in april however  due to the increase in equity that resulted from the net proceeds of our stock offering  our return on equity ratios have been adversely affected and can be expected to continue to be so affected prospectively 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we routinely enter into commitments to securitize and sell mortgage loans 
for additional information  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment  agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities and agreements with respect to investments 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total in thousands fhlb advances operating leases certificates of deposit private equity investments total commitments to extend credit includes accrued interest payable  computed on an actual days outstanding basis  at september  includes the unused portion including commitments for accounts suspended as a result of material default or a decline in equity of home equity lines of credit of billion 
the company provides mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans in its own portfolio  including home today loans  and loans in its servicing portfolio through contracts with two primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  the company absorbs mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a contractual limit  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premiums 
as of september   approximately million of mortgage loans in our portfolios were covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
at september   the maximum losses under the reinsurance contracts were limited to million 
the company has incurred million in losses under these reinsurance contracts and provided a liability for estimated losses totaling million as of september  management believes it has made adequate provision for estimated losses 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements pending as of september  in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update  comprehensive income topic  reporting of amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income which supersedes asu  comprehensive income topic  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
and the presentation requirements for reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu described below 
asu requires entities to present separately significant amounts reclassified out of each component of oci  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other significant amounts  entities shall provide cross references to the notes where additional details about the effect of the reclassifications are disclosed 
the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the only impact of these amendments on the company consolidated financial statements will be a change in the presentation of oci 
adopted in fiscal year ended september  fasb asu  presentation of comprehensive income eliminates the option to present oci in the statement of shareholders equity and provides an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of oci either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of oci along with a total for oci  and a total amount for comprehensive income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk has historically been interest rate risk 
in general  our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established risk parameter limits deemed appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives 
additionally  our board of directors has also authorized the formation of an asset liability management committee comprised of key operating personnel which is responsible for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines and risk limits approved by the board of directors 
further  the board has established the directors risk committee which conducts regular oversight and review of the guidelines  policies and deliberations of the asset liability management committee 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we have historically used the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i marketing adjustable rate and shorter maturity year  fixed rate mortgage loan products  
table of contents ii lengthening the weighted average remaining term of major funding sources  primarily by offering attractive interest rates on deposit products  particularly longer term certificates of deposit  and through the use of longer term advances from the fhlb of cincinnati and longer term brokered certificates of deposit  iii investing in shorter to medium term investments and mortgage backed securities  iv maintaining high levels of capital  and v securitizing and or selling long term  fixed rate residential real estate mortgage loans 
during the fiscal year ended september   million of long term  fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans were sold  all on a servicing retained basis  and  at september   million of long term  fixed rate residential first mortgage loans were classified as held for sale 
of the loan sales during the fiscal year  million was comprised of long term to years  fixed rate first mortgage loans which were sold to three private investors in separate transactions and million was comprised of long term all years  adjustable rate first mortgage loans which were sold to a fourth private investor 
additionally  we sold a total of million of long term to years  fixed rate first mortgage loans under fnma harp ii program 
at september   there were million of loan sales commitments outstanding 
effective july   fnma  historically the association s primary loan investor  implemented certain loan origination requirement changes affecting loan eligibility that  prior to may  we did not adopt 
subsequent to the may implementation date of our revised procedures  and  upon review and validation by fnma which was completed on november   we expect that those fixed rate  first mortgage loans primarily fixed rate  mortgage refinances with terms of years or more and harp ii loans that are originated under the revised procedures  will thereafter be eligible for securitization and sale in fnma mortgage backed security form 
we expect that certain loan types i 
e our smart rate adjustable rate loans  purchase fixed rate loans and ten year fixed rate loans will continue to be originated under our legacy procedures 
for loans originated prior to may and for those loans originated subsequent to april not originated under the revised fnma procedures  the association s ability to reduce interest rate risk via loan sales is limited to those loans that have established payment histories  strong borrower credit profiles and are supported by adequate collateral values that meet the requirements of private third party investors similar to the four transactions that were completed during fiscal in response to the evolving secondary market environment  since july  we have actively marketed an adjustable rate mortgage loan product and beginning in fiscal  have promoted a ten year fixed rate mortgage loan 
each of these products provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to longer term  fixed rate mortgage loans 
shortening the average maturity of our interest earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter term loans and investments  as well as loans and investments with variable rates of interest  helps to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases in market interest rates 
economic value of equity 
using customized modeling software  the association prepares periodic estimates of the amounts by which the net present value of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s economic value of equity would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach in measuring the interest rate sensitivity of eve 
the model estimates the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that instantaneous changes measured in basis points occur at all maturities along the united states treasury yield curve and other relevant market interest rates 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the model is tailored specifically to our organization  which  we believe  improves its accuracy 
the following table presents the estimated changes in the association s eve at september  that would result from the indicated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve and other relevant market interest rates 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of 
table of contents actual results 
change in interest rates basis points estimated eve estimated increase decrease in eve eve as a percentage of present value of assets eve ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
eve is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
eve ratio represents eve divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of an increase of basis points in all interest rates  the association would experience a decrease in eve 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the association would experience a increase in eve 
the following table is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the eve at a basis point rate of shock at september   with comparative information as of september  the association measures and manages its interest rate risk for interest rate shocks relative to established risk tolerances in eve 
at september  risk measure bp rate shock pre shock eve ratio post shock eve ratio sensitivity measure in basis points certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in measuring interest rate risk through changes in eve 
modeling changes in eve requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the eve tables presented above assume no new growth or business volumes  that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured  except for reductions to reflect mortgage loan principal repayments and prepayments  and that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the eve tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our eve and will differ from actual results 
we have previously reported that our former primary regulator  the ots  expressed concern with respect to several significant assumptions used in our prior internal interest rate risk model  as well as the reliability of the resulting irr profiles generated by that model 
while we believe that the previous irr model enabled us to efficiently  prudently and reasonably measure and manage irr  we nevertheless replaced that modeling system with a system that offers enhanced functionality and capabilities 
installation and implementation of the new irr modeling software was finalized during the quarter ended march  and  for periods subsequent to december   the irr disclosures as determined using the new model have been reported in our sec filings 
in connection with the installation and implementation of the new irr modeling 
table of contents software  factors related to prepayment  decay and default assumptions that impact the computation of eve were customized  based on the results of an independent  third party study that was prepared using the association data 
use of these customized assumptions further enhanced the alignment of our eve calculations with our risk profile 
during the fiscal year ended september   the prepayment  decay and default assumptions that impact the computation of eve were updated based on an expanded  independent  third party study of our customers behavioral patterns 
the customized irr model equations that were developed by our irr software vendor to reflect those updated customer behavioral patterns were further enhanced by the association based on the results of six months of performance backtesting 
the updated and enhanced behavioral equations were implemented and used to prepare irr estimates effective with the september  disclosures provided above and indicate an overall lower level of estimated irr 
the following table provides a comparison of irr estimates determined using our prior methodology  and irr estimates determined using our updated and enhanced modeling methodology  at the indicated dates estimated increase decrease in percent eve based on an increase in interest rates of basis points prior methodology enhanced methodology at march  at june  at september  as disclosed in prior filings 
as disclosed above 
as indicated in the preceding table  our updated and enhanced modeling methodology computes irr estimates that vary significantly from the estimates that we previously reported 
unfortunately  such can be the nature of modeling that attempts to predict group behavior in environments that have not occurred 
as we evaluated the differences in the models estimates  the most significant factor contributing to the dissimilarity in the results of the two methodologies was the prior model inability to capture the expected magnitude of customer mortgage loan repayments and prepayments levels 
based on the results of the updated customer behavioral studies and the inferences from our back testing  we have concluded that the updated and enhanced model methodology represents the most recent advancement in the evolution of our modeling capability and further represents our best estimates with respect to our irr profile and exposure 
in addition to our month end modeling reports that use current month end balances and current month end interest rates  we also compute eve using current month end balances and last month quarter interest rates in order to isolate the eve impact resulting purely from interest rate changes 
these results are then reviewed and discussed by management with appropriate actions taken if deemed necessary 
at september   the results were in line with management expectations 
the new model also possesses random patterning capabilities that our prior model lacked and accommodates extensive regression analytics applicable to the prepayment and decay profiles of our borrower and depositor portfolios 
we believe that the new model expands our ability to run alternative modeling scenarios and improves the timeliness of and our access to decision making data that is integral to our irr management processes 
modeling our irr profile and measuring our irr exposure are processes that are subject to continuous revision  refinement  modification  enhancement and validation 
we continually evaluate  challenge and update the methodology and assumptions used in our irr model 
changes to the methodology and or assumptions used in the model will result in reported irr profiles and reported irr exposures that will be different  and perhaps significantly  from the results reported above 
earnings at risk 
in addition to eve calculations  we use our simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates the institution s ear 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest that we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for prospective twelve and twenty four month periods using customized based on our portfolio characteristics assumptions with respect to loan prepayment rates  default rates and deposit decay rates  and the implied forward yield curve as of the market date for assumptions as to projected interest rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of instantaneous changes in market interest rates 
the simulation process is subject to continual enhancement  modification  refinement and adaptation in order that it might most accurately reflect our current circumstances  factors and expectations 
as of september   using our enhanced customer behavioral assumptions and reflective of other modeling modifications  we estimated that our ear for the months ending september  would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
the improvement in this estimated amount when compared to our september  estimated decrease of for the then ensuing month period  is reflective of the use of enhanced customer behavioral assumptions and other modeling modifications 
certain shortcomings are also inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in ear 
modeling changes in ear require making certain 
table of contents assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the interest rate risk information presented above assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains substantially constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 
in addition to the preparation of computations as described above  we also formulate simulations based on a variety of non linear changes in interest rates and a variety of non constant balance sheet composition scenarios 
the eve and ear analyses are similar in that they both start with the same month end balance sheet amounts  weighted average coupon and maturity 
the underlying prepayment  decay and default assumptions are also the same and they both start with the same month end markets treasury and libor yield curves  etc from that similar starting point  the models follow divergent paths 
eve is a stochastic model using different interest rate paths to compute market value at the cohorted transaction level for each of the categories on the balance sheet whereas ear uses the implied forward curve to compute interest income expense at the cohorted transaction level for each of the categories on the balance sheet 
eve is considered as a point in time calculation with a liquidation view of the association where all the cash flows including interest  principal and prepayments are modeled and discounted using discount factors derived from the current market yield curves 
it provides a long term view and helps to define changes in equity and duration as a result of changes in interest rates 
on the other hand  ear is based on balance sheet projections going one year and two year forward and assumes new business volume and pricing to calculate net interest income under different interest rate environments 
ear is calculated to determine the sensitivity of net interest income under different interest rate scenarios 
with each of these models specific policy limits have been established that are compared with the actual month end results 
these limits have been approved by the association board of directors and are used as benchmarks to evaluate and moderate interest rate risk 
in the event that there is a breach of policy limits  management is responsible for taking such action  similar to those described under the preceding heading of general  as may be necessary in order to return the association interest rate risk profile to a position that is in compliance with the policy 
at september  the irr profile as disclosed above did not breach our internal limits
