item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  and legal  regulatory  and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
earnings per share eps data is presented on a diluted basis 
financial results worldwide total revenue decreased percent to billion in  driven by steep sales declines for zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity in most major markets  partially offset by growth in certain other products 
net income and eps decreased percent to billion and  respectively  in compared with net income of billion and eps of in the decreases in net income and eps were due to the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa  partially offset by growth in certain other products and higher other income from the early payment of the exenatide revenue sharing obligation from amylin pharmaceuticals  inc amylin 
the following highlighted items affect comparisons of our and financial results collaborations note to the consolidated financial statements we recognized income of million pretax  or per share  related to the early payment of the exenatide revenue sharing obligation following the completion of amylin acquisition by bristol myers squibb bms 
asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges note to the consolidated financial statements we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  or per share  consisting of an intangible asset impairment related to liprotamase  restructuring charges related to initiatives to reduce our cost structure and global workforce  charges associated with the decision to stop development of a delivery device platform  and charges related to changes in returns reserve estimates for the withdrawal of xigris 
collaborations note to the consolidated financial statements we incurred acquired in process research and development ipr d charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim of million pretax  or per share 
asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges note to the consolidated financial statements we recognized charges of million pretax  or per share  primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 
we incurred a charge of million pretax  or per share  primarily for returned product and contractual commitments related to the withdrawal of xigris 
late stage pipeline our long term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we currently have approximately potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review  and a larger number of projects in preclinical research 
the following new molecular entities nmes are currently in phase iii clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described 
the quarter in which the nme initially entered phase iii for any indication is shown in parentheses baricitinib q a janus tyrosine kinase jak and jak inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in collaboration with incyte corporation dulaglutide q a long acting analog of glucagon like peptide for the treatment of type diabetes edivoxetine q a norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of major depression empagliflozin q a sodium glucose co transporter sglt inhibitor for the treatment of type diabetes in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim enzastaurin q a serine threonine kinase inhibitor that inhibits signaling within the protein kinase c beta pkc and pik akt pathways for the treatment of diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl evacetrapib q a cholesteryl ester transfer protein cetp inhibitor for the treatment of high risk vascular disease ixekizumab q a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to interleukin a il for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis necitumumab q an anti epidermal growth factor receptor egfr monoclonal antibody for the treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer nsclc new insulin glargine product q a new insulin glargine product for the treatment of type and type diabetes in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim novel basal insulin analog q a novel basal insulin for the treatment of type and type diabetes ramucirumab q an anti vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr monoclonal antibody for the treatment of metastatic breast  gastric  liver  nsclc  and colorectal cancers solanezumab q an anti amyloid beta a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of alzheimer s disease tabalumab q an anti b cell activating factor baff monoclonal antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus lupus 
biologic molecule subject to the us biologics price competition and innovation act the following nme has been submitted for regulatory review for potential use in the disease described 
the quarter the nme initially was submitted for any indication is shown in parenthesis liprotamase q a non porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
the following late stage pipeline developments have occurred since january  baricitinib in november  we initiated phase iii clinical trial testing 
dulaglutide in october  we announced positive top line results of three completed phase iii award trials award  award  and award studying dulaglutide as a once weekly treatment for type diabetes 
the primary efficacy endpoints  as measured by reduction in hemoglobin ac hbac at the mg dose  were met in all three studies 
having met the primary endpoints  superiority for hbac lowering was examined  and both doses of dulaglutide mg and mg demonstrated statistically superior reduction in hbac from baseline compared to exenatide twice daily injection at weeks award  metformin at weeks award  and sitagliptin at weeks award 
we anticipate filing for regulatory review in the us and europe in empagliflozin in january  we announced positive top line results for four completed phase iii clinical trials studying empagliflozin for treatment of patients with type diabetes 
in all four studies  the primary efficacy endpoint  defined as significant change in hbac from baseline compared to placebo  was met with empagliflozin and mg taken once daily 
the pivotal studies for empagliflozin completed in  and we and boehringer ingelheim anticipate filing for regulatory review in the us  europe  and japan in evacetrapib in october  we initiated phase iii clinical trial testing 
florbetapir on april   the fda approved amyvid florbetapir  a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for brain imaging of beta amyloid plaques in patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for alzheimer disease and other causes of cognitive decline 
in june  amyvid became available to a limited number of imaging centers 
in january  amyvid was also approved by the european commission  which has the authority to approve medicines for the european union 
ixekizumab in january  we initiated phase iii clinical trial testing for ixekizumab as a potential treatment for psoriatic arthritis 
liprotamase we continue to engage in discussions with the fda regarding future clinical trial requirements for liprotamase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
necitumumab we will assume sole worldwide development and commercialization rights to necitumumab following notice in the fourth quarter of from bms to terminate the collaboration for necitumumab in north america and japan 
novel basal insulin analog in january  we announced that we and boehringer ingelheim adjusted the scope of our collaboration  resulting in our reassuming the sole worldwide development and commercialization rights for the novel basal insulin analog 
we also announced plans for the and initiation of the remainder of the pre planned clinical trials for the molecule 
these studies will be conducted to support regulatory submissions and evaluate safety  efficacy  and differentiation of the molecule 
these studies are in addition to the five ongoing imagine clinical trials 
pomaglumetad methionil in august  we announced the decision to stop ongoing phase iii clinical studies investigating pomaglumetad methionil for the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia 
the decision was based on a lack of efficacy in two registration trials 
the decision was not based on any safety signals 
ramucirumab in october  we announced that the regard trial  a phase iii study of ramucirumab as a second line treatment in patients with metastatic gastric cancer  met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and its secondary endpoint of increased progression free survival 
we anticipate filing for regulatory review in the us and europe in solanezumab in august  we announced that the primary endpoints  both cognitive and functional  were not met in either of the two phase iii  double blind  placebo controlled expedition trials in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer disease 
however  a pre specified secondary analysis of pooled data across both trials showed a percent reduction of cognitive decline in patients with mild alzheimer disease 
we plan to conduct an additional phase iii study of solanezumab in patients with mild alzheimer disease 
enrollment is expected to begin no later than the third quarter of tabalumab in february  we announced our decision to discontinue the phase iii rheumatoid arthritis program for tabalumab due to lack of efficacy 
the decision was not based on safety concerns 
the tabalumab phase iii program for lupus is ongoing and will continue as planned 
there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development r d and the introduction of new products 
a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development 
the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take to years or longer and cost more than billion 
failure can occur at any point in the process  including late in the process after substantial investment 
as a result  most research programs will not generate financial returns 
new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success 
delays and uncertainties in the fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities 
consequently  it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 
we manage r d spending across our portfolio of molecules  and a delay in  or termination of  any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total r d spending 
due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the r d process  we cannot reliably estimate the nature  timing  completion dates  and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our r d projects  nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful r d project 
each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline  and none is individually material to our consolidated r d expense 
while we do accumulate certain r d costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes  we must make significant cost estimations and allocations  some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms 
therefore  we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total r d costs by project  by preclinical versus clinical spend  or by therapeutic category 
legal  regulatory  and other matters we will lose us patent protection for cymbalta in december and for evista in march see financial condition for additional information 
the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of brought significant changes to us health care 
these changes began to affect our financial results in and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future 
beginning in  pharmaceutical drug manufacturers provided a discount of percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage 
additionally  beginning in  a non tax deductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 
this fee is allocated to companies based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs 
we recognized million and million as marketing  selling  and administrative expense related to this fee  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the continuing prominence of us budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes  fees  rebates  or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies revenue or increase expenses may be enacted 
certain other federal and state health care proposals  including state price controls  continue to be debated  and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices 
these federal and state proposals  or state price pressures  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations 
proposals for cost containment measures are pending in a number of countries  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls  limit access to or reimbursement for our products  or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact  given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries 
the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of us based companies 
there also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which  and the rate at which  income of us companies would be taxed 
while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future  reform of us taxation  including taxation of international income  will continue to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration 
a significant change to the us tax system  including changes to the taxation of international income  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
operating results revenue our worldwide revenue for decreased percent  to billion  driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in most major markets  partially offset by growth in cymbalta  forteo  effient  alimta  and our animal health portfolio 
worldwide sales volume decreased percent and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed percent of revenue decline  partially offset by an increase of percent due to higher prices 
the decrease in volume was driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in most major markets  partially offset by volume gains for certain other products 
total revenue in the us decreased percent  to billion  due to the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa  partially offset by higher prices and increased demand for certain other products 
revenue outside the us decreased percent  to billion  driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for zyprexa in markets outside of japan  the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates  and lower prices  partially offset by increased demand for certain other products 
the following table summarizes our revenue activity in compared with year ended year ended december  december  percent change from product us outside us total total dollars in millions cymbalta alimta humalog cialis zyprexa humulin forteo evista strattera effient other pharmaceutical products animal health products total net product sales collaboration and other revenue total revenue us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 
collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for erbitux and revenue associated with exenatide in the united states 
sales of cymbalta  a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder  diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain  generalized anxiety disorder  and in the us for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia  increased percent in the us  due to higher prices and  to a lesser extent  increased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
we will lose effective exclusivity for cymbalta in the us in december several manufacturers have received tentative approvals to market generic duloxetine  and we expect generic duloxetine to be introduced in the market immediately following the loss of exclusivity 
while it is difficult to predict the precise impact on cymbalta sales  we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our cymbalta sales  which will have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 
sales of alimta  a treatment for various cancers  increased percent in the us  driven by increased demand and higher prices 
sales outside the us remained flat  as increased demand was offset by lower prices in japan and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of humalog  our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes  decreased percent in the us  due to increased government and commercial rebates as well as the product removal from a large formulary in sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of cialis  a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia bph  increased percent in the us  driven by increased demand and higher prices 
sales outside the us decreased percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by increased demand and higher prices 
sales of zyprexa  a treatment for schizophrenia  acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder  and bipolar maintenance  decreased percent in the united states 
sales outside the us decreased percent 
the decreases were due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us and most major international markets outside of japan  partially offset by growth in japan 
zyprexa sales in japan were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in sales of humulin  an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes  increased percent in the us  driven by higher prices  largely offset by decreased demand 
us sales of humulin were negatively affected by the product removal from a large formulary in  as well as the continued decline in the market for human insulin and the termination of the humulin relion agreement with walmart 
sales outside the us decreased percent  driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by increased volume 
sales of forteo  an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men  increased percent in the us  driven by higher prices  partially offset by decreased volume 
sales outside the us increased percent  primarily due to the increased demand in japan 
sales of evista  a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer  decreased percent in the us  driven by decreased demand  largely offset by higher prices 
sales outside the us decreased percent  driven by decreased volume and  to a lesser extent  the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of strattera  a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children  adolescents  and in the us in adults  decreased percent in the us  due to decreased demand  partially offset by higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand in japan  partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of effient  a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention  including patients undergoing angioplasty  atherectomy  or stent placement  increased percent in the us  driven by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
animal health product sales in the us increased percent  primarily due to increased demand for companion animal products 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen animal health assets in europe see note to the consolidated financial statements  and the growth of other products  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
gross margin  costs  and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by percentage points in to percent 
this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of zyprexa and  to a lesser extent  higher miscellaneous manufacturing costs  partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold  which decreased cost of sales in and increased cost of sales in marketing  selling  and administrative expenses decreased percent in to billion  driven by lower marketing expense resulting from our cost containment efforts 
research and development expenses increased percent to billion  due to higher late stage clinical trial costs 
no acquired ipr d charges were incurred in  compared with million in  all of which was associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in these charges comprised million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase  million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce  million related to the asset impairment of a product delivery device platform  and million related to the withdrawal of xigris 
in  we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million  of which million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions and million related to the withdrawal of xigris 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  income expense was income of million in  compared with expense of million in the increase was driven by income of million recognized from the early payment of the exenatide revenue sharing obligation by amylin 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our effective tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in the increase in reflects the tax impact of the payment received from amylin and the expiration of the research and development tax credit at the end of  partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase 
the effective tax rate for was lower due to a tax benefit on the ipr d charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim  as well as a benefit from the resolution in of the irs audits of tax years  along with certain matters related to see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
operating results financial results we achieved revenue growth of percent to billion in  primarily driven by the collective growth of cymbalta  insulin products  animal health products  alimta  effient  and cialis  partially offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity 
this revenue growth  as well as a lower effective tax rate  was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage  increased marketing  selling  and administrative costs  higher other expense  and the increased impact in of the items noted below 
as a result  net income decreased percent to billion  and eps decreased percent to per share  in as compared to billion  or per share  in in addition to the highlighted items summarized in the executive overview  results also included the following items that affect comparisons us health care reform as a result of higher rebates and subsidies included in health care reform enacted in the us during  total revenue in was reduced by million pretax  or per share 
also  marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased by million pretax  or per share  as a result of the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee 
the highlighted items are summarized as follows us health care reform as a result of higher rebates included in health care reform enacted in the us during  total revenue in was reduced by million pretax  or per share 
we also recorded a one time non cash deferred income tax charge of million  or per share  associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our us retiree health plan 
acquisitions note to the consolidated financial statements we incurred acquired ipr d charges associated with the in licensing arrangement with acrux limited acrux of million pretax  which decreased eps by 
asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges note to the consolidated financial statements we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  or per share  primarily related to severance costs 
revenue our worldwide revenue for increased percent  to billion  driven by the collective growth of cymbalta  insulin products  animal health products  alimta  effient  and cialis  partially offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity 
worldwide sales volume increased percent  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed percent of revenue growth  partially offset by a percent decrease due to lower prices 
the increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of us patent exclusivity for zyprexa and gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine 
revenue in the us increased percent  to billion  due to higher volume  partially offset by lower prices 
revenue outside the us increased percent  to billion  due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices 
total revenue was reduced by million in due to the impact of us health care reform  compared to a reduction of million in the following table summarizes our revenue activity in compared with year ended year ended december  december  percent change from product us outside us total total dollars in millions zyprexa cymbalta alimta humalog cialis humulin evista forteo strattera gemzar other pharmaceutical products animal health products total net product sales collaboration and other revenue total revenue us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 
collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for erbitux and revenue associated with exenatide in the united states 
sales of zyprexa decreased percent in the us  due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us on october  despite a decline in demand for branded zyprexa  us volume increased in primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our six month agreement with prasco laboratories 
this volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded zyprexa and authorized olanzapine 
sales outside the us decreased percent  driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of japan during  partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan 
sales of cymbalta increased percent in the us  driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of alimta increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices and increased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of humalog increased percent in the us  due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of cialis increased percent in the us  primarily due to higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  and higher prices 
sales of humulin increased percent in the us  driven primarily by higher prices for humulin and increased demand attributable to humulin relion 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices 
sales of evista increased percent in the us  due to higher prices  partially offset by decreased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  increased demand  partially offset by lower prices 
sales of forteo decreased percent in the us  driven by lower demand  partially offset by higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  primarily due to increased demand in japan 
sales of strattera increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices  partially offset by lower demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices 
sales of gemzar  a product approved to treat various cancers  decreased percent in the us  due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition  which began in november  following the expiration of the compound patent 
sales outside the us decreased percent  due to generic competition in most major markets 
prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with amylin in november  we recognized in revenue our percent share of byetta gross margin in the united states 
in december  we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination agreement 
in  we recognized total exenatide revenue of million  a decrease of percent 
animal health product sales in the us increased percent  due primarily to increased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen and pfizer animal health assets in europe and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
gross margin  costs  and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by percentage points in to percent 
this decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold  which significantly increased cost of sales in  but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in patent expirations for zyprexa and gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in to billion 
the increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim  as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates 
in addition  higher administrative expenses in the us included million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with us health care reform 
investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due primarily to increased late stage clinical trial costs  including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 
we incurred an ipr d charge of million in  associated with our diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim  compared with million in associated with the in licensing agreement with acrux 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in  including charges of million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions to reduce our cost structure and global workforce  and a special charge of million related to the withdrawal of xigris 
in  we recognized charges totaling million for asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  expense increased million to an expense of million in  due primarily to impairments of acquired ipr d assets in and damages recovered in from generic pharmaceutical companies related to zyprexa patent litigation in germany 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our effective tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in the decrease was due to the tax benefit on the ipr d charge associated with the boehringer ingelheim diabetes collaboration  as well as a benefit from the resolution in of the irs audits of tax years  along with certain matters related to additionally  the tax rate for was increased by a one time charge associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of us health care reform 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled billion compared with billion at december  the decrease was driven by net purchases of billion in investment securities with maturities extending beyond one year  dividends paid of billion  the maturity and repayment of long term debt of billion  purchases of property and equipment of million  and common stock repurchases of million  partially offset by cash from operations of billion  and billion in proceeds from the early payment of amylin revenue sharing obligations and loan 
capital expenditures of million during were million more than in we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million as we invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality  productivity  and capability of our manufacturing  research  and development facilities 
as of december   total debt was billion  a decrease of billion compared with billion at december  the decrease is due primarily to the previously mentioned long term debt maturity and payment of billion 
our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s remain aa and a  respectively 
our ratings outlook from both moody s and standard poor s is stable 
dividends of per share were paid in and was the th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments 
in the fourth quarter of  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of  the quarterly dividend was maintained at per share  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
both domestically and abroad  we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment  the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers  including foreign government backed agencies and suppliers  the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation  the federal government involvement in the us economy  and various international government funding levels 
we continue to focus specifically on the economic health of the european economy  as heightened economic concerns persist 
currently  we believe economic conditions in europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including dividends  share repurchases  capital expenditures  and contractual maturities due on debt in we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program 
various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues  cash flows  and earnings 
through  we expect to lose us patent protection for cymbalta december and evista march 
the loss of exclusivity for cymbalta and evista will likely result in generic competition  generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product  and having a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the us patent for humalog expires in may humalog is currently protected in europe only by formulation patents 
we do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue 
to date  no biosimilar version of humalog has been approved in the us or europe  however  we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of humalog  and it is difficult to predict the likelihood  timing  and impact of biosimilars entering the market 
our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations  liquidity  and financial position through growth in our patent protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period  in the emerging markets  in japan  and in our animal health business 
our expected growth in the emerging markets and japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of patent protected products 
in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would not have a material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen  and the british pound against the euro 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would not have a material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
if required by the arrangement  we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period 
these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december   to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations consist primarily of all open purchase orders as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
we excluded long term income taxes payable of billion  because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
this category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year  none of which are individually material 
we excluded unfunded commitments of million  because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those commitments 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales return  rebate  and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
provisions for returns  rebates  and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
in the us  the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 
when sales occur  we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales 
this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates 
we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
once the product is returned  it is destroyed 
actual product returns have been less than percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  patient assistance programs  and various other programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 
the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg  patent expiries  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later 
because of this time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales returns  rebates  and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
a percent change in our global sales return  rebate  and discount liability at december  would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
the portion of our global sales return  rebate  and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the us was percent and percent as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us sales return  rebate  and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to sales returns  discounts  and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these returns  rebates  and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial condition of the insurers  and the possibility of and length of time for collection 
due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance  we have been and will continue to be largely self insured for product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
annually  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
we use an actuarially determined  plan specific yield curve of high quality  fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates 
in evaluating the expected rate of return  we consider many factors  with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions  asset returns and asset allocations approximately percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results  as well as the discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates of other companies  where applicable 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by million 
a one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by million 
if the discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if the expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by million 
the us plans  including puerto rico  represent approximately percent of the total projected benefit obligation and approximately percent of total plan assets at december  impairment of indefinite lived and long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present 
when required  a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 
several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr d acquired in a business combination  all of which require multiple assumptions 
we utilize the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  patent protection  historical pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
this analysis is performed for each project independently 
for ipr d assets  the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product  as discussed previously in the late stage pipeline section 
the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products 
as such  it is likely that some ipr d assets will become impaired in the future 
the estimated future cash flows  based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation  and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law  the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
as of december   a percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of million and million  respectively

financial expectations for our financial guidance includes an estimated one time benefit of per share associated with the research and development tax credit for that will be recorded in the first quarter of  resulting from the delay in the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of for the full year of  we expect eps to be in the range of to 
we anticipate that total revenue will be between billion and billion 
despite the initial impact of the us cymbalta patent expiration in the fourth quarter of and the loss of the anticipated percent revenue sharing obligation on worldwide exenatide sales  we expect overall revenue growth  driven by a portfolio of products including humalog  humulin  cialis  strattera  forteo  alimta  cymbalta outside the us  effient  tradjenta  and axiron  as well as animal health products 
in addition  significant revenue growth is expected in japan and the emerging markets  particularly china 
we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately percent 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of billion to billion 
research and development expense is expected to be in the range of billion to billion 
other net  income expense is expected to be in a range between million and million of income
