this overall expansion in electronic banking offers the bank s customers means to access the bank s services easily and at their own convenience 
competition the bank experiences substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in making loans 
in attracting deposits and borrowers  the bank competes with commercial banks  savings banks  and savings and loan associations  as well as regional and national insurance companies and non bank financial institutions  regulated small loan companies and local credit unions  regional and national issuers of money market funds and corporate and government borrowers 
within the direct market area of the bank  there are a significant number of offices of competing financial institutions 
in new jersey generally  and in the bank s local market specifically  the bank s most direct competitors are large commercial banks including bank of america  pnc bank  wells fargo and sovereign bank  as well as savings banks and savings and loan associations  including provident savings bank and hudson city savings bank 
the bank is at a competitive disadvantage compared with these larger national and regional commercial and savings banks 
by virtue of their larger capital  asset size or reserves  many of such institutions have substantially greater lending limits ceilings on the amount of credit a bank may provide to a single customer that are linked to the institution s capital and other resources than the bank 
many such institutions are empowered to offer a wider range of services  including trust services  than the bank and  in some cases  have lower funding costs the price a bank must pay for deposits and other borrowed monies used to make loans to customers than the bank 
in addition to having established deposit bases and loan portfolios  these institutions  particularly large national and regional commercial and savings banks  have the financial ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable 
in addition  non bank financial institutions offer services that compete for deposits with the bank 
for example  brokerage firms and insurance companies offer such instruments as short term money market funds  corporate and government securities funds  mutual funds and annuities 
it is expected that competition in these areas will continue to increase 
some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and supervision as the company and the bank and therefore may be able to offer customers more attractive products than the bank 
however  management of the bank believes that loans to small and mid sized businesses and professionals  which represent the main commercial loan business of the bank  are not always of primary importance to the larger banking institutions 
the bank competes for this segment of the market by providing responsive personalized services  making timely local decisions  and acquiring knowledge of its customers and their businesses 
lending activities the bank s lending activities include both commercial and consumer loans 
loan originations are derived from a number of sources including real estate broker referrals  mortgage loan companies  direct solicitation by the bank s loan officers  existing depositors and borrowers  builders  attorneys  walk in customers and  in some instances  other lenders 
the bank has established disciplined and systematic procedures for approving and monitoring loans that vary depending on the size and nature of the loan 

table of contents commercial lending the bank offers a variety of commercial loan services  including term loans  lines of credit  and loans secured by equipment and receivables 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both secured and unsecured  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisition and development of real estate and improvements  and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
the bank also makes construction loans to real estate developers for the acquisition  development and construction of residential subdivisions 
commercial loans are granted based on the borrower s ability to generate cash flow to support its debt obligations and other cash related expenses 
a borrower s ability to repay commercial loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and on the quality of its management 
as a general practice  the bank takes as collateral a security interest in any available real estate  equipment  inventory  receivables or other personal property of its borrowers  although occasionally the bank makes commercial loans on an unsecured basis 
generally  the bank requires personal guaranties of its commercial loans to offset the risks associated with such loans 
residential consumer lending a portion of the bank s lending activities consists of the origination of fixed and adjustable rate residential first mortgage loans secured by owner occupied property located in the bank s primary market areas 
home mortgage lending is unique in that a broad geographic territory may be serviced by originators working from strategically placed offices either within the bank s traditional banking facilities or from affordable storefront locations in commercial buildings 
the bank also offers construction loans  second mortgage home improvement loans and home equity lines of credit 
the bank finances the construction of individual  owner occupied houses on the basis of written underwriting and construction loan management guidelines 
first mortgage construction loans are made to contractors and are secured by real estate that is both a pre sold and a speculation basis 
such loans are also made to qualified individual borrowers and are generally supported by a take out commitment from a permanent lender 
the bank makes residential construction loans to individuals who intend to erect owner occupied housing on a purchased parcel of real estate 
the construction phase of these loans has certain risks  including the viability of the contractor  the contractor s ability to complete the project and changes in interest rates 
in most cases  the bank will sell its mortgage loans with terms of years or more in the secondary market 
the sale to the secondary market allows the bank to hedge against the interest rate risks related to such lending operations 
this brokerage arrangement allows the bank to accommodate its clients demands while eliminating the interest rate risk for the to year period generally associated with such loans 
the bank in most cases requires borrowers to obtain and maintain title  fire  and extended casualty insurance  and  where required by applicable regulations  flood insurance 
the bank maintains its own errors and omissions insurance policy to protect against loss in the event of failure of a mortgagor to pay premiums on fire and other hazard insurance policies 
mortgage loans originated by the bank customarily include a due on sale clause  which gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in certain circumstances  including  without limitation  upon the sale or other disposition by the borrower of the real property subject to a mortgage 
in general  the bank enforces due on sale clauses 
borrowers are typically permitted to refinance or repay loans at their option without penalty 
non residential consumer lending non residential consumer loans made by the bank include loans for automobiles  recreation vehicles  and boats  as well as personal loans secured and unsecured and deposit account secured loans 
the bank also conducts various indirect lending activities through established retail companies in its market areas 
non residential consumer loans are attractive to the bank because they typically have a shorter term and carry higher interest rates than are charged on other types of loans 
non residential consumer loans  however  do pose additional risk of collectability when compared to traditional types of loans  such as residential mortgage loans 

table of contents consumer loans are granted based on employment and financial information solicited from prospective borrowers as well as credit records collected from various reporting agencies 
the stability of the borrower  willingness to pay and credit history are the primary factors to be considered 
the availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such a loan 
the bank seeks collateral that can be assigned and has good marketability with a clearly adequate margin of value 
the geographic area of the borrower is another consideration  with preference given to borrowers in the bank s primary market areas 
supervision and regulation banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy 
in furtherance of those goals  congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted a myriad of legislation that governs banks  bank holding companies and the banking industry 
this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection of the company s shareholders or creditors 
descriptions of  and references to  the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries thereof  and do not purport to be complete 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
state and federal regulations the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
as a bank holding company  the company is subject to inspection  examination and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board and is required to file with the federal reserve board an annual report and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bhca 
the federal reserve board may also make examinations of the company and its subsidiaries 
the company is subject to capital standards similar to  but separate from  those applicable to the bank 
under the bhca  bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies generally may not acquire the ownership or control of more than of the voting shares  or substantially all of the assets  of any company  including a bank or another bank holding company  without the federal reserve board s prior approval 
the company has not applied to become a financial holding company but did obtain such approval to acquire the shares of the bank 
a bank holding company that does not qualify as a financial holding company is generally limited in the types of activities in which it may engage to those that the federal reserve board had recognized as permissible for bank holding companies prior to the date of enactment of the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of for example  a holding company and its banking subsidiary are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services 
at present  the company does not engage in any significant activity other than owning the bank 
in addition to federal bank holding company regulation  the company is registered as a bank holding company with the new jersey department of banking and insurance the department 
the company is required to file with the department copies of the reports it files with the federal banking and securities regulators 
the federal reserve board has issued a supervisory letter to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate or defer or severely limit dividends including  for example  when net income available for shareholders for the past four quarters net of previously paid dividends paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends 
the letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the federal reserve of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company s capital at the beginning of the quarter below the capital outstanding at the end of the quarter 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry  including significant regulatory and compliance changes such as  among other things  i enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies  ii increased capital and liquidity requirements  iii increased regulatory examination fees  iv changes to assessments to be paid to the fdic for federal deposit insurance  and v numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthen safety and soundness for  the financial services sector 
additionally  the dodd frank act established a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the fdic 

table of contents effective in july  the dodd frank act eliminated federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
this significant change to existing law has not had an adverse impact on our net interest margin for the years ended december  and the dodd frank act also changed the base for fdic deposit insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution  rather than on deposits 
the dodd frank act also increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per account  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts and interest on lawyer trust accounts ioltas where the accrued interest is paid to state bar associations or other organizations to fund legal assistance programs have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the legislation also increased the required minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund  from to of insured deposits  and directed the fdic to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than billion in assets  including the bank 
the dodd frank act requires publicly traded companies to give their stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation say on pay and so called golden parachute payments 
it also provides that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose clawback policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements 
because the company qualifies as a smaller reporting company under the rules of the securities and exchange commission  the say on pay requirement will become applicable to the company at the company s annual meeting of shareholders 
the dodd frank act created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets  which authority does not extend to the bank at this time since we do not meet the asset threshold 
the dodd frank act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws 
the dodd frank act requires minimum leverage tier and risk based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies  which exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as tier capital  such as trust preferred securities  however  bank holding companies with assets of less than billion as of december  are permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before may  as tier capital and bank holding companies with assets of less than million are permitted to continue to issue trust preferred securities and have them count as tier capital 
it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the dodd frank act and certain yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks 
however  it is expected that at a minimum  they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense 
capital adequacy the company is required to comply with minimum capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve board 
there are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies and the depository institutions that they own a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for a bank holding company to be considered in compliance 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia required each federal banking agency to revise its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
in addition  pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations  specifying the levels at which a bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution 

table of contents the regulations implementing these provisions of fdicia provide that a bank will be classified as well capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of at least percent  and iv meets certain other requirements 
a bank will be classified as adequately capitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent  iii has a tier leverage ratio of a at least percent  or b at least percent if the bank was rated in its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  and iv does not meet the definition of well capitalized 
a bank will be classified as undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of a less than percent  or b less than percent if the bank was rated in its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
a bank will be classified as significantly undercapitalized if it i has a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  ii has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or iii has a tier leverage ratio of less than percent 
an institution will be classified as critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than percent 
an insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if the fdic has determined i that the insured depository institution is in unsafe or unsound condition or ii that  in the most recent examination of the insured depository institution  the insured depository institution received and has not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality  management  earnings  or liquidity 
as of december   the bank s capital ratios exceed the requirements to be considered a well capitalized institution under these regulations 
the risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies such as the company currently require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit of 
at least half of the total capital is required to be tier capital  consisting principally of common shareholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
the remainder of the total capital tier capital may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance 
at december   the company maintained a tier capital ratio of and total qualifying capital ratio of 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio tier capital to total assets guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
banking organizations with supervisory  financial  operational  or managerial weaknesses  as well as organizations that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth  are expected to maintain capital ratios well above the minimum levels 
moreover  higher capital ratios may be required for any bank holding company if warranted by its particular circumstances or risk profile 
in all cases  bank holding companies should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of the risks  including the volume and severity of problem loans  to which they are exposed 
at december   the company s leverage ratio was 
the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the us in total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more and emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
it is optional for other banks 
in december  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions  referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer 
the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating tier common equity will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the basel committee also announced that a countercyclical buffer of to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer 

table of contents in june  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules that would revise their risk based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with basel iii and certain provisions of the dodd frank act 
the proposed rules would apply to all depository institutions  top tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and top tier savings and loan holding companies banking organizations 
among other things  the proposed rules establish a new minimum common equity tier capital ratio of of risk weighted assets and a higher minimum tier risk based capital ratio of up from the present 
additionally  the us implementation of basel iii contemplates that  for banking organizations with less than billion in assets  the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier capital would be phased out over a ten year period 
the proposed rules also required unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements 
in addition  the proposed rules limit a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of a specified amount of common equity tier capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements 
the proposed rules indicated that the final rule would become effective on january   and the changes set forth in the final rules will be phased in from january  through january  however  the federal bank regulatory agencies indicated in november that they did not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on january  the federal bank regulatory agencies did not specify a new deadline 
on may   the company established st constitution capital trust ii  a delaware business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the company trust ii  for the sole purpose of issuing million of trust preferred securities the capital securities 
trust ii utilized the million proceeds along with  invested in trust ii by the company to purchase  of floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by the company and due to mature on june  the capital securities were issued in connection with a pooled offering involving approximately other financial institution holding companies 
all of the capital securities were sold to a single pooling vehicle 
the floating rate junior subordinated debentures are the only asset of trust ii and have terms that mirror the capital securities 
these debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity after june  trust ii is obligated to distribute all proceeds of a redemption of these debentures  whether voluntary or upon maturity  to holders of the capital securities 
the company s obligation with respect to the capital securities and the debentures  when taken together  provide a full and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis by the company of the obligations of trust ii to pay amounts when due on the capital securities 
interest payments on the floating rate junior subordinated debentures flow through trust ii to the pooling vehicle 
on december   pursuant to the troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program the cpp under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  the company entered into a letter agreement  including the securities purchase agreement standard terms  with the united states department of the treasury the treasury  pursuant to which the company issued and sold  and the treasury purchased i  shares of the company s fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b preferred stock series b and ii a ten year warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  no par value  at an initial exercise price of per share  for aggregate cash consideration of million 
as a result of the declarations of stock dividends to holders of common stock since the issuance of the warrant  the shares of common stock underlying the two warrants issued as replacements to the original warrant have been adjusted to  shares and the initial exercise price has been adjusted to per share 
on october   the company repurchased all of the outstanding shares of the preferred stock series b from the treasury  and the warrant was sold by the treasury on november  and bifurcated into two warrants that were issued to two affiliated purchasers 
as of the date hereof  two warrants remain outstanding 
the two new warrants provide for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of the company s common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of the company s common stock 
the outstanding two warrants are immediately exercisable and expire in december 
table of contents restrictions on dividends the primary source of cash to pay dividends  if any  to the company s shareholders and to meet the company s obligations is dividends paid to the company by the bank 
dividend payments by the bank to the company are subject to the new jersey banking act of the banking act and the federal deposit insurance act the fdia 
under the banking act and the fdia  the bank may not pay any dividends if after paying the dividend  it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements 
in addition to these explicit limitations  the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
depending upon the circumstances  the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividend that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary 
a bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent 
the company has never paid a cash dividend and the company s board of directors has no plans to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future 
priority on liquidation the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the rights of the company as the sole shareholder of the bank  and therefore the rights of the company s creditors and shareholders  to participate in the distributions and earnings of the bank when the bank is not in bankruptcy  are subject to various state and federal law restrictions as discussed above under the heading restrictions on dividends 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution such as the bank  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of an obligation of the institution to its shareholders the company or any shareholder or creditor of the company 
the claims on the bank by creditors include obligations in respect of federal funds purchased and certain other borrowings  as well as deposit liabilities 
financial institution legislation the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the modernization act became effective in early the modernization act allows bank holding companies meeting management  capital and community reinvestment act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non banking activities than is permissible for a bank holding company  including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies  if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  it files a certification  effective in days  and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals  allows banks to establish subsidiaries to engage in certain activities which a financial holding company could engage in  if the bank meets certain management  capital and community reinvestment act standards  allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks and removes various restrictions that currently apply to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies  and establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to financial holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations 
the modernization act modified other laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 

table of contents the modernization act also amended the bhca and the bank merger act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts 
additional proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking and financial services industry are frequently introduced in congress  in state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the company cannot be determined at this time 
the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley act  which became law on july   added new legal requirements affecting corporate governance  accounting and corporate reporting for companies with publicly traded securities 
the sarbanes oxley act provides for  among other things a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its directors and executive officers except for loans made by a bank subject to regulation o of the federal reserve board  independence requirements for audit committee members  disclosure of whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert as such term is defined by the securities and exchange commission sec and if not  why not  independence requirements for outside auditors  a prohibition by a company s registered public accounting firm from performing statutorily mandated audit services for the company if the company s chief executive officer  chief financial officer  comptroller  chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent positions had been employed by such firm and participated in the audit of such company during the one year period preceding the audit initiation date  certification of financial statements and annual and quarterly reports by the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate misconduct  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  two business day filing requirements for insiders filing forms  disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a form k for a change or waiver of such code  real time filing of periodic reports  posting of certain sec filings and other information on the company s website  the reporting of securities violations up the ladder by both in house and outside attorneys  restrictions on the use of non gaap financial measures  the formation of a public accounting oversight board  and various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 

table of contents additionally  section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  include in its annual report i a management s report on internal control over financial reporting assessing the company s internal controls  and ii if the company is an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer  an auditor s attestation report  completed by the registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues an accountant s report which is included in the company s annual report  attesting to the effectiveness of management s internal control assessment 
each of the national stock exchanges  including the nasdaq global market where the company s common stock is listed  have in place corporate governance rules  including rules requiring director independence  and the adoption of charters for the nominating  corporate governance  and audit committees 
these rules are intended to  among other things  make the board of directors independent of management and allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors 
these burdens increase the company s legal and accounting fees and the amount of time that the board of directors and management must devote to corporate governance issues 
section a of sarbanes oxley requires the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer to certify that the company s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made  in light of circumstances under which they were made  not misleading

as part of the usa patriot act  signed into law on october   congress adopted the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the act 
the act authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks  bank holding companies  broker dealers and insurance companies 
among its other provisions  the act requires each financial institution i to establish an anti money laundering program  ii to establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in united states private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non united states persons or their representatives  and iii to avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  the act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
the department of treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence requirements 
these regulations require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records  encourage cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  prohibit the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti money laundering compliance program 
as a new jersey chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to supervision and examination by the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
the bank is also subject to regulation by the fdic  which is its principal federal bank regulator 
the bank must comply with various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law  including the maintenance of reserves against deposits  restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon  limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the services that may be offered  and restrictions on dividends as described in the preceding section 
consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank 
in addition to the impact of regulation  commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the federal reserve board which influence the money supply and credit availability in the national economy 

table of contents community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act cra  as implemented by fdic regulations  a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with cra 
cra requires the fdic to assess an institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the applicable institution 
the cra requires public disclosure of an institution s cra rating and requires that the fdic provide a written evaluation of an institution s cra performance utilizing a four tiered descriptive rating system 
an institution s cra rating is considered in determining whether to grant charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
performance less than satisfactory may be the basis for denying an application 
at its last cra examination  the bank was rated satisfactory under cra 
firrea under the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea  a depository institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
these provisions have commonly been referred to as firrea s cross guarantee provisions 
further  under firrea  the failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities 
firrea also imposes certain independent appraisal requirements upon a bank s real estate lending activities and further imposes certain loan to value restrictions on a bank s real estate lending activities 
the bank regulators have promulgated regulations in these areas 
insurance of deposits the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic 
due to the recent difficult economic conditions  deposit insurance per account owner was raised to  that limit was made permanent by the dodd frank act 
the fdicia is applicable to depository institutions and deposit insurance 
the fdicia requires the fdic to establish a risk based assessment system for all insured depository institutions 
under this legislation  the fdic is required to establish an insurance premium assessment system based upon i the probability that the insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution  ii the likely amount of the loss  and iii the revenue needs of the insurance fund 
in compliance with this mandate  the fdic has developed a matrix that sets the assessment premium for a particular institution in accordance with its capital level and overall rating by the primary regulator 
under the matrix as currently in effect  the assessment rate ranges from to basis points of assessed deposits 
the fdic s transaction account guarantee program the tag program  one of two components of the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlg program  provided participating depository institutions full federal deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
under the tag program  effective december   insured depository institutions that have not opted out of the tag program were subject to a surcharge applied to non interest bearing transaction deposit account balances in excess of  which surcharge was added to the institution s existing risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the bank opted into the tag program  which was initially set to expire on december  on august   the fdic extended the program until june   and revised the annualized assessment rate charged for the guarantee to between and basis points  depending on the institution s risk category  on balances in noninterest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of  on april   the fdic announced a second extension of the program until december  the bank opted into the extensions 

table of contents the dodd frank act provides that non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance coverage from december  through december  as of january   the maximum deposit insurance coverage per account holder was  for all depository accounts  including non interest bearing transaction accounts  money market accounts  now accounts and savings accounts 
the temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage had replaced the tag program that expired on december  and did not apply to all accounts covered under the tag program 
it covered only noninterest bearing transaction accounts and interest on lawyer trust accounts ioltas where the accrued interest is paid to state bar associations or other organizations to fund legal assistance programs 
beginning january   low interest consumer checking accounts now accounts and all other fiduciary accounts maintained by attorneys or other entities are no longer eligible for the unlimited deposit insurance coverage 
unlike the tag program  which allowed banks to opt in  the temporary unlimited insurance coverage applied at all fdic insured institutions and was no longer funded by separate premiums 
the second component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  the debt guarantee program  guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of participating organizations 
the bank opted not to participate in this component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
in february  the fdic adopted final rules to implement changes required by the dodd frank act with respect to the fdic assessment rules 
in particular  the definition of an institution deposit insurance assessment base is being changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity 
in addition  the fdic is revising the deposit insurance assessment rates down 
the changes were effective april  the new initial base assessment rates range from to basis points for risk category i banks to basis points for risk category iv banks 
risk category ii and iii banks will have an initial base assessment rate of or basis points  respectively 
the new rates and assessment base have reduced our current fdic insurance assessment for compared to however  if the risk category of the bank changes adversely  our fdic insurance premiums could increase 
lending limits in january  the new jersey department of banking and insurance issued an order requiring a new jersey chartered bank s calculation of lending limits to any person or entity to include credit exposure to such person or entity arising from a derivative transaction  repurchase agreement  reverse repurchase agreement  securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction 
previously  such credit exposure was not included in a new jersey chartered bank s calculation of lending limits 
new jersey chartered banks will have until july  to comply with the operative provisions of the order  which include compliance with all of the rules set forth in the office of the comptroller of the currency s interim final rule on lending limits codified at cfr pts 
 and 
the company does not anticipate this change in the calculation of lending limits to have a significant impact on its operations 
item a 
risk factors 
the following are some important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forward looking statement 
these are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k and the company s other filings with the sec 
a prolonging of the economic downturn or the return of negative developments in the financial services industry could negatively impact our operations 
the global and us economic downturn has resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general with the possibility of a slow recovery or a fall back into recession 
the federal reserve  in an attempt to help the overall economy  has kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate  the purchase of mortgage backed securities and the purchase of the treasury securities 
if the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise which may negatively impact the housing markets and the us economic recovery 
a prolonging of the economic downturn or the return of negative developments in the financial services industry could negatively impact our operations by causing an increase in our provision for loan losses and a deterioration of our loan portfolio 
such a downturn may also adversely affect our ability to originate or sell loans 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact our financial performance 
a prolonging or worsening of the downturn affecting the economy and or the real estate market in our primary market area would adversely affect our loan portfolio and our growth potential 

table of contents much of the company s lending is in northern and central new jersey 
as a result of this geographic concentration  a further continued significant broad based deterioration in economic conditions in the new jersey metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the company s loan portfolio  results of operations and future growth potential 
a prolonged decline in economic conditions in our market area could restrict borrowers ability to pay outstanding principal and interest on loans when due  and consequently  adversely affect the cash flows and results of operation of the company s business 
the company s loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate collateral located in the state of new jersey 
conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the company s loans are located strongly influence the level of the company s non performing loans and results of operations 
a continued decline in the new jersey real estate markets could adversely affect the company s loan portfolio 
decreases in local real estate values would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans 
adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
the company faces significant competition 
the company faces significant competition from many other banks  savings institutions and other financial institutions which have branch offices or otherwise operate in the company s market area 
non bank financial institutions  such as securities brokerage firms  insurance companies and money market funds  engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business  which has also led to greater competition 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the company  including larger capital bases that allow them to attract customers seeking larger loans than the company is able to accommodate and the ability to aggressively advertise their products and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable 
there can be no assurance that the company and the bank will be able to successfully compete with these entities in the future 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the spread between the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates received on loans and other investments narrows  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
this also includes the risk that interest earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa repricing risk  the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk  and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability maturities yield curve risk 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability 
during the last four years it has been the policy of the federal reserve board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
as a result  yields have been at levels lower than were available prior to on securities we have purchased and loans we have originated 
consequently  the average yield on our interest earning assets has decreased during the recent low interest rate environment 
as a general matter  our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets  which has contributed to increases in net interest income the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities in the short term 
however  our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels  while the average yield on our interest earning assets may continue to decrease 
the federal reserve board has indicated its intention to maintain low interest rates in the near future 
accordingly  our net interest income may decrease  which may have an adverse affect on our profitability 

table of contents the company is subject to risks associated with speculative construction lending 
the risks associated with speculative construction lending include the borrower s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget  the sale of the project within projected absorption periods  the economic risks associated with real estate collateral  and the potential of a rising interest rate environment 
such loans may include financing the development and or construction of residential subdivisions 
this activity may involve financing land purchase  infrastructure development ie roads  utilities  etc  as well as construction of residences or multi family dwellings for subsequent sale by developer builder 
because the sale of developed properties is integral to the success of developer business  loan repayment may be especially subject to the volatility of real estate market values 
management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to minimize the inherent risks of speculative commercial real estate construction lending 
further  management concentrates lending efforts with developers demonstrating successful performance on marketable projects within the bank s lending areas 
our mortgage warehouse lending business represents a significant portion of our overall lending activity and is subject to numerous risks 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio  the inherent primary risks are deteriorating credit quality  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one  or a combination  of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of the mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
risks associated with these loans include  without limitation  i credit risks relating to the mortgage bankers that borrow from us  ii the risk of intentional misrepresentation or fraud by any of such mortgage bankers  iii changes in the market value of mortgage loans originated by the mortgage banker  the sale of which is the expected source of repayment of the borrowings under a warehouse line of credit  due to changes in interest rates during the time in warehouse  or iv unsalable or impaired mortgage loans so originated  which could lead to decreased collateral value and the failure of a purchaser of the mortgage loan to purchase the loan from the mortgage banker 
the impact of interest rates on our mortgage warehouse business can be significant 
changes in interest rates can impact the number of residential mortgages originated and initially funded under mortgage warehouse lines of credit and thus our mortgage warehouse related revenues 
a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans 
conversely  in a constant or increasing rate environment  we would expect fewer loans to be originated 
although we use models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage related revenues  the estimates of net income produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand  prepayment speeds and other factors which may overstate or understate actual subsequent experience 
further  the concentration of our loan portfolio on loans originated through our mortgage warehouse business increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio because of the concentration of loans in a single line of business  namely one to four family residential mortgage lending  and in a particular segment of that business  namely mortgage warehouse lending 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loan and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 

table of contents in addition  bank regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs or reclassify loans 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs or loan reclassifications as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state government regulation impacts the company s operations 
the operations of the company and the bank are heavily regulated and will be affected by present and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities 
in particular  the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board to implement its objectives are changes in the discount rate charged on bank borrowings 
it is not possible to predict what changes  if any  will be made to the monetary policies of the federal reserve board or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such changes may have on the future business and earnings prospects of the company 
the company and the bank are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
compliance with the rules and regulations of these agencies may be costly and may limit growth and restrict certain activities  including payment of dividends  investments  loans and interest rate charges  interest rates paid on deposits  and locations of offices 
the bank is also subject to capitalization guidelines set forth in federal legislation and regulations 
the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time  and we cannot predict the impact of these changes on our business and profitability 
because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies  the cost of compliance could adversely affect the company s result of operations 
legislative and regulatory reforms may materially adversely impact our financial condition  results of operation  liquidity  or stock price 
the dodd frank act restructures the regulation of depository institutions 
the dodd frank act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in also included was the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau  a new federal agency administering consumer and fair lending laws  a function that was previously performed by the depository institution regulators 
the federal preemption of state laws currently accorded federally chartered depository institutions has been reduced as well 
we expect that many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time  and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
in addition  international banking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significant changes in the regulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companies to support their businesses 
the new international rules  known as basel iii  generally increase the capital required to be held and narrow the types of instruments which will qualify as providing appropriate capital and impose a new liquidity measurement 
the basel iii requirements are complex and will be phased in over many years 
the basel iii rules do not apply to us banks or holding companies automatically 
among other things  the dodd frank act requires us regulators to reform the system under which the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions  individually and systemically  are regulated 
that reform effort will include the regulation of capital and liquidity 
in june  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules that would revise their risk based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with basel iii and certain provisions of the dodd frank act 
among other things  the proposed rules establish a new minimum common equity tier capital ratio of of risk weighted assets and a higher minimum tier risk based capital ratio of up from the present 
the proposed rules indicated that the final rule would become effective on january   and the changes set forth in the final rules will be phased in from january  through january  however  the federal bank regulatory agencies indicated in november that they did not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on january  the federal bank regulatory agencies did not specify a new deadline 

table of contents one likely effect of the proposed rules tightening of us capital requirements would be to increase our cost of capital  among other things 
any permanent significant increase in our cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products  the types of products we could offer profitably  our overall profitability  and our overall growth opportunities  among other things 
although most financial institutions would be affected  these business impacts could be felt unevenly  depending upon the business and product mix of each institution 
other potential effects could include less ability to repurchase our common shares  higher dilution of common shareholders  and a higher risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in an adverse economic cycle 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market constantly changes and recently  given the uncertainty in the financial markets  has fluctuated widely 
from the beginning of fiscal year through the end of fiscal year  our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
we expect that the market closing price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  events negatively impacting the financial services industry which result in a general decline in the market valuation of our common stock  announcements of material developments affecting our operations or our dividend policy  future sales of our equity securities  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  and general domestic economic and market conditions 
in addition  recently the stock market generally has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results 
the bank is subject to liquidity risk 
liquidity risk is the potential that the bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due  capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise  or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 

table of contents liquidity is required to fund various obligations  including credit commitments to borrowers  mortgage and other loan originations  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of borrowings  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole 
if we become unable to obtain funds when needed  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn  our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to liquidity risk 
our recurring cash requirements  at the holding company level  primarily consist of interest expense on junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts 
holding company cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank 
while we expect that the holding company will continue to receive dividends from the bank sufficient to satisfy holding company cash needs  in the event that the bank has insufficient resources or is subject to legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  the bank may be unable to provide dividends or a sufficient level of dividends to the holding company  in that event  the holding company may have insufficient funds to satisfy its obligations as they become due 
future growth  operating results or regulatory requirements may require us to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
to the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition  we may be required to raise additional capital 
our ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets  which are outside of our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business 
these actions could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
higher fdic deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition 
in february  the fdic adopted final rules to implement changes required by the dodd frank act with respect to the fdic assessment rules 
in particular  the definition of an institution deposit insurance assessment base is being changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity 
in addition  the fdic is revising the deposit insurance assessment rates down 
the changes were effective april  the new initial base assessment rates range from to basis points for risk category i banks to basis points for risk category iv banks 
risk category ii and iii banks will have an initial base assessment rate of or basis points  respectively 
the new rates and assessment base have reduced our current fdic insurance assessment for compared to however  if the risk category of the bank changes adversely  our fdic insurance premiums could increase 
recent insured depository institution failures  as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions  have significantly increased the loss provisions of the fdic  resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to historical lows 
effective january   the fdic increased the designated reserve ratio from to 
in addition  the dodd frank act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit on fdic deposit insurance coverage to  per insured depositor  retroactive to january   which may result in even larger losses to the deposit insurance fund 

table of contents the fdic may further increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the deposit insurance fund to prescribed statutory target levels 
an increase in the risk category for the bank or in the assessment rates could have an adverse effect on the bank earnings 
the fdic may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition  or has violated applicable laws  regulations or orders 
future offerings of debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources or  if our or the bank s capital ratios fall below the required minimums  we or the bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities  including medium term notes  trust preferred securities  senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution 
the company may lose lower cost funding sources 
checking  savings  and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments  the company could lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing its funding costs and reducing the company s net interest income and net income 
there may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition 
some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the company s assets or liabilities and financial results 
the company identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses  security impairment  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
under each of these policies  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  using different assumptions  or as new information becomes available 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of the company s external financial statements 
recently  fasb has proposed new accounting standards related to fair value accounting and accounting for leases that could materially change the company s financial statements in the future 
in addition  accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb  sec  banking regulators and the company s independent auditors may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the company s control  can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the company reports its financial results and condition 
in certain cases  the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently also retroactively which may result in the company restating prior period financial statements in material amounts 
the company encounters continuous technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the company s operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company is subject to operational risk 
the company faces the risk that the design of its controls and procedures  including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders  may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented  thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may also be subject to disruptions of its systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control including  for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
the company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is the company and to the risk that the company s or its vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
the company s performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
there is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees 
in addition  the company faces increasing competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals 
the company s business operations could be adversely affected if it were unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees 
there may be claims and litigation 
from time to time as part of the company s normal course of business  customers make claims and take legal action against the company based on actions or inactions of the company 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the company  they may result in financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the company and its products and services 
this may also impact customer demand for the company s products and services

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included elsewhere in this report 
throughout the following sections  the company refers to st constitution bancorp and  as the context requires  its wholly owned subsidiary  st constitution bank the bank and the bank s wholly owned subsidiaries  st constitution investment company of new jersey  inc  fcb assets holdings  inc  st constitution title agency  llc  south newman street corp 
and new york avenue  llc 
st constitution capital trust ii trust ii  a subsidiary of the company  is not included in the company s consolidated financial statements as it is a variable interest entity and the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policies with respect to the methodologies for the determination of the allowance for loan losses and for determining other than temporary security impairment involve a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
these critical policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available to it  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or should the central new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
real estate acquired through foreclosure  or a deed in lieu of foreclosure  is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition or transfer  and subsequently at the lower of its new cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
adjustments to the carrying value at the date of acquisition or transfer are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
the carrying value of the individual properties is subsequently adjusted to the extent it exceeds estimated fair value less estimated selling costs  at which time a provision for losses on such real estate is charged to operations 
appraisals are critical in determining the fair value of the other real estate owned amount 
assumptions for appraisals are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable 
management utilizes various inputs to determine the fair value of its investment portfolio 
to the extent they exist  unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets level or quoted prices on similar assets level are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
in the absence of quoted prices  valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 
valuation techniques are based on various assumptions  including  but not limited to cash flows  discount rates  rate of return  adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity  and liquidation values 
a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level inputs 
the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
management must periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the securities valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other than temporary 
the analysis of other than temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions  including  but not limited to  the length of time an investment s book value is greater than fair value  the severity of the investment s decline  as well as any credit deterioration of the investment 
if the decline in value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value and a non cash impairment charge is recognized in the period of such evaluation 
rights offering to existing shareholders during the third quarter of  the company launched a shareholders common stock rights offering  which expired on october  the company received gross proceeds of million from holders of subscription rights who exercised their basic subscription rights and from holders who exercised the over subscription privilege 
the rights offering was fully subscribed 
accordingly  the company issued a total of  shares of common stock to the holders of subscription rights who validly exercised their subscription rights  including pursuant to the exercise of the over subscription privilege 

table of contents acquisition of three branches in on march   the bank acquired certain deposit and other liabilities  real estate and related assets of the rocky hill  hillsborough and hopewell  new jersey banking offices from another financial institution for a purchase price of million the march acquisition 
the company accounted for the march acquisition using applicable accounting guidance regarding business combinations 
the fair value of savings and transaction deposit accounts acquired was assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand 
a core deposit intangible was ascribed to the value of non maturity deposits based upon an independent third party evaluation which was prepared using the actual characteristics of the deposits and assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
certificates of deposit accounts were valued utilizing a discounted cash flows analysis based upon the underlying accounts contractual maturities and interest rates 
the present value of the projected cash flow was then determined using discount rates based upon certificate of deposit interest rates available in the marketplace for accounts with similar terms 
the fair value of the three branch buildings was determined via appraisals performed by qualified independent third party appraisers 
the fair value of loans acquired  all of which were performing  was assumed to approximate amortized cost based upon the small size and nature of those loans 
as a result of the march acquisition  the three branches became branches of the bank 
included in the march acquisition were the assumption of deposit liabilities of million  primarily consisting of demand deposits  and the acquisition of cash of approximately million  fixed assets of approximately million  which includes  without limitation  ownership of the real estate and improvements upon which the branches are situated  and loans of  the bank recorded goodwill of approximately million and a core deposit intangible asset of approximately million as a result of the march acquisition 
results of operations the company reported net income for the year ended december  of  an increase of from the  reported for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increases in net interest income and noninterest income  which were partially offset by increases in non interest expenses and income taxes during the year ended december  compared to the prior year

other factors that may affect the bank s operating results are general and local economic and competitive conditions  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the net interest margin for the year ended december  was as compared to the net interest margin recorded for the year ended december   an increase of basis points 
the company will continue to closely monitor the mix of earning assets and funding sources to maximize net interest income during this challenging interest rate environment 
net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s non gaap net revenues for the year ended december  net interest income also depends upon the relative amount of average interest earning assets  average interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them  respectively 

table of contents the following tables set forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average yield or rate for the years ended december   and the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively

provision for loan losses management considers a complete review of the following specific factors in determining the provisions for loan losses historical losses by loan category  non accrual loans  and problem loans as identified through internal classifications  collateral values  and the growth and size of the loan portfolio

included in non accrual loans are loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest and or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower and have not performed in accordance with the restructured terms 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due  unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans increased by  to  at december   from  at december  as the disruptions in the financial system and the real estate market during the past few years required the bank to charge off  of loans during compared to charge offs of  during the bank recorded recoveries on previously charged off loans of  and  during and  respectively 
the major segments of non accrual loans consist of commercial loans  commercial real estate loans and sba loans which are in the process of collection and residential real estate which is either in foreclosure or under contract to close after december  the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  non performing loans to total loans increased to at december  from at december  loan quality is still considered to be sound 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets decreased by  to  at december  from  at december  other real estate owned decreased by  to  at december  from  at december  during  the bank was able to successfully dispose of properties with an aggregate carrying value of  for a net loss of  the bank recorded loss provisions against other real estate owned properties of  during and  during the bank was able to secure the title for other properties totaling  during  which will help to facilitate their disposal by sale process 
non performing assets represented of total assets at december  and at december

five of these loans totaling  are included in the above table as non accrual loans  the remaining five loans totaling  are considered performing 
management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for delinquent loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less the estimated selling costs or the initially recorded amount 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because a collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses and related provision the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the inherent primary risks are deteriorating credit quality  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one  or a combination  of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all  or part  of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans and construction loans are charged off against the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses

the federal reserve board has issued a supervisory letter to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate or defer or severely limit dividends  including  for example  when net income available for shareholders for the past four quarters net of previously paid dividends paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends 
the letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the federal reserve of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company s capital at the beginning of the quarter below the capital outstanding at the end of the quarter

liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 

table of contents the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb which further supports and enhances liquidity 
during  fhlb replaced its overnight line of credit and one month overnight repricing line of credit facilities available to member banks with a fully secured line of up to percent of a bank s quarter end total assets

interest rate sensitivity analysis the largest component of the bank s total income is net interest income  and the majority of the bank s financial instruments are composed of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various terms and maturities 
the primary objective of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  and differences in lending and funding rates 
management actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 

table of contents the following tables set forth certain information relating to the bank s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity or repricing and the fair value of such instruments at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  total within one year one year to five years in thousands interest sensitivity period over five years non interest sensitive day day day day total assets cash and due from banks federal funds sold investment securities loans held for sale loans  net of allowance for loan losses other assets sources of funds demand deposits noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing savings deposits time deposits borrowings redeemable subordinated debentures non interest bearing sources asset liability sensitivity gap period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets the bank continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believed that hedging instruments available during were not cost effective  and therefore  focused its efforts on increasing the bank s spread by attracting lower cost retail deposits 
in addition to utilizing the gap ratio for interest rate risk assessment  management utilizes simulation analysis whereby models estimate the variance in net income with a change in interest rates of plus or minus   and basis points over and month periods 
given recent simulations  net interest income would be within policy guidelines regardless of the direction of market rates
